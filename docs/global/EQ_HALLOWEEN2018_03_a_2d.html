<td>Numuu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Phew, this should keep it asleep for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So it really was all riled up by the candy... You've outdone yourself again this year, Neica.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm not happy about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Neica... You're so brilliant. How brightly your handmade candies sparkle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sparkle? Do they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Of course they do! The Ratty wouldn't have been all over them if they didn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Fujika said that last Halloween was bright and fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>She said the whole city sparkled. I don't want to lose! I will definitely make this town sparkle even more than it did back then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>On that note, Mei Fang! Melda! You surely have other options for stunning candy and costumes with you, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Demanding, aren't you? Fine. Feast your eyes on this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ummmm... What are these?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sweet bean pancakes, sweet bean jelly, bracken-starch dumplings...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well? Moved to tears, are you not? These sweet treats are all masterpieces!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>When she went to Wadatsumi, Vivi hand-picked these for me. They are perfectly sweet and delicious. She has such exquisite taste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's not the poi-...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, they are really delicious. I'll give you that. I do like treats from Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>However! They have a fatal flaw! They are boring! They don't sparkle at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Melda! How about the other costumes you prepared?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh, uh, costumes... Right. Truthfully, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>All of the costumes are made for my babies... Like the Ratty you just saw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>They suit my babies so wonderfully, and certainly make them very happy, but, as human proportions go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So, basically, all of the costumes you prepared are for animals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You... Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>H-Hozuki! It's okay! Everything will work out! Leave the treats to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But then it will be the same as last year. It's all pointless if it's the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I don't want to lose. The real deal should be sparkly and so bright that it doesn't lose to anything or anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I can't lose! Somehow, we'll just have to make the things that we have now sparkle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You want it that badly? To make everything sparkle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes. No matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I do not really understand it, but I suppose I have no choice except to get on board, in order to make this a most wonderful experience for everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm sorry that my misunderstanding made even more work for everyone. Please, let me help too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Thank you, you two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>First, we need to somehow make sure these sweets sparkle properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Wh-what was that? Screaming?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It came from over there! Look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Numa, numu, numaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The Ratty! He's back on his feet again already?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>O-ow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What do you mean, what happened?! That stupid mouse came charging through here and ran into me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh dear. It's all excited again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Uh oh. Things are getting dangerous. We need to catch it, or else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hey, wait a second! Are you that mouse's owner?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>So what if I am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ah! Ow, ow, ow! They're broken! They're definitely broken! All of the big bones in my body are broken!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You better pay for the medical expenses! It's going to be sooooo expensive. Right, everyone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>An eye for an eye, or money to pay for damages! You pick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wh-what? We'll apologize for the trouble, but can you stop with this dull trick-or-treat now?</td>
</tr>
