<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>So here you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I was thinking about what you told us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You shouldn't rush for an answer. People tend to lose sight of what is truly important when they charge forward too eagerly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Though I suppose I am the one that rushed you. I haven't even asked you about your purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>My purpose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why did you seek out the Sephira? Why have you continued to fight as the Blue Tongues?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I—no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We are searching for Agatha, an important family member.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The surviving member of the Wratharis royal family? I have heard that she holds the Sacred Stone Satna within her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I don't care about any of that. I just need to see her again and...apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I need to apologize for not being able to protect her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No matter how much I searched for her, I just couldn't find her. She disappears like mist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But then I heard that the Sephira have some means of pinpointing the whereabouts of the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>When the balance of the world collapses, the Sacred Stones will gather to bring about the end of an era.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I heard that the Sephira have the responsibility to oversee such an event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's an old legend. Even when I lived, the Sephira were nothing but a shell of what they used to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>When you...lived?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sorry. Forget about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It is true that we of the Sephira can foresee the whereabouts of the Sacred Stones, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If this Agatha is a Vessel of Reincarnation, if she has the Sacred Stone within her, then we should be able to find her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Do you mean that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes, but much time has passed since we lost the great tree's blessing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>To perform the ritual, we must be in the proper place at the proper time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Where would that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The lost sacred grounds of my people, the arboreal altar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I didn't think we'd be infiltrating Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm sorry to get you involved in my personal issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's not a problem. Besides, we already got you all tangled up in our problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Sorry, Tina. I wish I could go with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It can't be helped. You can't leave the barrier set around this place, 'cause it's keeping your corruption in check.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Not only that, but we are going to cross the Gluttony Foss border. There may be some chaos in the country, but we should still avoid moving as a large group.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Please be careful, Captain Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I will. Take care of everyone for me, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Um, I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm gathering my comrades from all across the desert. I want you to tell them about what is happening in Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Do not forget that this is not yet the counterattack. We must be sure that all preparations are made before we act.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I need you to provide whatever information you can—the situation in the country, security in the royal capital, the structure of the castle—anything that you can possibly think of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It would be best if we could coordinate things with the rebel forces in Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I was so busy getting out of the country that I never managed to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I see. Well, we let's just do what we can. Is there anything we can use as proof of our intentions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>This is my family crest. They should lend you an ear after you show them this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Thank you. I'll definitely take good care of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Let's get going, Logi, Tina. We're going to be heading out to where my people's village used to be.</td>
</tr>
