<tr>

<td>Huff... Huff... Is that the last of them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Of the ones in the vicinity, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Phew... Good! On to the next location then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How about you take a minute to actually breathe first? You're wheezing like an old man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I am...not! Huff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes you are! Anyway, what do you mean, the next location? We don't know where we're meant to go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh... Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Haste makes waste, Bud. These Taurus are unlike any we've fought before. We need to tread carefully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What?! The Taurus combat force is...gone? All of them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yep. They've been wiped out. From what I hear, they were going up against Taurus at least twice the size of any we've seen before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Not only that, but they've been corrupting the nature of Saga with an incredibly potent miasma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>The Sprite Trio are doing what they can to keep the corruption from spreading using their Ouija.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>However, if the entire combat force couldn't stand against these creatures... Then we can't expect the Sprite Trio to hold out indefinitely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yep. The fiends aren't sitting quietly, either. They're destroying and consuming everything in sight—monsters and people alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The weird thing is that after they've caused a certain amount of destruction, the creatures calm down a bit, like they're satisfied with their progress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But that doesn't even give us time to rest and regroup, because outbreaks of regular Taurus have been on the rise since these Giant Taurus showed up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So they come out to clean up the leftovers, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Come to think of it... It's interesting that they've been consuming everything in sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What if the hunger they're sating isn't an appetite for sustenance, but Alchemia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Their sheer size means that they'd require a lot more Alchemia than regular Taurus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(If I'm right, and the Taurus really are after Alchemia, they could do some serious damage to the Matter...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(And if there are any Sacred Stones hidden in Saga... Things are going to get real ugly, real fast.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Time is of the essence. We need to put a stop to the Taurus before they become too powerful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>We cannot allow Saga to fall to corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>If we don't eradicate the chaos here, it could threaten all of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>(But why are these abnormal Taurus so focused on Saga?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>(Actually...I think I read a report about Judith's father researching something in Saga...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>(That's right... It was about Demonic Soldiers and other ancient lifeforms. He warned that they could pose a serious threat to the entire world if left unchecked.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>(That report was what got him executed. His passion for researching devices both magical and mundane was deemed dangerous, and his research a violation of the taboo on Alchemy.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>(The Holy Order of Babel never gave Judith's father a chance to work alongside them.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>(He had learned too much, I guess. Got too close to finding out about the Cursed Beasts.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>(So he never got to fulfill his life's work.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>(But maybe he would have, if I'd learned all this just a little earlier. I might have been able to change things for the better.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Figuring out what's driving the Taurus will be crucial, but right now we need to focus on stopping them from wreaking any further havoc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>So then as Lord Commander, I know where I must go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>So you ended up coming here to Saga, did you? Huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The Taurus combat force is no more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>They were elite, experienced fighters who knew exactly what they were up against, and these new Taurus wiped them out in one. That doesn't leave us with many options.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So that's why you called us, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>The Sprite Trio are working tirelessly to purify the corruption wherever it spreads.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>While they're taking care of that, we need to do something about the Giant Taurus. We've fought them before, which is more than most people can say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I've already informed the Trio of this plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Okay. Guess we'd better get a move on, then. Wouldn't wanna have to listen to another lecture from anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Sorry. I'm sure you have enough on your plates as it is, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey, what are friends for, right? Besides, we can't let something that big and dangerous just wander around and do whatever it wants!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We already know we can beat them! We've done it before, and we can do it again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Right, Bud?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Bud? Bud!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huh? Uh... Yeah! Exactly! That's what I was thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Don't just make up an answer! You weren't even listening, were you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I-I was so! Anyway, let's just go kick some Giant Taurus butt already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What're you in such a hurry for?! This is important, y'know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'm not in a hurry! I've just got stuff on my mind, unlike you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What's that supposed to mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Like I said... I realize you've got a lot on your plate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Kagura told me. I'm sorry to bother you with this when you're in the middle of rebuilding the Blue Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(It's not like I can just ignore the fact that the people of Saga are at risk.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(Countless lives will be lost if the Giant Taurus threat isn't dealt with soon...and I would hate to turn down a favor from a friend.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(But I'm the captain of the Blue Flame Guard, aren't I?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(It wouldn't be right for me to leave the Guard while it's still in turmoil...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What are you doing? If you're going, get moving already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I-I never said I was going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You didn't have to! It's practically seeping from your pores!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>From my...pores?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What's your problem, anyway? You followed me when I told you not to. Why are you hesitating now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That was...different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Maybe, but even so... You were glad you came after me, right? I sure was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>So quit trying to puzzle out an answer. It's not like you're good at that kind of deep thinking anyway. Just do what you know is right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What's with you? It's not like you to hesitate to go where you know you're needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>If you're worried about the Guard, don't be! The other members will take care of things while you're gone, and if anything bad happens, I'll be around to deal with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I've been helping Envylia get back on its feet, so I can easily watch over things until you get back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Are you sure? I can't ask you to do that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It's fine! I owe you one, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Remember when I wasn't sure if it was okay for me to step down as captain in order to help with the restoration efforts? You told me that I should follow my heart, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>The Holy Guard had more or less sorted itself out, but the world was still far from being on its feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Even so, the people of this world were fighting to survive with everything they had. All I wanted to do was help them, however I could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>To do that, I needed to see what they were going through in each nation with my own eyes—to be right there beside them. But though this was something I'd need to do to help Wadatsumi recover, I knew I wouldn't have the freedom to travel like that as captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I was at my wits end when you told me that if I was going to regret not having done it, I should just go ahead and do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I give great advice, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Not that I needed it. I already knew what I was going to do long before you told me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Still, your words gave me the final push I needed to actually make my decision final. So I'm grateful to you. Just a little bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Kagura...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Anyway, there's only one thing I have to say to you: If you're going to regret not going, then you should just up and go already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Ohh... I see. So that's why. It all makes sense now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What're you talking about? And why're you looking at me all misty-eyed?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Oh, no reason. I was just thinking that I get why you're in such a rush now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I told you, I'm not! And I don't like what you're implying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I just feel like I dumped everything on Kagura's shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I want to see these Taurus defeated as soon as possible so I can get back to Envylia and relieve Kagura. That's all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>That sounds like the definition of being in a hurry to me, Bud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Well, frankly, the sooner we defeat these creatures, the better. People's lives are at stake here. Let's just hope this goes well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Crap... We've got company again. Where are they all coming from?! And how many of these Taurus are we going to have to defeat before we reach the big one?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Well, at least we've confirmed that Taurus activity is definitely increasing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>C'mon! Let's just send this lot flying so we can keep moving!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Hey! Bud! Don't charge in alone! Geez...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>And...he's gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Still, we're pretty outnumbered. We really should've brought Judith with us, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Maybe, but she's a citizen—one of the people I am bound to protect. She doesn't need to be dragged into this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Yeah, but we could really use her Mecha Weapon right about—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Did somebody call for a genius inventor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>That voice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Huzzaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>J-Judith?! What in the world?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Let's save the catch-up for after we've beat these guys into the ground, yeah?</td>
</tr>
