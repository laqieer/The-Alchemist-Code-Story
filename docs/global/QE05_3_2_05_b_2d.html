<td>Tch! We're wasting time! Retreat!</td>

<td>Thank you. Who knows what would have happened had you not been here.</td>

<td>Well, it's our job to protect this caravan. Who were they, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gluttony Soldier</td>
<td>They must be the bandits that've been active in these parts lately. There's been a big rise in these sorts of bandit activities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>I see.</td>

<td>We definitely owe you our thanks. Here, take this with you.</td>

<td>It's a travel pass for this country. Normally it takes a long and arduous process for one of these to be issued, but these are extreme times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gluttony Soldier</td>
<td>Reliable merchants can be issued one of these at the discretion of the local commanding officer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>That would definitely be helpful! We were just wondering how we could secure a trade route within Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gluttony Soldier</td>
<td>That would be a help to us as well. We are in desperate need of supplies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Well, that was easier than expected.</td>

<td>It's natural for those in need to want to find allies—especially those that would be of benefit to them.</td>

<td>Do you think those attackers were really bandits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/logi.png" alt="Logi" height="128"><br>Logi</td>
<td>They seemed very efficient, and they knew exactly when to retreat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/logi.png" alt="Logi" height="128"><br>Logi</td>
<td>They moved like very well-trained knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>They must be the rebel forces that Marie mentioned.</td>

<tr>

<td>It's standard procedure for a small army to disrupt supply routes when they're fighting against a large force.</td>

<td>What?! Was it really wise of us to fight against them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>It would have been far more unwise of us to face the Gluttony army back there. We'd be wanted criminals right about now.</td>

<td>Well, that's true, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>You, there. I want you to take these supplies to a nearby village. If it seems possible to sell, then do so. If not—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fruit Peddler</td>
<td>Hand them out for free so they owe us a favor, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>This should be fine. From here, we will cross the southern mountain range.</td>

<td>Our destination is just ahead of that.</td>
