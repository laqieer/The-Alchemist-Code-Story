<td>These caravan guards are stronger than I thought!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Tch! We're wasting time! Retreat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Looks like the damage was kept to a minimum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Thank you. Who knows what would have happened had you not been here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well, it's our job to protect this caravan. Who were they, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>They must be the bandits that've been active in these parts lately. There's been a big rise in these sorts of bandit activities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We definitely owe you our thanks. Here, take this with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's a travel pass for this country. Normally it takes a long and arduous process for one of these to be issued, but these are extreme times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Reliable merchants can be issued one of these at the discretion of the local commanding officer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That would definitely be helpful! We were just wondering how we could secure a trade route within Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That would be a help to us as well. We are in desperate need of supplies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, that was easier than expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's natural for those in need to want to find allies—especially those that would be of benefit to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Do you think those attackers were really bandits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>They seemed very efficient, and they knew exactly when to retreat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>They moved like very well-trained knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>They must be the rebel forces that Marie mentioned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's standard procedure for a small army to disrupt supply routes when they're fighting against a large force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What?! Was it really wise of us to fight against them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It would have been far more unwise of us to face the Gluttony army back there. We'd be wanted criminals right about now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well, that's true, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You, there. I want you to take these supplies to a nearby village. If it seems possible to sell, then do so. If not—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hand them out for free so they owe us a favor, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This should be fine. From here, we will cross the southern mountain range.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Our destination is just ahead of that.</td>
