<td>Save her...Tina. It's all my fault Tamis is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Mocca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm so powerless in the end. Tamis had to go and fight the ancient dragon with her Wind Matter still dormant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How is it that I'm so weak? How long will I continue to be useless?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(Such a delicate body...and yet she's been supporting us all this time...and continued to encourage us, no matter the circumstances.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Mocca...I'm sorry. I've been by your side for so long, yet I never truly understood you. I'm finally wide awake now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'll repeat the same words you said to me! I'm proud to call you my friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If you don't have any faith in yourself, then..then put your faith in me! I'm never going to leave your side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ouija and alchemy are powered by the same source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>In that case...I won't just rely on my wind power. I'm going to pour every fiber of my being into this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Eh? I can see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, Moc... Sis? Is that you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Tamis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Your eyes! They're beautiful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Tamis! But...how come you're safe?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It was all Tina. She restored the Wind Matter to its original state! Sis...I've missed you so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Mocca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Tina, thank you... Thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We're not losing anyone else. No one's going to take you away from us, Tamis. Let's put an end to this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Time to right our wrongs...and ensure we never repeat our mistakes again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We're going to confront nature head-on for the right to all live in this land together; the right to kindle warm fires, nurture the earth, be surrounded by pristine waters, and live free like the wind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I will take you all up with a gust of my wind! It'll whisk you across the sky and set you on top of the dragon's back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You can do that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yep, and now that I have the Wind Matter fully restored...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm no longer the only Wind Shaman who can't use Ouija!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This isn't a power I've gained on my own... It's a power that was created by everyone combined, for the sake of protecting Saga. I'm going to use it to keep the future burning brightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And I will see the return of the peace we've had for eons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I finally get it! The reason I was blessed with the gift of foresight...is so I can spot a bleak future from a mile away and then change it for the better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No matter how many times I'm knocked down, I'm going to get right back up! I'll use my gifts to pave the way for an even brighter future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I can't believe it! I didn't know wind could do this! We're really flying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Right? Right?! I'm totally amped!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's completely different from flying on Broom Ace! What a rush!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Tamis, are you sure this isn't going to harm your body? If the Wind Matter is stored inside you, then wouldn't using Ouija—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm fine. Using Ouija won't affect my body or the Matter in any way. Think about it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I've been given the power of the Sprite Trio's Matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The Matter were originally a means of restraining the dragon. Ouija, charged with tending to Matter, are a tremendous threat to the dragon, you see. Watch this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>O wind, tear it to shreds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wow. It tore the tentacle to pieces!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It's because I have the power of all four Matters! Let's head inside and finish this already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We can finally put an end to this chapter. Alia... Voda... Fuu... Tehre... Georgios...your sacrifices and those of our ancestors, spanning over a hundred years, will at last bear fruit today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The Saga you desperately wanted to protect, father...I will do so in your stead, right here and now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I—No. We will be the ones to put an end to all of this!</td>
</tr>
