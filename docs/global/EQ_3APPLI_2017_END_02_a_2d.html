<td>Why are they fighting here? You're all here to disrupt the Twilight Zone, aren't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I need to fix this myself. I can't afford to let them exploit the power of the sun and the moon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That's not why we're here! Please, believe us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm not so naiveÂ as to be deceived by your words!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I am the only one that can protect the Sun Keys, so I need to be careful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Amaterasu's distrust has increased. Could this be...the influence of the darkness?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This must be the negative energy that Amaterasu was talking about...the one strong enough to disable the power of the sun protecting the Twilight Zone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hehe... I see a vulnerable opening in your heart. Now then...time to make it even wider...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'll use my very own Uzushiomaru. It enters the corners of your heart and spreads its negative energy, dominating everything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Then, the opening in your heart will create a divide between what you desire and what you see before you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...Ah! You four made it here before me, but I won't hand the Sun Keys to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh?! What are you talking about?! We're not here because we want the Sun Keys...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hah! It'll take more than that to deceive me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You act caring, but as soon as she lowers her guard you intend to take the keys, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Honestly. Your kind are the most devious! Well, it's not like anyone would fall for your scheme.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ex-exactly! There's no way I would fall for it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I mean, as if I could trust anybody!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Kayako is trying to lower our credibility...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But this will only make Amaterasu see Kayako as an enemy as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Listen to what we're telling you, Amaterasu! We were friends sailing together on a pirate ship, we went on adventures together...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Stop speaking nonsense! I'm busy with managing the sun! Why would I go on an adventure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>For starters, I could never make friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes...exactly, Amaterasu! You will always be a lonely, isolated sun...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes...I'm fine with that! Who are you to tell me otherwise?! I don't mind being alone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes, that's the spirit! That's exactly the kind of opening I can exploit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>By voicing the opposite of what lies in your heart it causes the tear to widen further!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>All right then, Uzushiomaru...enter every corner of Amaterasu's heart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Gwooarhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No...! Something is penetrating my heart...! Nooooo?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Amaterasu! Stay strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Could this be the same thing as the nightmare we had? It attacks the heart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If that's the case...then it's not good. Amaterasu doesn't have friends she can trust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hahaha, exactly! It's about time I used my curse Uzushiomaru to take over her unstable body...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Come now, Uzushiomaru...no, Amaterasu! Use your power to get rid of these bothersome foes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ahhh...aaaaaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What the...?! There's a black mist pouring out of Amaterasu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>There's a strange creature emerging from Amaterasu...?! Is this also the fault of Kayako's curse?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ack! Amaterasu! If only there was some way we could convince her to believe us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We'll try to buy you time, so think of another way. Captain, you can do that, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Captain, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>All right! I'll do everything I can to find a way...all of you, be careful!</td>
</tr>
