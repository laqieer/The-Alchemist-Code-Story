</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What?! Are you serious?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This is a token that links one to the Shadow Messiah. You should be the one to give it to her, Ila. Stay together from now on.</td>

<td>Lord...Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Mia, you may not be an official member of Shadow Messiah...</td>

<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Zehn, I leave them in your care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Understood. After all, I still do not see any limit to your darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It will take some time for me to honor my end of our bargain, but I will do so without fail. In time, I will show you the way to the truth.</td>

<td>Letitia... They're strong, but will they become a force to be reckoned with?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(Hahaha, isn't that obvious? They are the same as you; people who have gathered as one, eager for a new world.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>This is true... You are right, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>My Shadow Messiah comrades beyond the grave! Gather the Dark Soul Shards and obey me once more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Whatever the means, we must accomplish this deepest desire of mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I shall not cease. This is my path—now and always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>The trial that awaits you all may not be an easy one, but I wish you the best of luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Eeeeek!!! Captain Vettel is so cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Well then, I'll now explain the final trial to you! The trial will be held at the Trial Ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>There is only one condition for passing! You must fetch a Philosopher's Stone from the ruins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The roots of many a Paladin can be traced back here! Follow in the footsteps of your predecessors! Step through the door to becoming a glorious Paladin!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Ca-Cadanova? The Guardian of the Land...? The Flame Dragon King?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>He's a shining star the likes of which every knight—no, every living soul—in Babel has heard of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>H-hey... Isn't this—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>A huge opportunity for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh? Opportunity...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Even though I'm in the 13th Rank, if I impress Captain Cadanova, he might initiate me into the 4th Regiment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ohh... I'm getting my hopes up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Come, Vettel... I await you here. You and your aspiring knights of the future... I will crush you all before you have the chance to become the leaders of this corrupt world.</td>
