<td>Why are you following me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Listen! It's too dangerous to go alone. I was worried!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm not weak! You don't have to worry about me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And what're you trying to say? You think that I'm not strong, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I didn't say that! But...I can't just leave you alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I don't know... You're always trying to take off on your own... That kind of worries me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Shut it. You don't know the first thing about me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They took everything from me. My family. My home... Everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I understand. I went through the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My home is gone. My Papa, my Mama... Besides my big sister, everyone was killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>When I got the news, I flew home from boarding school. But by then, I had no home to go back to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>O-oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I could only stand before the burned remnants of my home and cry. I couldn't even tell if I was angry, sad, or lonely...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Something deep inside of me was set aflame, but even I don't know exactly what it was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>They say it was Alchemia that got out of control. Even though I understood that, I couldn't stop myself. I was so frightened I cried even more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And then my big sister came and held me close. She told me that it would be all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>"You're not alone, Silma." "I'll be here for you. It'll be okay." She told me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If I was angry or sad or lonely, my big sister would take care of it. It must have been painful for her, too, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Because she was there for me, I knew that I wasn't alone. She saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ila, you remind me of me from back then. So I just can't leave you like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I don't want to leave you alone. You've got friends that care. So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You don't want to leave me alone? What do I care? I never asked you to do that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm fine alone! Don't go forcing me to be friends with you! I don't need anyone else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ila!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(Ugh! She makes me so furious!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(What's the point of friends? Only weaklings gather friends around them. If I did that, I'd become a weakling, too.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(And you can't trust weaklings. When things go wrong, they'll betray you. That's right, I saw horrible things in the back alleys...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(When the going got tough, the weaklings would throw the weakest and the slowest to the dogs to save themselves.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(The friends you shared a meal with yesterday will pretend they don't see you get kidnapped. No one will bother to save you.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(You can't trust friends. I became stronger so I never have to rely on anyone else.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Right. I'm not weak. I'm strong! So this is a mission I can handle on my own. I'll prove it to Corvus!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>So this is the place that guy was talking about. The hideout full of people that hold a grudge against the Shadow Messiah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hey, you! What do you think you're doing over there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh, it's just some kid. What are you doing in a place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hm? Wait... You're the brat that was with the Shadow Messiah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We could use you to get revenge if we captured you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hmph! You think you can take me? Just try it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Uck... What a pain! Hey, everyone! Over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It doesn't matter how many of you weaklings there are. I won't lose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But there are way too many of them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Gya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Tadah! It's me, Silma!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Silma? Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ugh! Damn! She brought a friend?! Let's round 'em up and take them out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>We can talk later! Now's the time to attack, Ila!</td>
