<td>Is that all of 'em? Wooooooo! We did it!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Eek! My poor ears! Don't shout when you're this close!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Captain! We've successfully put out the fire! We also finished healing the injured!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We're not sure about the whereabouts of some of the Holy Order's investigation team, but there were no casualties amongst the villagers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I see. That's a relief...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Thank you, everyone! We'd be lost without the Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We can't take too much praise... Look at this place, it's been burned to the ground. How can we ask you to keep living in a place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It'll be difficult, but...what's most important is that we're all together. We'll figure something out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The Scarlet Flame Guard will provide whatever we can to help you rebuild.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hm. Guess I should keep an eye out for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, I guess we finally get to head back! I'm sure everyone's tired, so rest up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Phew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>My body feels like lead... I feel like I've been sleeping forever... What time is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Natalie said not to worry, but... I wonder if Captain Vettel is really going to be okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wait, Captain Vettel?! You're awake?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hn, yeah... Morning—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>E-everyone! Come quick! Captain Vettel is awake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...Hnn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Vettel's awake?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>H-huh?! What's wrong with you all?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Don't you 'what's wrong' with me, mister!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The second we got back to base you fell asleep, but it's been three days since then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>R-really?! No wonder I feel so well rested...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I knew you weren't in critical condition or anything like that, so I let it be for now, but Chloe was worried sick! She barely even left the room!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I told you that you were seriously overworking yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This is exactly why I told you to take a break! If you'd taken a break like I told you to, it would've never gotten this bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Exactly! You gotta get some sleep BEFORE you pass out for three days!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>S-sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Stop trying to carry all of our responsibilities by yourself, and put yourself first for once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I know you care about all of us, but we care about you too, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>She's right, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(I thought I had things under control, but look at how much I worried everyone... I still have a lot to learn.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm sorry for worrying you all, but I promise I'll do better this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...And if I ever do anything irresponsible enough to end up in that place again, well, I know he'll set me straight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>He? Who are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ah, it's nothing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...Um!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...I... I'm so sorry. I'm still not strong enough to be of help to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Victor...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I know I'm still lacking in many ways! But...I really want to support you however I can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I look up to you so much! I want to become a knight just like you, just watch and wait, so that's why—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I'd say his heart is in the right place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ren?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Victor has spent all this time looking at his comrades and wondering what he can do to help them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Besides, he managed to not just protect the village, but even fight in your stead in that final battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Don't you think he's grown strong enough to carry some of that burden of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>He even suggested that everybody try and do some of your work while you were snoring away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>All in order to lighten your load a little when you woke up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>He did? Thank you, Victor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>If that's true, I suppose I could give you a bit more responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>D-does that mean—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's right. Congrats, Victor. I'm promoting you to Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Y-you can't just say such a thing out of nowhere! M-me? Captain?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Do you have any objections?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>No, no, no! Not at all! I'm just a little surprised!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It'll be a lot of responsibility, Victor. Prepare yourself, because I'm going to be stricter on you than ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Well, then I'll play good cop. I'll help you out here and there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Victor! Let's do our best together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Whoa, what! No way! I can't believe I made it to captain! Heheh... Nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hold on! This isn't happening right away, right? Vettel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Haha, of course. I've still got some life left in me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I will continue to do my best for all of you. Promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>(Happy now, Gerald?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...And that concludes my report on the matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I see... How unfortunate. I had hoped to learn more about these ruins, but if they have been burned down...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Yes... But I'm happy to report the villagers made it out unharmed. It is a small mercy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>A silver lining in this dark cloud indeed. I must also extend my gratitude to you for keeping the members of our expedition safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Ah, before I forget. You mentioned you were concerned that some of our members were unaccounted for after the battle. I'm happy to report that they simply ran back to report here when things got a bit too heated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>They are all safe and sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Really? What a relief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>There's a chance something like this will happen again next time a ruin is excavated in Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Therefore the Scarlet Flame Guard plans to compile what we have learned about our opponents and the battle strategies we made use of, and share it with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>That's a wonderful plan, and I certainly won't say no to that offer. But don't the knights have enough on their plate already? Wouldn't this be yet another burden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Researching and recording this kind of thing may attract bad people your way, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Are you sure you want to do this? The Holy Order is willing to take on this task in your place if needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You're right... This would be terribly hard to do alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Luckily for me, thanks to all my comrades: I'm not.</td>
</tr>
