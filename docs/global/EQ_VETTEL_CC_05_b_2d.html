</tr>
<tr>

<td>Therefore the Scarlet Flame Guard plans to compile what we have learned about our opponents and the battle strategies we made use of, and share it with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Cleric</td>
<td>That's a wonderful plan, and I certainly won't say no to that offer. But don't the knights have enough on their plate already? Wouldn't this be yet another burden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Cleric</td>
<td>Researching and recording this kind of thing may attract bad people your way, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Cleric</td>
<td>Are you sure you want to do this? The Holy Order is willing to take on this task in your place if needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vett.png" alt="Vettel" height="128"><br>Vettel</td>
<td>You're right... This would be terribly hard to do alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vett.png" alt="Vettel" height="128"><br>Vettel</td>
<td>Luckily for me, thanks to all my comrades: I'm not.</td>
