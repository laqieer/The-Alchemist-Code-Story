<td>I want to make this world a place where everyone can love each other.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>If one side were to be killed off, that wouldn't be possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No one should be sacrificed. If someone were to protect someone, then that person should protect someone else...and on and on—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We could all live together like that. That's the kind of world I want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's why I want to do something about Asmodeus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I want you to listen to each other and stop this fighting! It's only leading to casualties!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hah...hahahah! That's quite the dream, Lisbeth.</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Your dream is warm and fuzzy...and empty.</td>

<td>For the last 200 years that I have been queen, not once has this country been under threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's how impenetrable the love for my people is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I love all the men and women in my country for the different purposes they serve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's why I can protect all of you whole heartedly! The way I love my people is different from other rulers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Isn't that a little twisted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You make it sound like all your subjects are possessions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Of course, they are. I am the queen, so I own and love all my people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's been historically proven that rulers who loved their people too much are eventually destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hm...destroyed? That's reserved for the destroyer herself to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The destroyer, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>However, this country will not be destroyed! Like the spirits gathered here, it will continue to live on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You should let them sleep now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Your subjects were born in this land, ate from this land, and will sleep in this land before being reborn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Dust for dust. Your distorted ways should be remedied. In fact, you are the distortion and you should be remedied.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You are the Corpse that refuses to die. How dare you speak of such things to me!</td>
