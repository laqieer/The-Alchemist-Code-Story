<td>Where is everyone?</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>And who might you be looking for?</td>

<td>Who's there?!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I am Waginau—one who knows much about all of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>All of us? I don't understand what you're talking about, but if there's something you want to ask then hurry up. You're being highly inefficient right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Heheh. That's quite the tone to take with someone you've just met. I'm not very impressed by your attitude, Seida.</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Who are you...? How do you know my name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hahaha! Fate is on our side, after all! Who would've thought you would make your way to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's saved me the trouble of going out to find you! Well then, how about you tell me...where the Sacred Stone is?</td>

<td>014</td>
<td>...?! How did you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Heheh. I was told so...by the very people who planned it!</td>

<td>N-no, it can't be...!</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I can't feel anyone's presence anymore... I felt them just a moment ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>At first, I attempted to prise the information from them gently, but their attitude was much like yours, and so I had to punish them a little.</td>

<tr>

<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Heheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Noooooo!!!</td>

<td>They were quite noble. They didn't give up the location of the Sacred Stone, even until the very end. That's why I'm going to ask you now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Where is the Sacred Stone? If you won't answer, then you'll also...</td>

<td>Oh, he ran away!</td>
