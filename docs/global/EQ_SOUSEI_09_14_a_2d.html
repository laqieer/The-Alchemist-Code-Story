<td>Hyaaahh!!!</td>

<td>Your attacks are stronger and quicker than last time! Before, they were so small and tentative. But there's more to it than even that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Adjusting for interference via Space-Time Manipulation... Accelerating the right arm. Freezing time for the left leg. Materialized a foothold to your rear! Keep it up; you're doing great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Got it! Thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hmm. Using such techniques to augment your physical attacks is a good way to bolster your strength against single opponents, indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>And you've got numbers on your side, to boot! How fun! It seems I won't have to hold back at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So, how long do you think you can last? Your body can't handle being enhanced in such a manner forever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I can keep going...for as long as I need to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I am the Shield Maiden of the Invidia Belt! This is my sworn duty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I cannot abandon those I am meant to protect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You've got spirit, to be sure! But spirit can only take you so far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Nggh. This is...little more than a war of attrition at this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(She's weakened! Now's my chance!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wait, Daphne! We didn't plan for this! I don't have enough time to boost—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Don't get cocky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Curses! She blo—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Gaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I acknowledge your strength, little lady. Haha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'll admit, I was not prepared to expend so much energy on but a single battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Presumably Matia is dealing with a similarly difficult situation on her end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But the one thing I can't stand... The one thing I can never abide...is giving up before the struggle has truly ended. That will be your downfall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wh-why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Why are you...doing this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Need you even ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes. Because you, too, had the title of Shield Maiden...and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Now you're trying to...end mankind's future?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>There is someone I'm fighting for. No matter what may become of her, and no matter what horrible acts she may do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I must be there for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So... You've got your own motives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well, it's the same for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I have my own obligations to fulfill. There are people I've sworn to protect...no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So I must bring an end to this battle, here and now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Your king... He said that true power reveals itself when it's wielded to protect something. And he spoke those words of the knights of Envy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>There are people who believed in me from the very start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>As a knight of Invidia, I will lay my life on the line for peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I am Daphne, Shield Maiden of Sodom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes, that...applies to me as well, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Haha. But the future I fought for can no longer come to pass. So my shield no longer has a destiny to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>"We are the ones who embrace Envy..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Then I'll protect everyone with this shield. For both of us!</td>
</tr>
