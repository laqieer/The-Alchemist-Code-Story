<td>Adjusting for interference via Space-Time Manipulation... Accelerating the right arm. Freezing time for the left leg. Materialized a foothold to your rear! Keep it up; you're doing great!</td>

<td>Hmm. Using such techniques to augment your physical attacks is a good way to bolster your strength against single opponents, indeed.</td>
