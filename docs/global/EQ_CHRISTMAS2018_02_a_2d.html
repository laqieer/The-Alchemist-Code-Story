<td>Whew! Looks like we managed to scare them off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What's that weird face for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(Weird face?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>N-no reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You know something, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Eek! W-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So it isn't snowing where the Maruda Tribe lives, either?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's right! Snow is essential to the Maruda Tribe's Winter Holiday celebrations, too, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's why we're here. We came to see what's going on with the other countries, and to check out their Winter Holiday celebrations while we're at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Now you find that it's not snowing here in Slothstein, either?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's really weird. What could be causing this? What to do, what to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>At this rate, we won't be able to give the children of the Maruda Tribe the amazing Winter Holiday they deserve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hmmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Tell me something, Klima. Is the Winter Holiday really so wonderful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh? Well... I think so. It's an event for children, but I look forward to it every year, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I guess it's kind of like a festival? Everyone gets together to eat delicious food and celebrate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Not only that, but Santa Claus gives presents to the children who were good that year!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh, my! How interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You've never celebrated the Winter Holiday before, Birgitta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No. I was never able to experience such festivals as a child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Aren't you...still a child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh? You think I can receive presents from Santa even at my age? He must be an extremely generous man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh, you're back! What did you find?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Everywhere is the same! There is no snow falling anywhere you go. That's awfully strange, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's definitely weird, but we still have absolutely no idea about what's going on yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hmm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Birgitta? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I felt the flow of Alchemia. It appears as if someone is meddling with things in the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>In other words, someone's keeping it from snowing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If we follow the flow of Alchemia, we might just be able to find out who is responsible for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Umm... What's going on? The weather isn't really one of my specialties, so I'm a bit lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I know! Why don't you guys take care of that while we start getting everything ready for the Winter Holiday?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I guess we won't be having our hunt for Santa this year... How sad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That is indeed disappointing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Keep it together, you two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Very well. You may leave it to us. Let's get going, shall we? This way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>W-wait a minute! That's the way to the Maruda Tribe's village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The place where the guardians of the Winter Holiday live... I wonder what's going on over there?</td>
