<td>We've arrived! So this is where the treasure is buried!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Look at the ancient ruins here. I'm surprised that my network of information never picked up on this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wow. I guess there are some things that even you don't know, Vanekis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh, the range of my knowledge is really limited. After all, even though I researched the way to get here, I didn't know anything about those ancient ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I guess that's the way it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Heheh. Yes, that's the way it is. All right then, let's look for the treasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey...is that the treasure chest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Treasure chest?! Where? Where?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm gonna get there first. Well then, let's see what this treasure chest is all about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh! Vanekis, hold on! These kinds of treasure chests are usually booby-trapped!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Is this...poison fog?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Vanekis, don't move! I'll take care of it right away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh dear...I was so careless... I'm...sorry...Shenmei...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Vanekis? Vanekis?! No. She passed out...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I administered basic first aid, but I need to take her to a doctor immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That being said, I don't know how to get back home... Wh-what should I do? At this rate...please...someone help...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Mm...mmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh...Vanekis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ack! Collect yourself, Shenmei!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You're a captain! You need to protect the lives of your crew at all cost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Vanekis, try to endure for a bit...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hyaaahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Mm... Wh-where am I...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Vanekis! You're awake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Shenmei...what happened to your face? You're covered in wounds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Right...I got covered in that poisonous trap...and you carried me all the way to the town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You seem to have properly regained consciousness. You're gonna be okay! What a relief...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused, Shenmei. You saved my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Come on...I'm the one who should be apologizing. I put my crewmate in danger. I've still got a lot to learn before I start recruiting more crewmates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Who am I kidding; I'm still a kid. I'm not sure I'm worthy of being captain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I disagree. You did an incredible job in completing your duties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You saved your fellow crewmate. No matter what anyone says, you're the best captain in the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Thank you, Vanekis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You've got a nice smile. That kind of look suits you better. Be careful...I might just fall for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Fa-fall for me?! Well, we're both girls and, um, we should follow the necessary procedures!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Pst...ahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, you were kidding! Don't make those kinds of jokes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Sorry, Shenmei. You're so adorable, I can't help it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That being said, if you keep improving at this rate, I might really fall for you and join your crew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Whoa! I'm not forgetting that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>One day, I swear I'll make you join my crew, Vanekis!</td>
