<td>Huh? The professors aren't chasing after us.</td>

<td>Maybe they don't actually expect us to be heading to the headmistresses office.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I think they're waiting for us outside the school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If that's the case, it might be wise to try and convince the headmistress.</td>

<td>005</td>
<td>If they surround us outside the school, we've no way of escape.</td>

<td>Don't worry. I'm sure the headmistress will understand!</td>

<td>No way! What are you doing here?!</td>

<td>You want to remove the curse? No one would seek the Sacred Stone for such superficially noble reasons!</td>

<td>018</td>
<td>N-no, that's not true!</td>
