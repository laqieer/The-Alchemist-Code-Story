<td>001</td>
<td>And with that, the chores are done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's almost time for Benika to arrive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I never expected to be able to spend time with my sister like this again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There's no happier time for me than this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But what should I do now? Do I continue walking the same path as I did in the past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Relive the future where I lose Benika and this region and become the sole survivor once again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There is a chance I could save my sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That would mean betraying all the history that is to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>All the battles the world has seen up until now; the tomorrow that the people grasped for by enduring pain and suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Do I really intend to take that from them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huff...huff... Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Are you all right, Benika?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I can't...run anymore... Go on...without me, Yna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What should I do? I... I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What is troubling you, Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Master! Were you eavesdropping on me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No. I was just passing by. Although...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>As your teacher, I have one piece of advice for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Advice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You are too kind. Naive, even.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Listen closely, Yna. The moment you concern yourself with the fates of others is the moment you will no longer be able to save them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Know that no matter how strong you become, there's only so much you can protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That is why you must forget. Forget everything except what you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Do only what you feel you must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And believe that others are doing the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But, that is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That is all I wanted to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It is almost time for your sister to arrive. Go out and meet her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I must go meet with Lord Kubera. If you are finished with your tasks, you may do as you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Thank you, Master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>There is no need to thank me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Even my strict master is worried about me... I must seem rather desperate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What should I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>U-um...! Good afternoon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Scrah! Scrah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Good job getting here, Benika. Master is not here today, so there's no need for you to be so nerv—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Benika, who is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh, um, I found him passed out in town and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Nimul?! Why is he here, in this time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh, is he a friend of yours? That's great! Looks like it was a good idea to bring him here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's a serious wound. Sorry, Benika, but could you boil some water?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Y-yeah, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well then, let's treat your wounds first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Uh... Here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>So, you're awake, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Eh? Yna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>From how you're acting, it seems you are somehow the very Nimul I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Which means, you must also be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yes. the one who practiced techniques with you and went on a journey with you to defeat Cursed Beasts was me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I see. I'm relieved!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>But...aren't you a little...young to be my Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I was young in the first place...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Ow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>This wound... You fought Avaritian soldiers, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Yes, I was careless. The people of this region are strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It's a strength obtained by making a great many trade-offs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Their strength is the natural result of their stripping themselves of weakness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But more importantly, why are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Quence's Space-Time Manipulation. We failed at stopping him and were dragged into the ways of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>As to what happened after... Sorry, but I'm unsure of what happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>But never mind that now! Listen, Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>This region will be destroyed soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>What did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>The blade my master Roh Ku smithed, the Dragonslayer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>The battle between Mammon, and Lord Kubera, who obtained that blade, will lead to this region's destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>So you must leave here quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Dragonslayer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>First, we need weapons. Stronger, tougher blades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Start gathering soldiers ready for slaying a dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You heard him, soldiers! The time of our end, our final trial, is at hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>But they will be doomed if they do that! Kubera found the gear components needed to take down a Cursed Beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>We must hurry, Yna. To protect this region...we have to stop Kubera.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Wait, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What is it, Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>This is truly a rare opportunity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>There is no other chance to save the Avaritia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>However, that will change the past. It will negate the journey we will take hereafter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Is that all right with you? If that truly happens, will you truly be at peace with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Yna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I myself wanting to save my sister... My hometown...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>But I am afraid of what might happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>To fulfill my wish would mean I would have to sacrifice your futures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Yna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Still, I will save this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I have made many mistakes. And I will surely make more in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Life is a continuous chain of choices. One can never know if they made the right choice until it has already been made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>So, I have decided to do what I think is right at the current moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I've given up on worrying whether this is a path laid out by someone else, or what their intentions might be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I want to save all I hold dear. But if I save one person now, and because of that someone else is hurt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Then I will save them as well! I will do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>This ideal started as a dream between us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>In Sephira, at that workshop, we talked incessantly about the methodology of saving the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>The time to change reality is nigh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>So let's do it once again. Just the two of us, here and now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>We will save this region! We'll disrupt the order of the world as it was decided by the gods—and create a new world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>So, please... Help me, my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Ahhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>That voice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Benika?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Surely the quality of this gear cannot let me down...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Begone, human child. No matter how strong you may be, if your blade is cannot cut my flesh, it is meaningless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Damn you... Damn you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>My blade cannot pierce it?! So, this is a Cursed Beast... This is Mammon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Then we shall need stronger gear. Stronger components will be necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I will forge the kind of gear that I will only make once in my lifetime—gear strong enough to bring down a god.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>That day, I gained a purpose worth pouring my all into.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon, the pinnacle of all life in this region...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>That disgrace, that powerlessness... I will never forget it. I could never have foreseen that the work I've trained to perfection would be unable to pierce any living beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>How many nights have I spent in anticipation of killing that beast? But those nights are soon coming to an end as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Just a little longer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>My preparations are complete. I've poured all of my skill and fortitude into my technique.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Now, if only I could obtain the flesh and blood of a dragon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>S-sorry! I'm looking for my brother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>You are Yna's sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>I'm Benika. And you must be Master Roh Ku.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>He's changing the forge water. Now is not the time to interrupt him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Oh, yes, thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Skree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Wait for a moment, Benika.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Y-yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>That beast... Where did you find it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Huh? Oh... On this island.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>What?! It was right in front of my nose the whole time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Master Roh Ku?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Give that to me. We need the flesh and blood of that dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Huh? Oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Skree skree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>It is no mistake. It may be young, but this magil... It is, without a doubt, a dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Master Roh Ku, please stop! It didn't do anything wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Life itself is not a sin, of course. Sin is something we humans must bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Hate my mercilessness and your weakness, my child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>That feeling is what will make you stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Stop it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Perhaps I am growing senile. It was my fault for leaving an opening while we were conversing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>You saw it, too, Lord Kubera?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Are you certain that small beast is a dragon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Indeed. If we obtain its flesh and blood, my work will be completed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Gear powerful enough to cleave even sin. It must be completed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Then there is only one thing I must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Follow that girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Haaa...haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Ah... Ungh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Ah...eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>It's me, Benika. What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>B-brother...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Yna, who is this child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>She's my sister. Her body has always been frail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Skragh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>It's thanks to her carrying you that helped us reunite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Then I must repay my debt to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>They're coming, Yna. We're surrounded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Weaponsmith Yna, and you, foreigner from another land...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>We have been commanded to take that infant dragon. Hand it over quietly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>And if we do not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Of course we will take it by force, for that is the only law we follow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Nimul, lend me your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>I see. That's just what we wanted to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Allowing something to be seized by force, without even a struggle, just isn't our way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>If we cannot compromise, we fight!</td>
</tr>
