<td>Ah... Well, they're gone now. So the village has been completely invaded by the Royal Army...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>At this rate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Urgh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>W-wait! It's me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Teona? I thought you were with Isidore and the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh! Isidore asked me to stay behind and help you evacuate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The other two have already met up with the main body of the Liberation Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I see. That is a relief to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Kamui, where is Lord Waginau?</td>

<tr>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We should hurry and join the Liberation Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I have been concerned ever since I saw them retreat. They should avoid staying so close to the Royal Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What?! What are these strange monsters?! The same ones we saw at the altar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The Jam! This must be why the Liberation Army retreated!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Teona, be careful! Do not push yourself to fight them unless you must. If you touch them, they will imprint the curse upon you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>G-got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>B-but, then what should I do...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'll clear a path for you using my powers of purification. However, they won't hold long against a hoard like this, so you'll have to hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
