<td>Nice! You're really holding your own against Celis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But it's still not enough! What is it I'm missing?! It's just not quite coming together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I don't have time to waste here. I need to master Kagutsuchi now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You've already mastered the technique's form. The fact that you could land a hit on me at all is proof of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But then why does it still feel so unwieldy to me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Because there is indeed still something you're missing. I could tell while we were exchanging blows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Do you know what it is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The thing I'm missing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You said it yourself. You don't yet know what burden it is you're supposed to bear. In other words...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's because the everyday lives of yourself and those you wish to protect have so little overlap. This power, and the things it stands to defend, all still feel completely foreign to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see. Logi did say something to that effect earlier, but I'd thought nothing of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's not too surprising. You were brought to Wadatsumi very suddenly, and had a mass of information and expectation immediately thrust upon you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>And though your wish to protect this place is genuine, you don't know what it is you're protecting. It's this contradiction that dulls your blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But...then what am I supposed to do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Perhaps...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>There's only one thing you can do. One simple, yet utterly crucial thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Having lunch with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Uhh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Of course, it takes a fair bit of preparation for that! So you'll have to bear with me for a bit.</td>
