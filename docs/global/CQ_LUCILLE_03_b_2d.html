<td>Phew! Looks like that’s the last of them.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hey, Suiran. I have something I want to show you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wait! Hold on a sec! Look, I get it! You don't need to pull!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ohhhh! This... This is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's really pretty, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Watching the sunset from here is one of my favorite things to do. I usually prefer to keep it to myself, but I really wanted to show it to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's really, really beautiful.</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Suiran... What you said about making my weapons sad...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No one ever told me that it would be negligent if I didn't take care of my hands. I've been thinking about it a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Everyone has always said that I have to value my life more. That never made sense to me, but if it's related to my ability to continue making weapons... Then I think I finally get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What I’m trying to say is... You really opened my eyes. Your words have inspired something in me as beautiful and warm as the setting sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hehe, really? So that's why you wanted to bring me here, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I've also started thinking about what kind of feelings I want to put into my weapons when I make them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>One day, I'll show you the perfect weapon—one that is everything I have ever wanted it to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Sounds great! But just so you know, my weapons definitely won't lose to yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I wouldn't expect anything less! Speaking of which, I just had an amazing idea! I bet I can forge a really great weapon right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Let's hurry back so I can get smithing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Sure! I want to work on some stuff, too. I guess it's time for me to head back to my own workshop in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Thank you for everything, Lucia! I never thought I'd meet a blacksmith like you. I've learned a lot today. This has been great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Same here! I'm going to do my best to apply the things I learned from you today to my own blacksmithing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Glad to hear it! See you around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The weapon can sense the heart of the blacksmith, huh? Alright, so I’ve gotta gather all my feelings...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>And then, with my own hand, the most valuable tool of my trade, I just put them right into the heart of the weapon! Isn't that right, Suiran?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Just you wait! I'm going to make weapons as beautiful as the sunset we watched together!</td>
