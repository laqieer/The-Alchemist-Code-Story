<td>001</td>
<td>You might be a heartless bunch of cowards...but you're pretty capable fighters, I'll give you that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>And you're fast as lightning—but that ain't gonna cut it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Uh-oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>See, this is our turf; we've got the advantage here. Might wanna pick your fights more carefully next time, girlie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Here I come, Ishuna! Put those quick reflexes to good use and dodge this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Aaaaaarghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>A job well done, if I do say so myself. And thanks to your most effective distraction, not a single one of these miscreants escaped us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Your flighty footwork made you too tempting of a target for any of them to ignore. Excellent work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I-it's not like I was trying to be a diversion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If that was your plan from the start, I wish you'd let me in on it, but...I guess you did base it around my strengths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I appreciate that. Thanks, Icona.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Don't mention it. I just did what made logical sense and was most appropriate for the situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I... Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>After all, my machines wouldn't have been much help in this confined space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If I had been alone, I would have been in for a tough fight, but I knew I could count on your speed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You could say that this fight depended on our teamwork, and we each pulled off our allotted roles to perfection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Machines have much more specific capabilities than humans, so in order to make the most appropriate choice when thinking about what work to assign them, you really have to take efficiency into consideration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Are those kinds of choices really so important?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Do you have to ask? I would've thought you'd know the answer to that, having been part of a bandit group yourself. Such choices are especially important when you operate as a group, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't care what you have to do. No matter how uncouth or beastly you have to be... I want you to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You can hate me if you want. You can hate your chief if you want. Just promise me you won't rush through your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If the Unicorn Knights is where you belong, then you have to get back to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah... You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So then...I guess all that time I spent fighting so that we could stay together actually made sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The Unicorn Knights might have started with Captain Helza, but it came to mean so much to so many kids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Those kids needed you, and you didn't let them down. You did everything that was expected of you when they were left in your care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And everything you achieved for them was the result of your sound decisions, wouldn't you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yeah... I can see that now. Thank you, Icona. Really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You know, I'll never understand that impulse people seem to have to express gratitude over every little thing. There's really no need to thank me for my habit of analysis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>However, I suppose the polite thing to do would be to say "you're welcome" and be done with it, so... You're welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ahem. Right. As for you lot... You're going to pay for trying to rob people of their Winter Holiday joy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yeah, whatever. Can we skip the lecture? I'm really not in the mood. We were just trying to get back some of what was taken from us by those fat cats...not that you'll believe me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This was never about the baubles—not really. We were just trying to get back at that noble who's been hogging them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>He's kidnapped the craftspeople who make them and is working them to the bone, all so he can sell off the baubles to his rich friends at a premium!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>This year, only a select group of wealthy patrons will be getting those baubles, and that's plain unfair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That's why we decided to take matters into our own hands. Get back the baubles, rescue the craftspeople, and set things right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Those are the ones, I'm afraid. I was only able to order in a very small amount to begin with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Icona, do you think...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes. I daresay that merchant's reduced stock can be attributed to this noble's plot as well. Things are starting to add up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well, I won't let him get away with it! He's ruining the Winter Holiday for so many people! I can't imagine anything more selfish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Add to that the kidnapping and imprisonment... How low can you get?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Whoever's buying from him should be ashamed of themselves, too! Emptying their pockets for him instead of paying a fair price at the market... What's wrong with them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Actually, that's a fairly common economic practice, particularly among the wealthy. It's a bit of a gray area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>On the other hand, the kidnapping is very much socially unacceptable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Listen, we tried to break in already, but security around his mansion has been tightened tenfold! That's why we thought we'd take the peddler's clothes and sneak our way in...before you went and stopped us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ohh! So that's what you were trying to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yeah, that's right. It's our whole deal, if you must know. We never target honest folk. Only the rich and greedy who make their money dirty ever find our hands in their pockets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If you ask me, there's no point in celebrating the Winter Holiday if it's just the nobles who get to make merry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It's meant to be a day for children, ain't it? Used to be that only kids who were good all year 'round got any presents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I guess I misjudged you. You really were looking out for the common folk, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>W-well, I mean... I guess you could put it like that, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Anyway, down to business. I'm going to break into that mansion. That's my area of expertise, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Are you sure that's a good idea? While their story does seem to make sense, acting on it would mean placing quite a lot of trust in these...bandits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What if this is all some elaborate ruse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I guess it's possible they could be lying, but at this point we have no other leads. I'd rather go out on a limb and trust them than just give up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If there's even the slightest chance that this could keep the kids in town from being let down, then it's worth the risk. If I end up getting played for a fool, then so be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Hmm... I can't say I fully support this decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I figured. But...this is who I am. This is what drives me. I've always been this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Children's smiles mean that much to you, do they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Very well. I can't deny I'm intrigued. If you truly believe you can resolve this, then I won't try to talk you out of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Now that I think about it...you've come to my rescue several times now, even when you've disagreed with my opinion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Would you be willing to help me out again? With you watching my back, I'm even more confident that I can pull this off! Please? This isn't just for me—it's for everyone in town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I-I know it's a lot to ask, but...pretty please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I suppose this, too, is a valid choice in its own way. And here I was hoping to head back to my workshop before nightfall... Ah, well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>So then...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I still don't understand why you're willing to go to such lengths for other people, even when they haven't directly asked for your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>However, it's entirely logical for you to request my aid in this...so I won't say no. I'll do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Besides, on a personal level, I'm curious to see what sort of materials and tools these craftspeople employ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Yes! Okay, if you're on board, then let's get going. There's no time to waste!</td>
</tr>
