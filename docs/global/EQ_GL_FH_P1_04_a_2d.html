<td>Several days later, at the Slothstein city outskirts...</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...We made it. The care center.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Berith?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're not actually doing this, are you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I like a good fight, kid, but this isn't gonna end well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is all I can do now. Those orphans deserve more than Goetia's false promises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I have to try, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah, while the little queen's doorstep is just a stone's throw from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If the whole base comes down on us, I'll say it's your fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...Deal.</td>

<td>- Slothstein, Goetia Care Center -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ha ha! I gotcha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Eek! Don't tickle me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? Who's that over...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's Red Sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Did you come to play with us again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Where's the big sword! I wanna see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No, I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm here to bring you out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Out? Are we going on a trip?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But, the caretaker didn't say anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You can't stay here. It's dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Goetia will do bad things to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Umm... Are you okay, Red Sis? You're scaring me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The care center takes good care of us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Where can we go, anyway? Papa and Mama would want me to be safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But they'll... They'll make slaves of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Goetia will take all their kindness back once you're of age. We need to-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>... (She's right. Where will they go? I can't possibly look after all of these children.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh, hello, did our Queen send you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Does she require another status report so soon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No, I was...just here to visit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Take care, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Bye bye, Red Sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The caretaker whispers into a small device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>She's here. The Hound... She came to the care center. I don't know why.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>She was speaking with the children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>- Slothstein Alleys -</td>

<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Above the alleyway in a concealed nook, Roxanne watches the street level like a hawk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(The intelligence officer said she would likely choose the most deserted alleys.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>('The Hound', hmm? I wonder what she did to earn Goetia's ire so.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(Ah. Movement...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Red, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>A high-caliber round impacts the floor a mere pace from Red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Assassins... There!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Tch, she's spotted me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Roxanne attempts to run, but Red clears the nook in a single leap and tackles her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You-?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Have we met?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You're... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Sis... Sis killed you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Sis'?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Lilith. Godslayer. The... The bow-wielder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>She said she...personally put you down in the branch basements...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Wait, did you lose your memory?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Red. That sniper rifle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It's a living weapon of some kind. But it seems kinda... I dunno. Dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>She might be a host.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You're saying Goetia...is using her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You need to get out of here. They're feeding you lies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I don't know what you've done to earn Goetia's scorn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...But I have orders to kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Please, I don't want to fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>She's not gonna listen, Red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Come at us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Berith!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Ugh...!</td>
