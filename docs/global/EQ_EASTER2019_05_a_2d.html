<td>Arghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hrrghh! This isn't the last you'll see of us! Our dearest wish will be realized! We will rule this nation for—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>If you keep yapping, my sweet little babies might get grumpy and start chewing on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>N-no! F-fine... We will withdraw, so please, just leave us be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Phew... Well, at least the Imperial Easter Egg is safe and sound!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We'll deal with this lot, so why don't the rest of you meet us at the festival?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>All right. In that case, Teona, it's up to you to transport the egg and keep Neica safe. Think you can handle that for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Of course! You will come back with me, won't you, Neica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Y-yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So...this is the Imperial Easter Egg! All the other eggs I've seen have been cute, but this one is in a class all of its own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The coloring is impeccable and the design is so intricate... It's like a precious jewel! But I suppose that is why it is called the 'Imperial' Egg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You know... If you didn't want to come along, you should have said so when I asked you that question back there. Unless there's something else bothering you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>When we were fighting those guys back there, all I could think about was how happy everyone looked at the festival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I didn't know what to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Because I... I don't really mind people expecting things from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I just... I don't want to let anyone down. I'd hate myself. I'm terrified of disappointing people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But still, I... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I see. In that case, I say you should hold off on your decision until the very last moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It'll be all right! If it comes down to it, I'll even play the role of Neica for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'd never live up to the real thing, of course, but I'd do my very best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>T-Teona...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If you really can't do this, Neica, I am sure that anyone would gladly fulfill the role in your stead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Of course, no one could ever dream of playing the role better than you would simply by being yourself. You can rest assured of that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! It's that time you've all been waiting for! Keep your eyes peeled, because the Imperial Easter Egg is going to get even more enchanting than it already is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's almost time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Um... I-I... I'm going to do it. I'll go out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I don't want to disappoint anyone. I mean... All I have to do is be myself. It can't be that difficult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Very well. I'll be right here, cheering you on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>N-Neica! Are you all right?! You're not, like, hurt or anything, are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh? Why would I be hurt? Did something happen while we were gone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We saw those masked creeps briefly on our way back here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>They didn't seem like the types to just give up, so we hurried back, worried that they might have had something else up their sleeves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If they do... I suppose they'd consider the moment in which Neica casts her magic on the egg to be their very last chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>After all, they seemed to crave a sensational performance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Neica, we will protect you, no matter what. I know this must make things even more difficult for you, but do you think you could still manage to cast your magic on the egg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Y-yes. I'll go through with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Now it's time for the star of the show to reveal herself onstage! Give a warm round of applause for the one, the only—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hold it right there! That Imperial Easter Egg is ours, dammit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I hereby declare that this year's Easter will be a Festival of Resurrection for the fear that lingers in our hearts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ugh... Will you cut it out already? I had just worked myself up to the point where I could do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm not gonna let you stand in my way, and I'm not gonna let you ruin this festival!</td>
