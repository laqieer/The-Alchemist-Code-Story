<td>Oh?</td>

<td>005</td>
<td>Isn't that right, Gino?</td>

<td>I knew you were following us. I think I have a good idea as to why, too.</td>

<td>Eve seemed like she was having a good time, and I didn't want to ruin it for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So I kept quiet until we heard Moa crying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Jeez... Since when are you so concerned with women's moods?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You weren't always like this! You used to focus on training and honing yourself to perfection!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You wouldn't even let me anywhere near you, because you didn't want me breaking your concentration!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Sure, you were frightening, but you were also really freaking cool when you were all focused on perfecting your skills!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But look at you now! Fawning over a woman like some playboy... Did you forget what it means to be a knight?!</td>

<tr>

<td>Gino...!</td>

<tr>

<td>I get where you're coming from, Gino, but we still haven't seen any proof that Fraise has gone soft.</td>

<td>If you really think love has made Fraise weaker, then I say you'd better prove it.</td>

<td>018</td>
<td>Hmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is that okay with you, Fraise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I don't mind. We will abide by the honor code of knights and settle this fairly.</td>

<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Y-you don't mean that you two are going to duel, do you?! He's your brother! Can't you talk this out?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I think they just need to fight this one out of their system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You will apologize if I win, Gino.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Fine. Let's do this! I'm ready. I've done nothing but train while you were off prancing around with that woman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'll show you just how much stronger I am than you in that pathetic state! You'll get your damn proof!</td>
