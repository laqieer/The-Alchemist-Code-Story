<td>Hey, if you focus too much on that, it leaves you wide open...right here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hm, not a bad move...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But that's not all you've got, is it? You can do more, can't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If that's what you want... Miracle Kanon...Slash!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hm, interesting...but you lack control over your Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The training ends here. I pushed myself a little... How unlike me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But I understand now that you are indeed a very interesting girl... You pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ahh...hahhh.... Th-thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Kanon...? Kaya, what is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hm, I knew it was you who was looking for me, Zain. I was just training this promising recruit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I thought you might be interested in her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes, I think she should be trained thoroughly... It's not like me to say that, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Thank you for finding Kaya for me, Kanon. You can go back now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I want to talk with her alone for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Y-yes, sir! Goodbye, Lady Kaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Kanon is an interesting girl, isn't she? Now that I know that, I can step down from my position as Captain without any reservations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Why? You've always talked about it, but this time you went so far as to leave that careless letter...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>From now on, I want to start working full-time on what I've always wanted to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You'll be fine without me. It doesn't matter what you say, Zain. I'm not going back to the Holy Guard, or to my role as Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Kaya...the Holy Guard still needs your power! Or do you believe that I can't support you as Lord Commander?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's the opposite. Because you are the Lord Commander, I know that everything will be fine without me. After all, you've got some interesting recruits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Kaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This isn't like you. Zain, if you get all fired up like this, you'll wear yourself out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You don't need to act all tough. There's a limit to what you can do by yourself, even if you're determined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Then, please, stop this talk about leaving. The Holy Guard still needs you, Kaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Mm, you're always so stubborn at times like this. Even though what I want to do would benefit the entire world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Have you heard of the Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The Cursed Beasts... You mean the colossal beasts that existed in the distant past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes, but there are few even within the Holy Guard who know of their existence, and even fewer outside our ranks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>As I'm sure you know, I originally wanted to be an archeologist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Of course, but you have power; power that can help uphold justice in Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Those with power should make use of it...don't you agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmph, you don't understand women at all, do you? You're still a chivalrous, stubborn fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's why I stayed on as Captain of the 2nd Regiment until now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But we live in a relatively peaceful time, don't we? We are at peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I want to use history to reach the truth of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Heheh... I guess it doesn't make sense to someone like you, who has only ever had the Holy Guard in his sights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So I'll explain it in a way that's easy for you to understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Did you know that there's a blank in the history of the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>A blank?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The history of Babel begins with the year that the Holy Order was founded, marked as year zero, and we are presently in about the eight hundredth year...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Don't you think that's strange?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Why, even after eight hundred years, are you only the tenth Lord Commander?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I...! You're right! The numbers...don't match.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You probably didn't notice because you're always looking at what's right in front of you, but if you're interested, you can always go looking through the books in the library.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If you do, you're bound to notice a part of history that was omitted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>But you don't need to worry about that. You just keep progressing forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'll look backward in your stead, and seek out the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The right person for the right job. Do you understand? The true nature of the Holy Guard, and what truths this world is hiding...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>That is what I wish to learn and I am sure that knowing these things will benefit the Holy Guard as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>In that case, let me search with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What? Were you even listening? I'll search by myself, so you do what you need to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>As Lord Commander, I should know such things. I can't save the world if I'm ignorant of its truths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You really are a stubborn man... Fine, then you had best come and see for yourself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Where are we going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>To investigate this mural. There might be areas too dangerous for a lone researcher. I'd like to have you as my guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Of course... It ought to help me understand women better as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hm? Did you say something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>No, it's nothing. Come, let us go!</td>
</tr>
