<td>Hm...Huh? I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Kyahahaha! This is...good. A surprising result...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ooooh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No...you can't do that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ouch! No...Celliers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Uh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That doesn't match you, you know? Not at all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Mie...likki?? Oh, there's blood...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Celliers, you don't like going out, in fact, you were afraid...but kind and beautiful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But, but...I'm a monster. I was made this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's not true! It'll be okay...after all...Celliers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We became friends, didn't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There are a lot of things that I want to show you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The winter forests...the summer clouds...and, in the autumn, even more flowers bloom...and...and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>After the rain...a rainbow appears in the sky...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I would like you to see many, many things such as this village...the forest...so...so many things...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ah—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(How strongly those words reverberate in my chest? How many times have her words saved me?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Does she realize herself? When she says I'm sweet and smiles at me, it's her who's really sweeter than anything...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see... Thank you, Mielikki...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hohoh... So this the latest piece, Celliers! Why it's a stunning piece of crystal craftsmanship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Th-thank you. Um, I still have a long way to go, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Don't be so modest! In fact, I'm tempted to turn it into our town's specialty product!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>O-oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>All right, I'll go take it to some merchants and get their opinion on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What are you doing, Celliers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, I thought I would come up with a means to support myself, but just about the only thing I can do is make crystal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Mielikki, are you looking after your flowerbeds today as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes! Hey, hey, some new flowers bloomed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Celliers, come and look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yeah. I'll drop by next time. Oh, that's right. Here. This is a present for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wow! A crystal butterfly! Oh...but I thought you didn't like bugs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I've gotten a little more used to them. It's part of living in this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>People really do change after all. Recently, I feel it myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>All right then! Can you help me with my flowerbed?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Sorry, Mielikki. Butterflies are one thing...worms are still off the table for me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Right now there are a lot of them in the flowerbeds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But you said you could change, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I did, but I can't change everything right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Then when?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Umm, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hm? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Well, um...it's not a big deal, but there's a rainbow across the sky over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh, you're right! It's almost like your eyes, Celliers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...You think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yes! When your eyes are under the sun, they sparkle like that, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I see... A rainbow, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(I still don't know anything. I'm naive, weak, and still so unstable...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(But I'm sure that, one day...I can puff my chest up to my old friends.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Celliers! If you don't hurry I'm gonna leave you behind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yes. I'm going now, Mielikki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(Now, I feel like I can believe that.)</td>
