<td>Northern Pride. Headquarters of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Mistress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I recalled that I'd heard of the Vessel of Reincarnation before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What is that you're holding?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's a document that Lord Commander Zain entrust to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>There is unique information in here regarding the station of a Lord Commander and other information that must not be released to the public.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The Lord Commander's notes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Does it mention the Vessel of Reincarnation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes. The Vessel of Reincarnation concerns Nimul and Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The legendary siblings who created the Tower of Babel...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes. According to history, they were the founders of Alchemy...said to be closest to god.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's not public knowledge, but it has been said that every few hundreds of years their souls are reincarnated, thus returning to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Returning to this world...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The founders of Alchemy...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes. At least according to what Lord Commander Zain wrote here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Apparently, Nimul and Emmel will descend in a Vessel that contains a Sacred Stone within their body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>In that case...Lion Monarch Orion really is a Vessel of Reincarnation?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>At least he fits the criteria...that is if the legend is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, uh...what exactly happens when that reincarnation takes place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If the reincarnation occurs, the Tower of Babel will ascend to the heavens... They will transcend the gods...eventually bringing about the end of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's what's written here. I don't know anything beyond that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The...end of this world...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The Tower of Babel will ascend to the heavens...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's referring to that Babel Ruins in the center of Northern Pride, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I've heard that those ruins are the decayed form of the former Tower of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's why Orion's ultimate destination is Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>He wants to gather all the Sacred Stones throughout the world in order destroy its equilibrium. Then, he plans to make his long-awaited march here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I-in other words...if he reaches Greed Dike...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This world will end...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No...there's no guarantee that's the case. Think about it...their reincarnation only occurs once every few hundred years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If it was a certain thing, this world would've have been destroyed long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Right...but...what does it mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>According to the secret history written in this document...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>When Nimul's Vessel of Reincarnation appears, it has been said that Emmel's Vessel will appear at the same time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Emmel as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yes. Both Nimul and Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>One of the Alchemists will wield the Alchemy of Might and the other will wield the Alchemy of Compassion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The two forces will be like water and oil. They will slay each other and things will continue as they have always been.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>So Emmel will stop Nimul then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That means...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>There is a possibility that there is another individual in this world besides the Lion Monarch Orion who possesses a Sacred Stone within their body!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You're right...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The countries where the location of the Sacred Stone have not been made clear are Wratharis...and Slothstein...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Even if we were to search both countries for the Vessel of Reincarnation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I doubt we would find out anything in time for Greed Dike's assault, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Kazahaya, just in case, send envoys to both countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I will report all of this to the Emperor. Suzuka, I'll leave matters here to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The Lion Monarch Orion seeks to destroy the equilibrium of power in this world and, by doing so, obtain Nimul's power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It seems like this idea of his is more than a pipedream!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Meanwhile...in Saga region. The Serenea Prairie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>All of Saga is engulfed in a sinister atmosphere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Something doesn't feel right. Is the Matter in danger again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...Uck...ahh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...Ack... To-today is really a troublesome day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I never thought a day like this would come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You're that doctor...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Ye...yes... I...it's been a while...Se-Seida...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Are you hurt?! Hang in there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>N-no...it's nothing, really... M-my medicine would work...wonders on this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Please! Don't move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>M-more importantly...you should hurry on ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>At this rate...the w-water and w-wind factions will be destroyed...as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What happened to the earth and fire factions?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Th-they're on the brink of destruction...their lights just about to be...snuffed out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What happened to the Spites?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I-it seems their Matter was removed from their bodies. Their lives have been spared...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It appears your advice for them to be prepared...helped them escape the worst outcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Orion...how could he?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>U...uck... Th-that's not exactly...correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>How so...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>It...it was a man called Sol, all dressed in black, who attacked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Of the Templars...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I-I'm not really familiar...with the Templars you refer to, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>It appears that several of Gluttony Foss' armies were destroyed singlehandedly by that man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>In...in any case...y-you'd best hurry. That red-headed girl who's also from the Holy Guard appears to have been captured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Kagura?! Ack! Where is Sol right now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>He's either at the water or wind factions...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>The Beast Tamer Melda is...appears to be pursuing him, although...it might be too late now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>C-come...there's no time to waste. I-I'm going to have my hands full...looking after the...wounded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Alexis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...Sol!</td>
</tr>
