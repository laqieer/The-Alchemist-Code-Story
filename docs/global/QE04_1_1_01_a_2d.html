<td>...Mm...</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Where am I...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This is the Door of Truth—where souls are judged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Who...are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I am Ouroboros...the observer of destiny who bonds this world with truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I have heard the crying of your soul, wishing to change the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The future...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes...I saw the earth burning before my eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I have found you worthy of power. Do you wish for it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Power...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>When you hear the lament of both earth and life being defiled, you will receive the power to see the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The power to see the future...?! If that were possible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Would I be able to change that future of doom?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Your choices alone will determine whether or not the future will change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If that brightness that shines within your heart does not fade, you have more than a fighting chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Mother Nature in all her beauty and kindness cannot be engulfed in flames!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'll do whatever I can to prevent a future where all the colors of this gentle world turn red!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So, your answer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I want that power—that power to see into the future and protect the sacred nature of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Very well. Your contract of truth has been sealed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You have witnessed a terrible future, child. Let the brilliance of your soul guide you to the unwavering truth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...Mm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Where is Asena? Was that...a dream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No! It wasn't a dream! The place I found myself at, and the future I saw with my own eyes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I remember it all with every fiber of my body!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That young girl said it was the power to foresee the future...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It must be something that I...and I alone can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The wailing of the land and of life will soon subside! I will protect it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The village of Lezario. Mansion of Chief Adone of the Toxotes tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Adone, has Tina still not returned from the forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ehem. Not yet. I'm sure she'll return soon. Don't worry, Elder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's not what I'm worried about. I'm worried about whether or not Asena will accept her as your successor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>She has grown into a truly able warrior...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>With few youth in our tribe, she has become an integral presence within our community.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Whether or not she has the qualities to be chief is a crucial matter to this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Do you doubt my daughter Tina's qualities as a shaman?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I am just a little concerned. Despite her young age, she must carry the burden of our tribe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>There is no doubt in my mind that Tina has the qualities to become a shaman. That's what I believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>She might be...more qualified than I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>More than you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But only if she can open her eyes. Don't worry. I exercise no favoritism as her father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I understand your nervousness, but let's wait for now and see...ehem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We're under attack! We're under attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Chief, it's a raid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Ack! Is it the Bazura tribe?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No! Their battle flag appears to be a symbol of spread wings...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Spread wings...?! What is Gluttony Foss doing all the way in our forest?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Wasn't the Fuu faction supposed to be protecting the border?! Prepare my horse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wait, Adone! You mustn’t in your current shape...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I am still the chief of this tribe! If not me then who will protect our tribe of Toxotes?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'll leave the woman and children to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Adone...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Is that the power of foresight that the young girl gave to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...? Kiki, Adel...what's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...! Grrr...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Grrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Glur...glurppp!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Jam...?! Kiki, Adel, step back! Don't touch it! You'll get cursed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Oh spirits, residing within Mother Nature...hear my prayer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I am the one who shall become the wind shaman...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Ouija...give me the power to purify the evil that disrupts our harmony!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Gluuurp...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>That was the wind... My Ouija is truly shrouded in the wind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Grrrrr...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Is that smoke?! It can't be the village! Let's hurry, Kiki, Adel!</td>
