<td>I... I used to have someone I believed in. I was willing to risk all I had—that was how much I trusted them.</td>

<td>Someone I could entrust my darkness to, someone who made my blade stronger than ever... I saw the entire world through the prism of that person.</td>

<td>To have someone you trust can be a strength. With great resolve, you will resist the shadow's dark embrace. So whispers—</td>

<td>The darkness within you?</td>

<td>But this is our home and we can't let it be destroyed, so I feel lucky to have been summoned.</td>

<td>I want to protect Saga... The land that my mother, father, and grandfather grew up in!</td>

<td>I don't mean to force your hand or anything, but... Maybe you could see fighting for us as a means to protect and once again meet those you care about?</td>

<td>I'm sure Meliodas would feel the same way. I want to help those who need help, so that I have no regrets when we meet again. I must fight!</td>
