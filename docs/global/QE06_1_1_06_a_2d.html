<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Okay then, Amane. About your trial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You passed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh...? Whooooooooa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Welcome to the Blade Fox Corps, the demon slayers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Seriously?! But why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I passed, didn't I?! Why have I been thrown in the brigs?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yep. It's because you passed that you're in here. Keep it down, though. You're disturbing the other residents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What is going on?! D-did you... Did you bait me with promises of passing the trial just to do unspeakable things to me here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Uh, no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Tch! Don't think for a second that you can break me with torture! What do you even plan to accomplish through this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Can you please let me finish? You broke a Corps regulation. So now that you're officially accountable as a member, here you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A-am I supposed to be proud right now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>To be honest, I have no idea. I'm sure a life without joining the Corps could have been a happier one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But there is something about you. I do want to see if you really are the one who will bring peace to Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You'll be assigned with me in the Third Squad. I'm sure working with you will be a delight, Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>With you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm sure you have a lot to think about, so spend your time in the cell wisely. Later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There's a debriefing after every mission. Then, usually a party to show respect for those who were involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>A party?! Is Celis going to be cooking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah, and I am gonna partake to my heart's content. You, on the other hand, get to stay here and think over what you've done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Don't worry, I can bring you some scraps later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wait! No! This is cruel! How dare you enjoy a party after leaving me in here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm going to hold a grudge over this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You the only one here, Celis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I am. I heard Amane made it through the trial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Her naivete is pretty cute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I think so too. I just hope that doesn't get in her way on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'll be watching over her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh, really? That's not like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You seem quite infatuated with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh please. She's not my type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I thought I said we didn't need any new recruits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I won't let any trouble make it to the Second Squad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Having weaklings dilute the Corps is trouble enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ooh, so scary. Guess I'm no good for the Corps either, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You...! Must you always be soâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ugachi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Just to make things clear... I hate you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Well, that's not nice. I like you a lot, Ugachi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Why won't you just show your true nature already? Those like you who do not fight wholeheartedly have no right to stand among the Blade Fox.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh, you think too highly of me. When am I not doing my best?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I will force you to fight with all your might if I must.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You shouldn't. There will be blood, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Mine, probably.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Dammit, Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Enough! Stop fighting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>If you're losing your cool, I don't mind making sure you two find it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Tch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Why did I have to get hit too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>In a quarrel, both parties are to blame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Aw, really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>We do have our debriefing to get to. Can we please get on with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>All right then. I'll need a damage report. How many casualties per squad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>None for my squad. Oh! Except for one potential recruit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I see. That's regrettable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>It couldn't be helped. Fear got the best of them, and they turned their back on a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Understood. And the Second Squad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Only a few light injures. About that. There's something I want to ask you, Celis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The injured all reported the same thing; that it was Commander Celis that did them in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Have you anything to say about this, Celis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>No, I don't. Do you really think I would do such a thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>There's even precedent for plotting the murder of comrades, thanks to Jubei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Jubei was once your right-hand man. I wouldn't be surprised if you really were planning something behind our backs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ugachi! You can't be serious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Conflict or killing within the Corps, regardless of reason, is strictly prohibited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Being found guilty of breaking such a regulation is reason enough to be purged, and you are not exempt from that, Celis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Ugachi, you can't honestly be suspicious of Commander Celis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>It's fine, Tanosuke. I didn't do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Are there any that can corroborate that statement? We must be sure to investigate all suspects to do our due diligence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>All in the Corps are unsettled. They are jumping at their own shadows. Something must be done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>What if someone is trying to sow uncertainty among our ranks on purpose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>We've received reports of Hidden Ogre sightings from the castle town. You know what this means, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>A Hidden Ogre, one of the pure bloods... If this is true, we have ourselves a problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You aren't simply trying to divert the blame and evade liability for Jubei and yourself, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Not at all. I genuinely believe a demon is enacting a nefarious plan to sabotage our operations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Besides, Jubei has nothing to do with this. Why do you keep bringing him up? Concerned for your fellow student?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>That is irrelevant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>If the Hidden Ogre is in the castle town now, quarreling among ourselves is exactly what the demons want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>If you can find evidence of my treason, then I will gladly turn myself in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>I'm glad you understand the situation now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>I suppose that if you were the traitor, those injured wouldn't be alive now and there would be no evidence of any kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>I'll trust you for now. But know that I will have your head if you show any sign of betrayal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>That's only fair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Anyway, can't we get some reinforcements from Greed Dike?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Right now we're just eliminating demons as they pop up. At this rate, we'll just be aimlessly exhausting our troops. We need a decisive strike at the root of the issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>The continent's in a rather precarious state, so they don't seem to be able to send any.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I've heard the Scarlet Flame Guard of Envylia was purged. Could that have something to do with the current state of affairs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>It was only briefly mentioned during the scheduled meeting, so I didn't get to find out many details about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Celis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>The demons have consistently targeted us here at the Castle Aquila Rubrum, where we keep our base of operations. We have no idea why, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>If there is some logic behind the actions of these demons, we should be able to read their next move. Unfortunately...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>We have no idea what it is they want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Not a clue, huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>You mean that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Absolutely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>We'll leave it at that for now. Let me know as soon as you verify the validity of those Hidden Ogre sightings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Quite the temper, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>It just shows how much he earnestly cares for Wadatsumi. I find it to be reassuring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>And what shall we do about the Hidden Ogre?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Let's wait on what the scouts have to report. Though we still don't have the truth of what happened, we can at least comfort and reward the troops!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Three meals a day is the foundation of life! Strength of mind and body comes from a hearty meal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Everyone, repeat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Strength of mind and body comes from a hearty meal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Meals and blades are made to what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>To vanquish all demons who bring pain and suffering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>To bring about blissful days of joy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Now, all together...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>We give thanks for this meal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>We give thanks for this meal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>All right! Today I made meatballs! Enjoy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Oh no... Celis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Never again will I enjoy another meatball... These are the best meatballs I've ever had and ever will have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>You said something like that last time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>That's because you keep outdoing yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Aw, that's so sweet of you to say! Here, you get an extra one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Where is Ugachi, by the way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Mmmff-hhmmnn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Please don't eat with your mouth full. You don't have to rush. Your food won't run away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Mn... Gulp. Is it really necessary to hold a banquet like this every time we finish a mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Not to mention that little call-and-reply routine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>We never know when we might lose our lives on a mission. So it's important to eat, laugh, and enjoy life as best as we can, when we can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>We really don't know how long any of us have left in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>It's the Second Squad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Don't worry about them. I've shared your information about the Hidden Ogre sightings with them, just in case. However, some are still finding it difficult to trust you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Thank you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Oh no! The pot's already empty! I'll be right back with more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Hmph. She's an odd one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>She's just got a lot on her plate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>We all do, actually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Well, that's how she makes herself seem so suspicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Do you honestly doubt her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>No, but... She is keeping something from us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>I'm back! Hm? Hey, where's Azami, by the way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>She piled a load of meatballs on her plate and left. More importantly, give me some seconds already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Huh, I see. And fine, fine! Here you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Weren't you just accusing her of treason?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>That and this meal are two separate issues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>I'm not entirely sure when it started.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Echoes of memories, not of my own, started to flow through me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>They were always imbued with the strong urge to eliminate demons, with a strong hate towards them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>I saw hate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Whomever these memories belonged to must have had someone important taken from them...much like Azami had.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Then, in revenge, they take another important someone from somebody else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>I wonder if such a tragic cycle of events is still ongoing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Demons must be eradicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>"I still believe."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>"I still believe Wadatsumi will regain such peaceful days once more!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>That warm voice... As though he loves and pities all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Something I can't understand is happening within me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>There's no point dwelling on this, but...I just don't know what to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>If you can't even handle a demon like this one, you don't belong here. It's too late to regret anything once you're dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>You must live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>...!!! That's right! I don't have time to be wallowing in deep thought!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>I'm a member of the Blade Fox now. If there is anyone trapped in such a tragic cycle, then I will be the blade that cuts it down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>I must train, every day!</td>
</tr>
