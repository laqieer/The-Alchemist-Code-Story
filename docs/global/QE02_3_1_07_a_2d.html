<td>A mysterious man cut the train compartment in half? Are you saying that there was someone on the roof of the exploding compartment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yep. He told me not to ‘get involved any further.'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How should I know? In any case, he was one arrogant fellow—really got on my nerves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But...even if there was someone like that, I doubt he would survive that explosion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No. My instincts are telling me that he's doing just fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's some severe brain damage right there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh? Didn't you hear me? I said that I'm sure the man's just fine...</td>

<td>Then tell me what he looked like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>His face was...well...hooded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Seriously. I can't even laugh at your lies. What're you playing at?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Tsk! I was an idiot for even telling an idiot like you with zero imagination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's common knowledge that the Beckrams only employee the use of androids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I've never heard of them hiring humans before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If you're gonna lie, at least make it sound convincing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Shut up! Just shut up, Mr. Unbalanced!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
