<td>Siegfried and the party travelled to a small town near Greed Dike in search of more abandoned Alchemia research facilities.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Deep within a concealed laboratory, they confronted the mastermind Zheng Yi, a nobleman, and his head guard Asuka.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>In the heat of battle, a Core called Atropos, Alchemically enhanced Asuka and attempted to apprehend the party.</td>
</tr>

<td>The combined efforts of Minerva and Soren managed to temporarily disrupt and disable the Core,</td>

<td>Ugh...mmrgh...</td>

<td>Ow, my head...</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>As am I. Despite our close proximity, we were spared much of the damage, it seems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Whoa, Teach. You popped out from nowhere. At least you're okay...</td>

<td>An ethereal aura pulls itself away from Asuka and returns to the enormous Core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So that's what the Core meant by "conduit". It was channelling some form of enhancement through Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Indeed. It appears to be linked to its—or, indeed, all sophisticated Constructs'—ability to manipulate Alchemia particle levels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This could be extremely dangerous and volatile if not carefully controlled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Near the Core, Zheng Yi gets to his feet and notices the stream of Alchemia particles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>(Asuka... Rest, you have done enough)</td>
