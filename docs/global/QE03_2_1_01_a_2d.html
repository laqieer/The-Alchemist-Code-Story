<td>Yawn... With so many days off, it's starting to get boring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's understandable, after a terror attack like that. They still haven't finished repairing the school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But I can't get my hands on any interesting rumors when I'm cooped up like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>All I hear are a bunch of stupid rumors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Stupid rumors?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wow...it's Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're putting me off. If you have something to say then why don't you say it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Why don't you say how you're scared witless after hearing the stupid rumors that Liz used Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Someone said they heard you and the headmistress talking about Liz using the forbidden power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Then you must have also heard how I denied it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Rebecca...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I explained to the headmistress as well that there was a misunderstanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>As far as I can tell, Liz's power is nothing more than an eccentric form of magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>As far as you can tell? There's no basis for...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Are you saying that there is a student who has a deeper understanding of magic theory than me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Let's go, Liz, Alma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ah...um, yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Are you sure it's okay for one of the most popular girls in school to make enemies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Let them say what they want. They're nothing more than lackeys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Even if they turn against me, ultimately, money will have them flocking back with their tails between their legs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I want to become true friends with the two of you...whom I've fought side by side with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Rebecca...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh? And here I was thinking that we've been friends all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yeah, it's a little too late in the game for that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Alma...Liz...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>In that case...Liz, if you think of me as a true friend, then try not to hide things from me, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I agree... At least tell the two of us what you know, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmm...all right. I can't really believe it myself, but my power might really be—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...So it is after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Alma, didn't you say that Vermin were insects who'd evolved because of Philosopher's Stones?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>When I used this power to make the Vermin chrysalis evolve, I thought that might be the case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If it is...well, it means that there's no need to dispel everyone's misunderstanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Aren't you scared of me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Do you think I'd avoid you over something like this, Liz? That thought scares me even more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Alma...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>In that case, there's only one way to regain your trust, Lisbeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We need to let the other students know that Alchemy is not a dangerous thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Alchemy...is not a dangerous thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>At any rate, you saved us using Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That's why I can believe in you and your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>If only I could save all the others using this power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That's right. I was seeking this power so that everyone could co-exist together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Co-exist together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Both men and women, being able to live together as if it were the most natural thing. Right...I know what to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hey, where are you going?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'm going to ask the professors how to put an end to this country's curse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>If I can do that, then we can stop the fighting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Curse? You don't mean...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Sh-she was saying something pretty outrageous things, wasn't she? W-well...in some ways, she saved me the trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The trouble?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Our professor said that she wanted to have a meeting with Liz. She asked me to bring her to school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It sounded really fishy, so I was planning on not telling her about it, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Rebecca, that sounds pretty bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yes, yes. I know. I'm well aware that this so-called meeting is far from innocent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Let's chase after her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Oh! I wanted to ask you something, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I've been waiting for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Lisbeth Finn Lustburg...you will now be detained and taken to the Royal Palace of Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Most likely, you will be sentenced there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
