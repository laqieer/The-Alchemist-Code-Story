<td>What a relief. The queen isn't here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I wonder why they'd vacate the castle at a time like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Anyway, it's our chance. Let get to the roof from here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes! Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Liz?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Look at this photo...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This photo looks really old. Is that her mother next to her? Her face has been burnt off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Isn't this little girl the queen? Her eyes somehow seem similar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This is the throne room, so you're probably right. That means...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The person next to her is Mother?! We can't see her face though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's hard to imagine that a fire would just burn her face on the photo. Do you think the queen might have done it herself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>How could she do that to such an important photo like this?Â  It's a picture of her own mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>As the daughter of Mother, the queen must have had a hard life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>In fact, I'm surprised she could even become the queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Since her mother was hated throughout the country...I'm sure the queen was not treated well either...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Didn't the queen say before that she was the one who made sure that the witch of sin was taught to be called Mother at school?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>She turned her own mother's sin into a symbol to distance us from the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So that we wouldn't repeat the same sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Still...we need to get our hands on the Sacred Stone. If we don't take care of this, nothing will change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Agreed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We will not let you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You've stepped into the throne room over and over again... Are you prepared to pay the consequences?!</td>
