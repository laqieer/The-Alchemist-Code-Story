<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Of course, I'm okay! Don't get in my way!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I can handle opponents of this caliber without your help!</td>

<td>But the enemy is getting stronger and stronger, while our stamina is depleting. It would be safer if we fought together.</td>

<td>It's not about that. I'm in the same position as you.</td>

<td>008</td>
<td>Huh?</td>

<td>Yes, it was.</td>

<td>What do you mean? You're talking as if you were there to witness it.</td>
