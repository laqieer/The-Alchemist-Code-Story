<td>Who exactly is chasing Captain Kudan? You really don't know, Kagura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No, I don't. Only Kudan saw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Mostly likely, the sinister vibe I've been feeling is coming from whoever was there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Look! Someone's coming this way!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh...Melda?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Is it someone you know, Almira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>She's a Beast Tamer that often hunts around here. We're not exactly friends, but she's famous around these parts. She's so good at hunting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So this girl is the Beast Tamer, huh? I've heard of her before as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well, I'm sure you have, Seida of the Alize people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You know about me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Of course, I do. Your tribe and mine have traded from before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wow! I didn't know you were friends with someone famous like Melda! You never cease to impress me, teacher!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm not friends with her. Is there something you want? We're in a hurry, so try to be efficient with your request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Heh. Right. Let's finish this efficiently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hey?! What are you playing at? Why are you pointing your weapon at us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Forgive me. In order to fulfill my long-cherished wish, you're all are gonna have to pay the price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What are you saying? Please explain yourself properly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes! Calm down; let's talk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There's no way we can talk. I've become a beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I am a beast. A beast with neither reason nor emotions. My only job is to hunt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>He-hey?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>She's acting strangely. There's obviously something wrong with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes. There is no life in her eyes. It looks like she's under some kind of spell. Let's shock her and bring her back to reality.</td>
