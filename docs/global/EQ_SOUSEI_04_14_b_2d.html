<td>For Beelzebub to be betrayed by his own priestess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>People...are such baffling creatures...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It is for that reason the future is packed with limitless potential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What are you on about? You will come to regret this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Of the pillars tied to this world, three have failed in their duty. It is too late to escape from its collapse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Its collapse...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Look to the sky... You will see the answer to your question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What? It just disappeared! Does this mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It must. Nimul must have...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Jeez, that dolt likes to take his time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We've...done it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Commander, is this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes! Nimul has defeated Beelzebub!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Let's confirm our losses and get started purifying the area around the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's from now that the real work starts! It will be no laughing matter to restore these lands that the Cursed Beasts have rampaged through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hmm? What is it? Are the injuries that grave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No, sir. It's not that. It's... Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Stop being so vague. How many times have I told you, you must keep your reports accurate and concise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Um, I'm sorry, it's just...the sky...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The...sky?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What is that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>She's fine. She just needs rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I...see. What a relief. Truly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's all thanks to you, Julia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You're such a hopeless man...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That may be so. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm glad to see you again. It might be selfish, but that's how I truly feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Do you think everything is fine now just because you've gained a little self-awareness? Seriously...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>This has forced me to remember all of the suffering of the woman I once was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But...that really has nothing to do with me anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I feel almost...cleansed. After all, this me despises you all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Haha, I see. That's too bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's not over, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If we don't purify Beelzebub's core, then we'll be right back where we started.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>This time, I will completely destroy that Cursed Beast myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>"My corporeal form shall be the key! My ego shall reach the great plains, and overturn the cosmic principles!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>"No longer do you bear any corruption. Forget that you ever opposed us."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>"Be laid to rest, our sin!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(It responded! I'm sure I just felt the sinful magil being pulled from the core of the Cursed Beast...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I think that should do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Did it work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Wait, Nimul! I'm hearing some strange voices...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh? No, that light can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The pillar has been cleansed of sin, has it? It is a very, very clear display of your loathing for the way of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>But it's been quite interesting. I suppose I will take responsibility for this blunder. What...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The day you will receive your comeuppance for what you have done is nigh. Whether or not you accept it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I will find my way into this place. It is inevitable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That light just now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hmm? The voices went away...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Where did the core go? Nimul, what...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Ah... It looks like we've still a long way to go to finding the truth of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(Perhaps beyond that Gate filled with eternal light lay the secrets of the Cursed Beasts...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(I get the feeling that is the case, at least.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That was spectacular. I certainly hadn't expected to see a Cursed Beast sealed away so magnificently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(I was too focused on performing the technique. Where did that man come from...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Apologies. I did not mean to startle you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Unfortunately, I have my own situation to consider.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I asked, who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Ah... I had hoped to have everyone here before I gave my self-introduction...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>But I suppose it's not so important. I'll just tell you what I'm called.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I am Ignacio. I am an agent attached to an organization called the Infinite Serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The Infinite... So that makes you an ally of Icona and Zafeiris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Oops! Now you've really put your guard up! This is why I didn't wanted to say this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Have you come here to get revenge for your comrade?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Ha! A splendid joke. No, no, I am not here for anything of the sort. I'm no hero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Then why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Hm... Well, it's sort of a "The sky is falling! The end of the world is near!" kind of thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>(Come to think of it, Zafeiris did say something like that...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Huh?! An earthquake... This is absurd! We don't get these in Gula Belt Region!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What's that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>The sky... There's a crack in the Cosmic Egg?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Well, how wonderful. It seems we're all on the same page now. That, my friends, is why I'm here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Now that you understand the situation, I have a proposal for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Work with us, Pursuers of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>The world has begun to change into a form I never imagined with remarkable speed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>The anomaly that occurred in the Gula Belt Region, the so-called agent from the Infinite Serpents...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...And the threat posed by the existence of the Cursed Beasts. We still did not understand the truth behind it all.</td>
</tr>
