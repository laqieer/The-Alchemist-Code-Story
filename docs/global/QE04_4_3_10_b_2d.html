<td>It may all end here...but this is also where everything begins anew. No... We're the ones who'll set the beginning in motion! Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Alia. Tehre. Fuu. Voda... Father! We're going to protect the Saga you've entrusted to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>O wind! Usher a new breeze upon this land of Saga! Haaaaaaaarggh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Beelzebub's radiating light! What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's so pretty...and warm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Look! The plants... The trees... The land... Everything that was destroyed by the dragon is returning back to normal! Even the people have been brought back to life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey, Kiki! Adel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Kiki! Adel! Haha, stop! That tickles! Does anyone know what just happened?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I haven't got a clue, either! Wh-what was that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You did well. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Tehre! You're alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Tamis. Mocca. You've done me proud!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Fuu?! But...how?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Voda! How are you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>One day, you will realize that the world is full of mysteries... Especially when you've lived as long as I have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>How is any of this possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>For the time being, let us return to the Wind Temple. We must seal Beelzebub before it becomes gluttonous again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Tamis, would you do the honors?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes, Fuu! I'll see to everyone's return with my new wind powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So, what in the world happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Do you remember when Georgios called Beelzebub a preemptive curse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Purifying such a curse can cause its effects to reverse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh, that's right! He imparted some of his power of purification into it. Then...this was all his doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Not quite. The tempest you summoned at the end was the same power that the Sephirans once held. It was that which purified Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This is the subsequential blessing! Everything stripped from us by the curse has been restored. Triggering the blessing...was my endgame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Georgios! Thank you for saving us all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We are only here because you proved that our faith in you was well-deserved. You have my gratitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm so glad you're back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey, Mocca. Don't you think Saga's actually a really beautiful place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yep. It really is, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Tina, thanks for everything! Without you, none of this would've been possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You've been behind me every step of the way. I'm still nowhere near returning the favor! Besides, no single individual should take the spotlight for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We seized this outcome together, and we all deserve to bask in the glory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Tamis, shall we inform all of Saga of your elevation to Alia at the next Divine Conclave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes, please do. I will do my utmost to live up to the name of Alia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Who would've ever thought there'd be four of us again? I'd wager Alia, too, is overjoyed at the prospect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hmph. If you really have the luxury to reminisce about the past, you should be looking toward the future instead. Don't burden the young ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>There is still much work to be done. We may have neutralized Beelzebub, but the Jam remain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm aware! That's why we're here, putting together a plan, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Henceforth, not just the two of you, but all the people of Saga shall cooperate with one another and live in harmony with the land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Our role is to guide everyone. We must pass down what's happened here as a warning to future generations as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Excuse us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Tina, Mocca... Are you departing so soon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes. Tamis, take good care of Saga for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Of course! The climate of the desert can change at a moment's notice, so you look after yourself, too, Mocca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The purification power of the Sephira may be able to completely heal Mocca's curse, but how we can even begin to proceed is beyond my comprehension.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Where there's a will, there's a way. We can't just leave it to fester.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>But are you sure about coming along? What about your hawk friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Badalf will be fine. I've already decided, anyway...that I'm going you pay back for all you've done for me. The only reason you have that curse on your arm in the first place is because you were protecting me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You've given me far too much. This time, it's my turn. I'm going to be right behind you, wherever you decide to go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Haha. You two truly share a wonderful friendship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Where is Lisbeth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>She's begun her training. Young, she may be, but she's learning at an unbelievable rate—like a bed of coral thriving in water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Please, give her my regards, and tell her we'll see each other again someday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I will be sure to tell her. Do you have Beelzebub with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I do...but are you sure I should be the one to carry it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It has been completely neutralized by the combined power of all four Matters. It is merely a stone now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Truthfully, it should have been returned to Gluttony Foss, but we can't do so until we figure out who should be its rightful owner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>With Georgios gone...there's no rush to give it back any time soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I can't believe the gall in him. Even though he was brought back to life, he decided to go off on some journey alone, without even saying goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We will leave it in your care for safekeeping. I hear the Sacred Stones are causing a ruckus throughout the other provinces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Use your foresight to see what is to come. You will surely understand what kind of role you alone can play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It is said that the Sacred Stones are drawn to one another. They will lead you on your path, to new encounters and new horizons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yes, I'll make sure to keep Beelzebub safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You, too, Mocca and Tina. Be well on your journey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Oh yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I wonder what Georgios is up to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Who knows? Maybe fate will see us run into each other again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Georgios... We're heading to the desert, based on a clue you gave us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>The Sephira, who we all thought to be extinct...may, in fact, still exist—just as you survived. We'll seek them out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We're going to find a way to heal Mocca's curse and pass onto your brethren the story of how a man like you fought proudly to honor them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>We're survivors. The next time we meet, we'll tell you all about our journeys...Georgios.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Shall we set off?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>All right! To the desert...and beyond!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Tina! Mocca! Good luck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Take care!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>See you again sometime, Rega! You too, Kiki! Adel! Off we go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Tina! Mocca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Lisbeth! We weren't expecting you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I came to see you off! Sorry, I would've loved to go with you, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I have so many things to learn from Voda. I'm positive they'll be the key to saving Lustburg from a bind someday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Don't worry, we know you have your reasons...but this parting feels a tad strange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I know exactly what you mean: We're leaving Saga, while Lisbeth gets to stay in our homeland.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>By the way, you can stop your manly strut! We already know you're a girl! A rather pretty one, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>H-hey! What's wrong with how I walk?! Besides...it's not really something I can change on a whim, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Well, you should do whatever comes natural to you—just like how Saga's becoming one with nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>She's absolutely right! I'll take you all to the entrance to the desert! Hey... We'll all see each other again, won't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Of course we will! We're pals, aren't we?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Sorry, this is about as far as we can take you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>This is perfect. Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I've got some unfinished business here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>A way to revive the Sacred Stones... It's not like I thought it was going to be easy...but this is getting ridiculous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>The wind's getting dang dry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I've come here just as the stone urged me to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Can't say as that I've ever been to a desert before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>The time...has come.</td>
</tr>
