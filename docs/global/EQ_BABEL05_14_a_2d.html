<td>001</td>
<td>Grandma, I'm back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ahhh, what a day! I can't believe I got so lost, even though I've been there before! I was sure I'd end up passed out on the side of the road again or something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I didn't even get to see Lofia this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh, yeah, she's my friend from Lustburg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, oh! But the nice old wizard promised me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He said that Lofia will come visit us soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, I almost forgot! I have a present for you! Here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You said you've been getting cold lately, right? This should help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I just keep remembering things from the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Things like...how the main reason to eat sweets is because they make you feel happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And...how the reason for inviting someone to a tea party is because eating together makes the food taste better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I guess I can't help but reminisce.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There are many words that describe homesickness: longing, yearning, wistfulness...nostalgia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's not merely missing the place, but also the deep-seated fear that you will never see it again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I couldn't bring myself to take up my Court Mage vestments after that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I feared that, having learned the secrets of Alchemy and the Sacred Stones, I wouldn't be able to return if I donned them again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Court Mages must be prepared to fight to protect their beloved nation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That idea never sat well with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I was afraid that possessing such power would mean that I could never go back to the easy life I once enjoyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I have a very important promise that I must keep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Lofia...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I want to protect the things I love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If I can do that, then regardless of how terrified I may be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Even if it means that I can never go home...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I have to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>L-Lofia! If you keep going, you'llâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I think I finally understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I am mostly made of sugary sweets, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The sugary sweetness, the divine aroma, the squishy softness... I may not be able to enjoy these things anymore, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I know that eating together will make the food taste better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Kill her! She's weak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Grraaarrrggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huzzaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>G-goodness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>A talented Court Mage can work with any weapon at her disposal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Nyx. You ought to help out, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>M-me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I can't do this alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Y-you know I can't interact with things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I don't have the kind of power my sister has.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Urgh! All I've done is talk about fighting for the future! I'm sick of talking about it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I want to do something, but what can I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>If you don't have enough magic, all you need to do is use what you have around you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What is that supposed to mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The wintry magic that exploded from Ravina, the Alchemia diffused by Cheryl's Alchemy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Take a pinch of this and a handful of that, throw it all into your cauldron, mix in some lizards and whatever else catches your eye, bring it to a boil, and poof! You've got magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I-I've never even done something like that before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Give it a try!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Once I've made up my mind, it's time to act! It doesn't matter if I have no idea how I'm going to achieve my goals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>There's no time like the present. What's the point of needless worrying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hahah! This is crazy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I can feel this power welling up inside me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It's just like magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Well, duh! You're just as magical as I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I guess I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It always pays to have insurance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Insurance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The Demonic Soldiers are powered by the Alchemy Source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>We have prepared things so that, should they be activated, they will carry out their objectives under Corpse's command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I never dreamed that so many Demonic Soldiers would be roused from their slumber, however. In that regard, I am as amazed as you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Resistance is, in a word, impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I am not fond of the word impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Be that as it may...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>To be a Mage is to make miracles happen, wouldn't you agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That is why I am here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I will not let you stand in my way anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Grrrooogggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Groooohhhhh! Graaaaarrrrrgggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It is just as Lord Waginau said! The Demonic Soldiers have been stirred to life by their magic, and obey our commands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Kill the witches!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>This...is certainly not ideal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Can we handle this ourselves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Heh. We're not alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Time is ticking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Groogghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I know now that this world isn't a lost cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Corruption, ruin... So long as time ticks on, these things will exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>However, there are those who fight to protect their comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Alchemy is surely...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Ngh! Wh-what is that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Lofia, Cheryl... This is all thanks to you two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You have carried your hopes for the hopeless future, and held on to them through despair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>You are not alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>You are alive. The past may be sweet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Or it may be bitter. It changes nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I'll give it a try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>That's the spirit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>The bridge formed by such convictions can only be traversed when the chasm between despair and hope is at its widest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Everyone has people that they are determined to meet again, even in death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I don't want to waste that belief I once held.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Time may be infinite, but I'll lend you my strength here and now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Mira...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>We'll meet when the time is right. If we work together, I think we can make it happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>The nonexistent future, the devastated present... Let it all become a thing of the past!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I'll lend you my magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Take it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Space-Time Manipulator!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Adrift in the sea of time, the pendulum stirs the depths of the waves. Gather where the light falls, that I may see you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Sea floor and cerulean sky, woven and unfurled. Be it chance or be it fate, we are chased by dreams both infinite and finite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Now, come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Chance Encounter!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>You did it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Yeah... I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I thought I heard bells ringing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Long time no see... I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>You wouldn't call us for no reason, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>What a pleasant surprise to meet you here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>We need your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>You're that pretty lady from before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>P-pretty...lady...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I've been meaning to thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Th-thank you very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Uh... Why are you the one saying thank you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I-I...! I'm really not used to this at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>You mean, to being called a pretty lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Oh, p-please stop calling me that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Come to think of it, what would have happened if Albea was in the bath when you called us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I-I wasn't in the bath!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I know you weren't. You kinda stink.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Y-you...! Just because I wasn't in the bath just now, doesn't mean that I don't take baths at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>You look annoyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>That's because I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>There it is! There's that honesty! I love it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Urgh! You haven't changed a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Heheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Lofia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Ravina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>L-look over there! That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Ohohohoh! If it isn't a certain special young lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Michael!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Nyx, is this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Ahuh. This must be Chance Encounter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Wh...? How do you know that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Wielding a thousand magics makes one qualified. Having more than ten thousand experiences makes one elite. Accumulating a hundred million pieces of information under one's cap makes them quite robust indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>I've merely read my worth in ancient tomes, several times over. That is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Michael! You're alive! Y-you're really here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Come now, Ravina, you must be more considerate of the elderly. Perhaps you ought to rest a little longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Hey, Nyx!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Mira?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>I finally found you! Where have you been?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>That's my line!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Heh! I've been working hard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Wh-why are they here? They should be...dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>I think that's because...I'm always looking to the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>When I connected you to the manipulator, I bridged myself to the convictions we hold in our time, and drew in the causality of the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>You got Albea and Wilhelm caught up in it too, since they've been exposed to my Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>So you went back in time and brought Michael and the others with you? Is that what happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Everyone has people they are determined to meet again, even in death. The people who believe in that possibility, and in turn, those for whom they yearn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>I figured we might as well bring them all together again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>You have created a space that has transcended both the loss of life and the passage of time. This is most unusual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Amazing, ain't it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>What are you looking so proud of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>To put it bluntly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>You can only meet like this, irrespective of your past and future selves, right here, right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>I won't forget, even if you ask me to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>But I won't see you...if that is how it must be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Heheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>You know, these two are a royal pain in the butt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Yes, well... To put it bluntly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>I think you're a genius too, Nyx.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Pfft. No way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Thank you. Thank you so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Huh? L-Lofia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Ahah... Ahahahahah... What should we do? I've run out of energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>She's out of magic! All because she...gave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>H-how about some sweets?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>She already ate them all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Ugh... Unnnngggghhhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>I'm so...cold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Grrroooggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>What in blazes is going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>I don't think we can keep this moment in time paused for much longer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Showdown!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Here I go... Campanella!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>I'll play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>I'm gonna win this in one burst!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Haa...haaa...haa...haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Lofia! Wh-what should we do?! Her body has gone all cold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>I'm getting to be quite forgetful in my old age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>M-Michael...? Whatâ€”?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>I was going to give this to Lady Lofia when she left for Slothstein, but it slipped my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>Wh-what is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Ohohohohoh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>You forgot this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Welcome back, Lady Lofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>I... I... I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>I'm...back. I came...back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Lofy! Lofy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>What is this place?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>Milis?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>I was chasing a water lizard when all of a sudden there was this explosion right in front of my eyes, and before I knew it, I was here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>M-Milis...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Lofy, you're down, and shaking. Did you pass out from exhaustion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>Something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>Hahah! It's the opposite of when we first met!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Ahahah. I wonder if I'm hallucinating things. Something smells sweet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>Ooh, are you talking about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>It's called caramel jaeger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>Caramel...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>It's this sweet alcohol they make in Slothstein! They've started selling it in Lustburg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>I bought it as a present for my grandma because she's been getting cold lately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>I can't believe you've never tried it, Lofy! You're missing out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>Will you...let me have some?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>Everyone should have the opportunity to enrich their lives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>It's sweet...and warm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>Grrrooogggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>Whoa! Geez, that scared me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>Milis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>Yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>I'm going to keep the promise I made to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>Huh? Did we make a promise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>As you can see, I'm in a little bit of trouble right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240</td>
<td>Will you...help me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>241</td>
<td>Two is always better than one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>242</td>
<td>We're friends, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>243</td>
<td>That's right. You're very important to me, Milis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>244</td>
<td>Would you like some pickles?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>245</td>
<td>Th-thank you for the offer, but I'm going to have to say no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>246</td>
<td>I am a Sugar Wizard, after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>247</td>
<td>Hmhm. Then for your fuel, I suppose you will take...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>248</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>249</td>
<td>Sugar Power!</td>
