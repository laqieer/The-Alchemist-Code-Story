<td>We're almost to the border. We should be seeing the Gluttony checkpoint soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The security is heavier than I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There were already rumors of nobility and merchants from Gluttony Foss defecting when we were heading into the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If Ceclidis is in control of the military, I would expect him to enforce the prevention of such things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What should we do? Should we cross the border through the mountains to avoid the checkpoint?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No. They should be here soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting, boss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Right on time. Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Merchants?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This caravan is transporting supplies and weapons to a fortress in Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A country in the throes of a civil war is the prime client to sell weapons and supplies to. It wouldn't be strange if there were to be merchants who think like that, would it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>These are real weapons, but of course we won't really be selling them to Gluttony's army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>They'll be meeting up with the rebel forces after crossing the border to make contact for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>They will negotiate their support on our behalf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Why aren't we going with them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We were attacked by the Collectors of Wisdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There is a chance that we are under their surveillance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We need to move as a small number to increase our chances of avoiding their eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Now let's join the caravan and cross the checkpoint. This is where the real fighting starts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Halt! What's in the wagon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's a shipment of supplies to the fortress. Here's my letter of introduction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This does seem legitimate. All right, move along!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Did it work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Looks like it. Hopefully nothing will go wr—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Now! Attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What the—? It's a raid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Argghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Time is of the essence! Take what you can, and set fire to the rest! Try to avoid combat where you can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This is unexpected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What should we do?! They'll take all the supplies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I say that we aid the Gluttony army here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It should make our travels ahead much easier if they owe us a favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But do not use Alchemy or Ouija. We cannot afford to have our identities uncovered just yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Don't worry, I have a bow! Let's go, Logi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'll take care of the bandits around the wagon!</td>
