<td>Have you managed to enhance until Lv 20? That's nothing yet. Let's continue further!</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Afterwards, you can check Moon Star Armor from your Gear List.</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>Right now, there should 3 stars lined up on the Moon Star Armor frame. That means it has 3★ Rarity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Raising this Rarity is called evolving.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Next, we're going to evolve the Moon Star Armor to 4★ Rarity.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Listen. The higher Rarity your gear is, the higher the Max Lv becomes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>In other words, by increasing Gear Lv, you can enhance even more as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>According to my example, by evolving, you can increase the Max Lv to 25.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hm?! How about evolving it to its Max immediately?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You idiot! Everything has its time and place. If you skip the order, you'll create something soulless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>For example, say you were to make miso soup. First of all, you would take the soup stock, mix the miso in, and then place it over the fire...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Anyway... In order to evolve it to 4★, you'll need an additional 75 Moon Star Armor Shards. Go collect them...</td>
