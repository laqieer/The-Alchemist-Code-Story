<td>...Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Disappointing. I didn't take you for a deserter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I can't say I blame you for running away, given the circumstances...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But as Lord Commander, you couldn't have made a more foolish choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>In the name of preserving the balance of this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I, Irene of Corpse, sentence you to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That concludes my report, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Thank you. Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(This whole thing stinks.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(The Lion Monarch's Charge and the Giant Taurus left the Holy Guard in tatters.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(We're only now getting back on our feet.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(But recently, we've been assigned endless archaeological investigations...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(And possible successors to the post of Lord Commander keep getting put out of commission, or worse. That can't be an accident.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>As I said, I believe the time has come for you to step aside as Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You have served the Holy Guard admirably. Brought it back from the brink, even.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But I believe it is the new generation, raised in the light of peace, who must lead the world into a new age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I can't give up now. I still have an oath to uphold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I admire your dedication, of course, but I must warn you: if you imagine yourself to be acting for the good of all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well. Then you are gravely mistaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(Corpse must be behind this.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Sir? Is something amiss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hm? Oh, nothing. My apologies. You are dismissed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Our most promising members fall one by one, day by day, while the Holy Order's assassins prowl around in the shadows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Outwardly we're recovering, but in reality things are worse than ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If I could just learn to wield Excalibur, then maybe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If only you were here, Commander Kanon... I'm sure you would know what to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>There was so much more I wanted to learn from you. So much I still had to offer you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But I can't hide in your shadow forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The future has been left in our hands. We have to prove that we can handle that responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'm gonna be the one who protects the peace of Babel, and don't you forget it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It's our duty to build the peaceful future our captains hoped for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>On that day, I swore I'd realize the justice you entrusted to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We swore to build a peaceful world with our own hands, and thanks to each other, we've stayed our course ever since.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So I have to do what I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I lived in darkness, once. I'll never be pure enough to illuminate it, but I can expose it from within and drag it out into the light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The real question is whether I'm strong enough...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>There is no need to dwell on things so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Pain, sorrow, hesitation, doubt... They mean nothing before the absolution of order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Are you certain, sir? It's just a routine investigation. We can take care of it ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Think nothing of it. I only want to make sure we don't suffer any more unfortunate casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'll lead from the front. I expect you to follow my orders as best you're able, but also to know your limits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(Now isn't the time for second thoughts. I have a duty to uphold.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(I must realize the justice I was entrusted with, and I must fulfill my oath.)</td>
</tr>
