<td>Captain Cadanova, what did you want to discuss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Kudan... I've decided to remove you from our next expedition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What? Why, Captain?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Apparently, the one who is no longer with us has now returned to Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What?! Does he have anything to do with this expedition?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I believe there is a possibility he may show up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>His strength is on another level. To be honest, it would make me anxious to bring you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's nonsense! I'm Vice-Captain of the 4th Regiment! You're well aware of my abilities!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The problem isn't your abilities; it's the "darkness" that you carry with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>When one who wields Alchemy seeks more power than necessary, it creates an opening for darkness to enter. That is the exact state you are in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's a good thing to be ambitious. However, if you were to seek more power to counter a powerful foe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There is a risk that you would be consumed by darkness. This is something we must prevent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>B-but!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Kudan, I'm ordering you as your captain. Please don't question me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Of course I will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Please take back what you just said. If you won't, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Aghh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Kudan. There will come a day when you'll understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Argh! Argh! Argh! Argghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>At that moment, I understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>My strength was so insufficient that I was not even allowed into battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If I had managed to convince Captain Cadanova to take me with him...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I would have been able to fight alongside my comrades!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>My weakness is what drove Wadatsumi to destruction!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The only way to enforce justice is through power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I later confirmed this belief of mine in the worst way possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It was by the cruel death of my captain, who underestimated the strength of power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Captain! Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What's the matter?! Are you okay? The enemy is just around the corner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>A-ah, sorry. I'm fine now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Okay, Captain! Let's go! Hyaaaah!</td>
</tr>
