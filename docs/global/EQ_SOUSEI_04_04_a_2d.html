<td>002</td>
<td>Old dog! Nyx! What's your status?</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's not looking good. Once they appeared, my connection to Mira was severed.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Someone somewhere in this forest is spilling out sinful magil. That's drawing out the Sinners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's not all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Just as I thought.</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There's something different about these Sinners...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh? What does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Their endurance, strength, and speed... They are leaps and bounds ahead of any of the Sinners we've fought before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The magil they have is on a different level. These Sinners were once Sephira...</td>

<td>"O time, spin on! All life be limited, and thou art no exception!"</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There's no end to them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We can't panic. We've just have to focus on finding a way through them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We won't be able to meet up with Nimul and the others until we do that. That's our only choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yeah... At our current strength, that's the only way we can deal with being surrounded like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Shoot! Guess we've gotta do it this way! Immediately dispatching Engineer Soldiers to form a blockade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Corruption won't affect them! Everyone, take cover!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Very well. Let's go, Nyx!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Right. I'll bring up the rear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Mira, Nimul... Please be okay!</td>
