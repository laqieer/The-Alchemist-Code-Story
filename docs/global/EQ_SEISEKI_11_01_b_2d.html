<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I can't give up... Not yet! I have to hurry and tell Kanon...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It is you... I never thought that I would meet you in the middle of the desert like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Kagura...? What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Um... Do I know you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No, but I know you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You were the one sealed in the Stone in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I also spent some time traveling with Kudanstein...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>With Kudan...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ugh...gh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You've been under this desert sun for too long. You shouldn't push yourself so hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Is this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's just water. There's no poison in it.</td>

<tr>

<td>Yeesh. Slow down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>If that strange man hadn't appeared, I would have never found you here. You're lucky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Strange...man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Some guy showed up and told me that you were here. He called himself the "guardian of the sand" or something, but seemed to just be some kind of desert dweller.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Friend of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I don't...think so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I suppose it doesn't matter. More importantly, what are you even doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This isn't the kind of place for a Captain of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Did you know anything about Kudan still being alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What...? That guy is still alive?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You didn't know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hm... This is an interesting development.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If you're around, the likelihood of that guy showing up increases significantly. Come. I'll lend you a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...!</td>
