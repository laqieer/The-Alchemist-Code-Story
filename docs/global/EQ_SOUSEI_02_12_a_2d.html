<td>Tch! I thought we'd already taken care of those two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ambrosia's in danger! If they're using Space-Time Manipulation, then we should be there to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No, Mira. We can't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Nyx! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That those two are here can only mean Asmodeus is close by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If the Cursed Beast shows up before the magic rod is ready, we have no way to face it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We need to be here, doing our part in this plan! Nobody else can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Nyx is right. We have to focus on getting the magic rod Libra ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That is what we must do to help the others out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But Ambrosia was wounded so badly by them last time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If she gets hurt again... If she were to die...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If that happens... I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Mira...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>She'll be okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Nimul said... My friends said to leave it to them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So I'm going to do what they expect me to be doing! I know I can trust them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...Okay. I'll trust them too. So, what do we have to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The old man and I are going to fire up the reactor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But it's going to take time. I need you two to prepare the magic rod to be connected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's all a race against time! I can do this! I can definitely do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'll show everyone what an engineer from the Acedia Belt Region can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Asmodeus... You've summoned a replication of my apprentices again, I see. I take it you've grown attached to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hah, well, they are my apprentices. With a teacher like myself, I'd be more surprised if they weren't excellent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Now is not the time to be bragging! We cannot let it damage the airship more than it already has!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I know, I know. Let me show you the true powers of a witch of this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Space-Time Manipulation, activate! For I am the life that devours the fruit of the Holy Spirit! I am the one who embraces the seven virtues!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Nng! Something is being pulled out of us...! This is...our essence?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What have you done, Ambrosia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hah, you dare call me by my name? Still feeling chummy with your teacher after all that you've done?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well, shall I explain, friend? It's very simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You two are nothing more than concentrated aggregations of the possibility contained within my true apprentices, molded from the Cursed Beast's magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>From your head to the tip of your toes, you are vulnerable to my Anti-Lust magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But this is... If that's true, why didn't you use this in the last battle?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Indeed, you really kept me on my toes the last time. When I was fighting you, I'd already spent almost all of my magil to get one good hit in on Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But now, I am fully recharged. Undoing your being is child's play to me now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(Well, honestly speaking, I wouldn't be able to keep this up for long without Libra's support.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Argh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This is it, younglings! Quickly, while I have them pinned down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Let's go, Waginau! We will defeat them now and remove them from the equation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Right! Let us repay our debts from our last encounter!</td>
</tr>
