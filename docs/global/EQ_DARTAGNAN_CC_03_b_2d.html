<td>What do you think, Yura? Can you follow it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes... The trail of Alchemia leads that way. We should continue straight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>They must be using the ruins ahead as a base of operations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wow, Yura! I would have had no idea without you...</td>

<td>The commander is able to gather information from even the slightest trace. She really is amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I am pretty confident in tracking, though it's never really been that useful on missions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I think being able to move quickly like D'Artagnan would be much more useful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's not true! Look how useful it is to us right now!</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Um, Yura? Thanks for before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh?</td>

<td>I was a little short-sighted, just thinking about how I wished humans and therians could get along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Because I grew up in the city, I had never given much thought to why therians might prefer to live in the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Or why anyone would choose to live anywhere, I guess. I figured no matter where I went, I'm still me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But not everyone feels the same way I do. Everyone has their own experiences and thoughts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Thank you for showing me that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You really are something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's nothing. Let's continue ahead.</td>
