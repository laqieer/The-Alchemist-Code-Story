<td>But...it's too dangerous for just the two of you to go alone! Both of you know that the Jam are growing stronger, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Moreover, their numbers are increasing rapidly as well. Can't I go along as well?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Asena's forest must not be intruded with great numbers... That has been defined in the law as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Just like the Ritual of Baptism.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But...they have the trial to worry about as well! For starters, what even is this "one's own darkness" business?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>All humans have a darkness within them. If you cannot defeat this darkness when it takes on a shape of its own, then Asena will not acknowledge you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You wish to resurrect the Wind Matter, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Then, of course, you should gain Asena's acceptance and obtain a token.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>All the more reason why I should go too...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There is no need for a foreigner to intrude. This trial is to be faced only by one of Saga. It is a task for these two alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But...what if something were to happen to the two of them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You wish to save Saga? One who falls by the wayside cannot speak of the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Very well. Mocca and I will head to Asena. We will obtain a token at all costs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>And we will have you attend the Sprite Trio Discourse! After all, I have sworn to protect the future of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well then. I look forward to seeing whether or not you possess the ability to deliver on your promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's late now. It will be better for the two of you to depart in the morning. Let us all rest for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tina...Mocca...are you really okay? Isn't there something I can do to help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hehe. Thank you, Lisbeth. Sorry to have gotten you involved in this, but this is a problem for those of Saga to deal with. We can't get you involved any further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Lisbeth, please look after things while we're gone. The way things are now with the Jam, we cannot let our guard down. And we've promised to protect the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There's no need for you to worry. I'll protect this village. The two of you should focus on protecting your own lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We'll do so. We'll do whatever we can to retrieve a token from Asena and return here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>However, what exactly is a token?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I know! Fuu, when you became a Sprite, you obtained a token, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes. It's called Asena's Tear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Asena's Tear...?! What is it to be exact?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It is something given to only those who overcome the trial and are acknowledged by Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That one tear alone contains an overwhelming amount of Ouija.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And we must pass the trial to obtain one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Indeed. However, I am not certain whether your power is enough to pass the trial...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Only those who display power appropriate to become a Sprite can obtain one of Asena's Tears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And the defeating of "one's own darkness" that Tehre spoke of...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It is forbidden by law to speak of it. However, there is just one thing I can say to the two of you...don't allow yourself to be consumed by it. That is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's it; I'm going! I can't allow just the two of them to go somewhere so dangerous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No...Tehre is right. This is something that Mocca and I, who are natives of Saga, must overcome. Don't you agree, Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes. Of course. Lisbeth, please take care of matters here while we're gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Please, trust us for now. We leave tomorrow morning... Tina and I will bring back this token at all costs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>For that reason, let's finish patrolling and rest early.</td>
</tr>
