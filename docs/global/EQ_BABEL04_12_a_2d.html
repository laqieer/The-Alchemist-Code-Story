<td>The past should be left behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yet that rarely seems to happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Instead, the past haunts us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It binds us to the present, turning our gazes away from the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The day my childhood was ended, my memories were swept away like seeds on the wind, and returned to the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Perhaps one day they will bloom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Nourished as they are by corruption...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They should grow well, and blossom into beautiful flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So long as I am looking at those flowers, I will be able to move forward, even if I am looking over my shoulder all the while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Even a step backward will take me forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Even if I should trip or fall on the way, I am sure that everything will be all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But as for right now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Figs, humans. Pepper, mushrooms. Burdock, corpses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Burdock, corpses. Spring herbs, toadstools. Cucumber, winter melon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Count to one hundred, and get a demon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Figs, humans. Pepper, mushrooms. Burdock, corpses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's like a horde of demons passed through here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power is spreading corruption everywhere it goes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The corruption is steadily turning the people of Wadatsumi, the Shiba Senko, and the soldiers from Greed Dike into demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What about Yomi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Since the Mikaboshi was taken from her, she has weakened considerably, and will not wake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But...that's not the worst of it. There's also...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Jin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I couldn't stop it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Kagutsuchi didn't affect it. There was nothing I could do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I was pathetic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The duty of the royal family...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I know. I need to pursue it, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>In that case, perhaps I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Perhaps I could...help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yomi was no match for it, even after turning into a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I cannot betray my country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>As the General of Greed Dike, for my country, and for Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I will not abandon a friend in need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Both Yomi and Jin assisted me, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Did that sound immature?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It was excellent. A fine speech.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If possible, I'd like to...um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Come on, out with it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>T-t-to help you, as your...f-friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm sorry if the notion, um, offends you. I just thought that...since we share goals for the future, we could be comrades, fighting side by side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Didn't I insult you? Are you a sucker for punishment or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That was then. This is now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You helped Yomi, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So I want to help you in return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You're a good person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I am...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I-I guess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What are you blushing for? I'm hardly praising you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Heheh...heheheheheheh. I've never been told that I'm a good person before. Heheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ngh... What is that laugh?! Stop that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Oh, please don't cringe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I was just...happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I...don't dislike you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'm used to good people who are abysmally foolish, thanks to a certain someone I used to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>A certain...someone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>A good person, and a fool, like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I feel like you're making fun of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>That's because I am making fun of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Ngh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>But isn't that part of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Of being friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yomi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Um, are you...feeling better?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I don't just mean your injuries, but also, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Thank you, Leafah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Y-Yomi...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power is likely headed for my village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>That's the only place I can think of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>There is a statue behind my village in the shape of a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>It has been absorbing the corruption in the world and suppressing the demon blood in the people of Wadatsumi. You could say that it is one of the guardians of this nation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I believe that the Discarnate Power intends to use the Mikaboshi to release the corruption from that statue into the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>If that happens, the entire country—perhaps even the entire continent—will be overrun by demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Onigashima...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It's all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>We made a promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>A promise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>My brother and I—we made a promise together...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>And I'm going to keep it.</td>
