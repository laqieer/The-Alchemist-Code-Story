<td>The jutting rocks forming the backdrop against sparse racks of machines and a single, pulsing glass tube in the center was too similar to Atropos.</td>

<td>Off to the side, Blair laid unmoving, her limbs bound and mouth gagged.</td>

<td>Time's a-wasting, so I'll get straight to the point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We know who you are, and what you're capable of. The specifics? Not my problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>In there is what you're looking for, and you're going to awaken her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Soren lifts his head, squinting at the faint silhouette imprisoned within.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wait...That's Lachesis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ouch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Get to it, boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(Looks like I don't have a choice.)</td>

<td>Hello?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>020</td>
<td>Ugh...am I dreaming?</td>

<td>...He will be fine, Elder. Your grandson will be well again in no time.</td>

<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Isn't that right, Master?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Of course. We will do our utmost best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Thank you. Elylon Teg owes much to the two of you.</td>

<td>If it wasn't for you, we would have lost many of our youth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Come, Lachesis. We must see our patient at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Soren's hand passes through the elder, who makes no reaction.</td>

<td>(Another vision, huh...)</td>

<td>Within the shack, a young man lays bundled in furs and cloth, his body wracked with spasms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>He's beginning to convulse. Lachesis, quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The youth shudders as his body flares briefly with light, which dissipates toward Lachesis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Whew... We were just in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>A moment too soon and he might have succumbed to the Alchemia poisoning his system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(Alchemia...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(Isn't that just like Eira?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(Emrys did say she suffered from what they called a "curse"...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(And Lachesis seems capable of curing it!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Do you remember now, Master?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Eira's in danger...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Don't worry. I won't let her fall into their clutches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'll save everyone this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hehe. That's more like the Master I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ah... But you're in danger too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Well? What did you do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You've been spacing out for fifteen minutes and there hasn't been a single movement in that tube.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I- I don't know. It's not as if I could just *will* her to move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You can't, or you won't?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Guess you need some encouragement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Mmmrph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Waste my time again and you can say goodbye to your friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Blair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Master!</td>

<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>A ripple pulses through the room, causing Grimm to suddenly jolt.</td>

<td>Nrgh! What the- My head-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Soren quickly slices through Blair's bonds with his hunting knife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>All right there?</td>

<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Could be better once we get out of here!</td>
