<td>Don't kill her, Grimm. We need her ALIVE!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Haah!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Nice try... You're not escaping a second time!</td>

<td>That staff can talk!</td>

<td>Driven by primal rage, Red swings her greatsword with wild abandon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Her burning eyes meet Grimm's gaze, and it is then when predator met predator—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...GRAAHHH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The killing shot pierces Red's body, and the light in her eyes immediately extinguishes.</td>

<td>*KKKRRRRR*</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ugh...vicious brute.</td>

<tr>

<td>She- She's down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Blair thumps helplessly at the tightly-shut metal door.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No good. We need an access key, and I don't see any panels I can hack into—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I am getting incredibly weary of chasing vermin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Lower limb amputation would decrease their chances of running by a hundred percent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You've created monsters...and now you've *become* them as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Had there been a miracle cure like the one you created for the Elylon Teg, would I be here today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Life is cruel and unfair. But I make the most of my second chance, and I will claw my way through a mountain of corpses if need be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...I've said enough. Good night, Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Blair spares a glance at the destruction wrought mere moments ago, and spots a malfunctioning control panel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(No time to think... Here goes!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(Sorry, Rox. Guess I'll be joining you in the league of courageous fools.)</td>

<td>Blair pulls out her last emergency explosive and lobs it at the sparking panel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>The entire facility drowns in a flash of light, heat, and sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What were the results?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>They've been recovering well, Master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>While the root cause can't be eliminated entirely, the incidence rate will remain extremely low if we continue the treatment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Heartening news indeed. Thank you, Lachesis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'll pack up for the night then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...That being said, this method of treatment is unlikely to last forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I have yet to measure the Alchemia levels within her; all that excess must go somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>And if she happens to perish from this excess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...Her demise might very well collapse the ecosystem and cause uncontrollable growth and mutations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No, there needs to be a better solution. It is still imperfect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Is this the place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Minerva's crystal pulses with a faint, bluish light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yes, but Soren's trail is faint. A significant amount of time has passed since he was last in the area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We'd better get a move on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>These caverns seem almost labyrinthine. They could be anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Eira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Scary...smell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Big Bro...in danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(Red...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Eira, we'll protect you. Can you show us where the smell is coming from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>This goes much deeper than I previously thought. To think that such networks existed for ages...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Is that a...steel door?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>In the distance, a huge steel door dangles precariously from its broken hinges.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Something...coming...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I hear it... It sounds mechanical.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>*GRCHNK GRCHNK GRCHNK*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>A dirty, grimy robot clunks out of the darkness, lugging a massive tube in its arms while a small figure is draped on its shoulder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Soren and Blair follow in its wake, dazed but conscious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Everyone...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Looks like we made it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Big Bro! Smart Sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>There's a lot to unpack here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Minerva's crystal flashes as she approaches the robot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>This signature...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Why, it's identical to Soren's and Eira's!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Wait... Is that Red?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What was she doing there? Why did you bring her with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>We should get out of here first. You have my word we have good reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That cryotube...contains Lachesis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The further we can take her from this place, the better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Guess we'll pay a visit back to those old ruins of yours, Professor. It's the only place big enough...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>- Goetia Headquarters -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>The Director closes the report on the table and turns away, gazing into the darkness of the window outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>'Stolen', they say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>No matter. I suppose this only hastens our plans to their conclusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I hope you remember soon, dearest Sister...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I will be waiting for you.</td>
