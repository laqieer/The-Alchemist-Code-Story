<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/kaya.png" alt="Kaya" height="128"><br>Kaya</td>
<td>So when Ryui beats you in a head-to-head contest, mock battle or not, people are going to take notice. In other words, you just proved once and for all that she's a worthy paladin.</td>

<td>Firstly, never forget that that gambling tournament was unequivocally your fault!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>I hope the two of you will learn something from this and start taking your work seriously. People's hard-earned taxes shouldn't be funding your gambling habits!</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Well, you're getting one now. I want to continue working with the two of you. And thanks to the outcome of that mock battle, I'll be able to do just that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>
<td>It was no big deal. Besides, you helped us first. Not that I was glad to do all that work, but still.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>Thank you, Magnus. And you, Will. Captain Kaya, I'm grateful for everything you've done for me.</td>
