<td>Hey! W-Will! Put me down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hell, you're light as a feather! Don't you eat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Of course I do! I consume a nutritionally balanced diet for long-lasting energy and good health!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Geez... Don't you ever do anything for fun? Or enjoyment? Eat somethin' tasty once in a while! It won't kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I don't care about fun! Especially not right now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Is that really all you've got? You'll never hit the target like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ngh... It's not fair! How can a good-for-nothing lazybones like you be so strong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ouch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ryui, your powers of Alchemy just aren't a match for mine. But don't feel bad; I am, after all, a genius.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Heh. You're just about the only person who can say that and it not be an exaggeration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Listen, Ryui. You're going up against the Alchemy nut who only joined the Holy Guard to research Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>In other words, he's in his element. This is what he wants to do. This is what he enjoys doing. That's what makes him so strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So, what about you? What do you want to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Right now, I want to win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's not what I mean and you know it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I don't know... What do you want to do, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Me? My whole purpose in life is to show up that Alchemy nut.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The point is, you're not alone in this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I mean, it's not like you're using me to beat Magnus. We're working on this together, right? We're a team.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So, c'mon. Let's go again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>R-right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Nice one! Turns out even that Alchemy nut doesn't stand a chance against the two of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Did I really win?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Guess so. A little hard work can go a long way, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You should be proud, Magnus. This is what you wanted, isn't it? Now no one will dare target her overtly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I have no idea what you're talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What's the point in playing dumb when you're the one who asked me to arrange this battle in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You've made enemies in the past, when you've swindled people with your little games. Of course, that's not a problem for someone of your caliber...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But if they were to use her to get to you... Now, that would be a problem, wouldn't it? On top of that, she hasn't exactly been making friends, herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well, she's honest to a fault, isn't she? It's a bit of a double-edged sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Add to that her flagging results during the mock battle on her first day...and you found yourself faced with a situation that, as her mentor, you had to rectify.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You might show an utter lack of dedication to your work, but when it comes to Alchemy, you're as talented as they come, and everyone knows it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So when Ryui beats you in a head-to-head contest, mock battle or not, people are going to take notice. In other words, you just proved once and for all that she's a worthy paladin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>All in all, I'd say that gambit was a huge success. What do you think, Ryui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You're still here, are you? I thought you went back to the barracks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Eavesdropping, were we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I-I... I just wanted to tell you a few things before I left!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Firstly, never forget that that gambling tournament was unequivocally your fault!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I hope the two of you will learn something from this and start taking your work seriously. People's hard-earned taxes shouldn't be funding your gambling habits!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You heard the lady. Get to work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ha-ha, Will. And...okay, Ryui. We've already said we're sorry. What more do you want from us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well... Secondly, it would seem that while you were the ones who got me into this mess, you're also the ones who got me out of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hey, you beat me. Nothing can change that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Will, the other day, you asked me what I wanted to do with my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I did. Never got an answer, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, you're getting one now. I want to continue working with the two of you. And thanks to the outcome of that mock battle, I'll be able to do just that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It was no big deal. Besides, you helped us first. Not that I was glad to do all that work, but still.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Thank you, Magnus. And you, Will. Captain Kaya, I'm grateful for everything you've done for me.</td>
</tr>
