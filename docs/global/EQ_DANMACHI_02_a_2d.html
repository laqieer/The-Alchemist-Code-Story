<td>Hear that noise? The beasts are in a frenzy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Looks like there was an Alchemia explosion around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The beasts must sense the presence of an outside threat, and it's got them all riled up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But that could mean we just have to go to where the beasts are making a racket, and we'll find whatever it is that's popped in here from Bell's world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's the second time I've heard Alchemia mentioned now. What is it, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, it's kinda like the source of power in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ila and I were actually summoned here by the Alchemia. "Phantom Soldiers," we're called.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Summoned? Summoned from where?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We're dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Dead, but granted bodies as Phantom Soldiers so we can exist physically once more. That's how we're able to be here talking to you now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And fight in battle, of course! As you saw earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The two of us were summoned here specifically, in fact. This world may have already moved on after our deaths, but neither of us can just stand aside and do nothing when somebody threatens it again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And I swear to you, I won't let any girls cry even a single tear. Not on my watch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ugh, I really can't stand you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh, so Bell, how about you tell us a little about yourself, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well, in my world there's a huge labyrinth people just call the dungeon, sprawling deep underground. Those who dare venture into the dungeon are called adventurers, and I'm one of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What kind of monsters are there in that dungeon? That's the sort of info that might clue us in on what's happening here now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I was on one of the middle floors when I got transported here. The one monster type that poses the biggest threat in that part of the dungeon would have to be minotaurs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>How strong are they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>They're not exactly weak, but at my current level, I wouldn't normally think of them as anything to worry about, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then what makes them the biggest threat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well, the figure who brought me here said this threat was absorbing that...Alchemia stuff. And there's no telling what a minotaur imbued with energy from another world might be capable of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Still, however strong it may be, there's no enemy we can't beat if we work together as comrades—as friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh, great. Another sunshine-and-roses type. Just what I needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Scoff if you'd like, but the friends I have in my Familia mean everything to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Comrades working together, facing challenges together, overcoming them together, and helping push each other forward through thick and thin—that's what being an adventurer is all about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Being an adventurer sounds pretty great to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's the best! The person I look up to most in the whole world is an adventurer, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh? Are they why you chose this path, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No, um, actually...the reason I became an adventurer is so I could pick up girls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm sorry, what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>See, my grandpa told me that a real man should always strive to get himself a harem...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ah, I see! Not the worst advice, and if you can make a lot of girls smile, that's wonderful. But I dare say in a harem, you're bound to make some cry instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Unbelievable. You're just as bad as he is. I can't stand you, either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Wait, no! It's not like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Uhhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That noise... It came from over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That's the way Ila went. She might be in trouble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Now's your chance to redeem yourself to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Do you think I even can?! She seems pretty set in her ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I certainly hope so!</td>
</tr>
