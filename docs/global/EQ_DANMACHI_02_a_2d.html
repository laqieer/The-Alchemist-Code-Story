</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>
<td>Well, the figure who brought me here said this threat was absorbing that...Alchemia stuff. And there's no telling what a minotaur imbued with energy from another world might be capable of.</td>

<td>Oh, great. Another sunshine-and-roses type. Just what I needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/kevi.png" alt="Kevin" height="128"><br>Kevin</td>
<td>Ah, I see! Not the worst advice, and if you can make a lot of girls smile, that's wonderful. But I dare say in a harem, you're bound to make some cry instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
