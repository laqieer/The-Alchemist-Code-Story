<td>Insensitive to illusory magicks. Good.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Now, show yourself to me, my little helgwn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ready, little one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's time to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Mmmhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Big Sis...not coming?</td>

<tr>

<td>Eira, how are you feeling?</td>

<td>Blair says the patrols have been drawn away for some reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Some altercation where Roxanne's mansion is—was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Once Siegfried gives us the go-ahead, we'll be making a break for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It seems the fates are on your side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You're sure you're not coming?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I mean—I don't mean to impose. Eira would feel more stable around you, I think... But of course, it's not—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I understand. There is something I would look into.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>For the moment, however, I believe Eira will be safe in your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Morrigan's eyes flicker over to Soren, which seem to search his face for something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...You haven't changed in the slightest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Give Blair my regards when she returns, won't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Until we next meet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Be safe, little one.</td>

<td>Morrigan rounds the corner and stands silently before a large, heavily reinforced cell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Her fingers graze the padlock on the gate before her form dissolves into shadowy wisps, appearing on the other side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Its sole occupant jolts at the intrusion, confusion knocking her out of her reverie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...You're...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>How did you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Simmering, seething beneath your skin. I see it burn, but you are unharmed...for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I don't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Little helgwn, made to bend and break for your masters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Is this what you truly want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...I hate riddles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yet you've stayed your hand. Do the guards hate you, or fear you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Why are you really here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I came to see the one who torments Eira's memory so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Red narrows her eyes, a sliver of crimson in the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You're here to kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Do not misunderstand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I merely wished to know more about Goetia's warhound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>A fox and a hound...both victims of their circumstances. How fitting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Your masters do not like the way you hesitate, it seems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You will never be free, even from your own mind...as long as you remain here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Do you understand that, little helgwn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Free...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Enough, Red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Don't waste your breath on prey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Berith...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(Ah... This aura. Familiar, somehow. Or merely a trick of mine own memories?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(Such bloodlust...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'm going a little loopy here, Red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I want to see blood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ugh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Berith... No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...Crush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Kill...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>*sigh*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>As you wish.</td>
