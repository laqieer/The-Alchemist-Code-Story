<td>Why...? How could I lose to scum like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Did you forget you lost to Kamui last time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Urg...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Excuse me, sir, it's almost time for—what happened?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh no! Kamui, this guy's completely knocked out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Knocked out?! Do you guys have any idea how much money is riding on this match?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I know! You'll compete in his place! You're clearly strong enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>W-wait a moment, this was just self defense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Either you fight or you pay for damages! You ruined one of tonight's main bouts! Do you have any idea how much money this is costing us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ah... It does not seem as though there is any room to argue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>K-Kamui! What are you gonna do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yeah! What are you gonna do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Fine, I'll fight, but I will not accept any complaints if I lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Good, now take this sword. You're going against the Champion, so don't hold back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Today is just not my day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Your Highness, King Narol! We of Gluttony Foss' Third Legion are present and accounted for, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Good work, Ceclidis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If I may speak freely, Your Highness, those under the banner of Leordas, General of the First Legion and instigator of the rebellion, are the best our country had to offer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If our forces were to face each other in a pitched battle, the victor would be determined by mere chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Are we sure peace talks are no longer on the table? This civil war was spawned from the differing perspectives of the North and South, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Killing each other over such issues serves no purpose but to diminish our country's strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Your Highness, I believe the forces of the South under Leordas will no longer hear our words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>As proof, they have kept their own council in response to your repeated edict to lay down their weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If you were to show any signs of weakness, they might see it as an opportunity to usurp the throne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We must end this rebellion, swiftly and decisively, to save this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I understand. You will have the Second Legion to command as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The entire military force of our country is at your disposal. We must suppress this rebellion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Thank you, sir, but if I may... As you know, there is another means to end this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What are you trying to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Unleash Beelzebub! With the power of the Sacred Stone, a simple rebellion would—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Silence! That is out of the question!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But why?! I know that using the Sacred Stone comes at a great cost, but it would be nothing compared to how many would be sacrificed by the strife of war!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Or is it your secret agreement with the so-called "Sephira" that is hindering your decision?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I am sorry, general. I cannot do as you say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>No matter what the situation, we must never unleash the powers of the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That King Narol! Why can he not simply do as I say? Fool! He sits on the fence even as it is about to be blown over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The whereabouts of the Sacred Stone Beelzebub are known only to the King.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The stone is no good to us sealed away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yet, we can only assist from the shadows. You are the only one who can take action directly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I know. I will find it on my own if I must!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I must know where these Sephira hide. They are the ones who keep Beelzebub hidden and sealed...!</td>
