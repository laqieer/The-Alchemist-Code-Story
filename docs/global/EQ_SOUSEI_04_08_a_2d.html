<td>So they defeated Julia, did they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>To think that pursuer of sin had a technique able to defeat a hatred so powerful that it could devour the earth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But it wasn't all a waste. Now, we can fulfill our desires with the pursuers that have been brought together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ngh... Such a huge wave of power... Why is Beelzebub's magil coming from within Sephiron?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I see. When you awakened Beelzebub, you were thrown to into another region, weren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But now that you have returned, you will understand the true form of the Sephiron you believe in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The pursuers of the Acedia Belt... The experiment performed by that woman called Icona.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>She was clever. Rewriting the shell of Cursed Beast to neutralize its power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It was a method that had already proven to be effective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Did you never have any doubts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Never question how the Sephiron could exist in this world? This miraculous spring of ever-flowing wisdom...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No, it can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You can't mean to say that Sephiron, the great tree that we've all believed in is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes. That's exactly what I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The great tree you so revered was transformed by Nidhogg's ability...from Beelzebub's very shell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You people of Sephira could never do anything like control sin. In fact...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Since ancient times, and even now, it is the "sin" you loathe so much that has given you life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Didn't I tell you how pointless it all was?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Even if that is the case, there is no way I can accept your choice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>To release that corruption into the world will only doom people to fall further into sin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Almost nothing can survive the release of that much magil! It would be utter destruction...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But there would be survivors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Like before, like that day we were destroyed, the survivors will beget new life and learn to prosper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(What...? The day...destroyed? No, more important than that...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Do you mean to repopulate the world with Sinners?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hm... Now that I think of it, there are still two fragments of Cursed Beasts left here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The one you sealed has now bored and connected to the land; the sacred pillar of our princess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>To you, what I speak of is a forgotten past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(I'm so sorry, Nimul... I can't do anything...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Grrrooooooggghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...No... How... No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This can't be... Two Cursed Beasts other than Beelzebub...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What can we even do now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This is not good. Despair is spreading amongst the villagers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>There will be no way they will stand against the Cursed Beasts in this state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes, I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Everyone, please listen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Lord Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Under these conditions, what can we even...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Do not give up. There is still hope!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We have already clashed with those two in other regions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We already know their patterns!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We have finally obtained something on par with the unwavering law of the world itself. We have the power to defeat the Cursed Beasts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>To defeat them? Does that mean you can defeat that horrible Beelzebub too...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You can do that? A person can defeat the Cursed Beasts that arise from our sins...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yes! We can defeat the Beasts, but we cannot do it with only the power that my comrades and I have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>We will overcome this crisis and defeat the Cursed Beasts! We will break free of the sin that continues to cause us so much pain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>To do this, we will need all of you. So I beg of you, please place your trust in me. Please help us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That's right... We've come this far. We can't give up now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>True... We've fought the corruption this long. We can't let things end like this. It would shame our ancestors...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Lord Nimul! We warriors have been inspired by your speech! We await your command!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Thank you, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Adaleigh, what is the status of the Cursed Beasts that have appeared?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It will take some time to get all the details, but from what I can tell they aren't moving anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>They're not moving? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>According to Libra's observations, it looks like the form of their outer shells are changing so violently that their internal magil can't stabilize with their surroundings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That is to say, while they are focused on keeping their shape, they can't move in any direction...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The cores aren't reacting at all! They're, uh, kind of like...shadows?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Right. Mirages of the void, made of magil. For now, let's call them Phantoms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...At any rate, we have time to figure something out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You all, keep watching them and get as much information as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Roger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>So what first, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Everyone is quite worn from fighting all those Sinners. First let the villagers recover, if only a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Waginau, direct the soldiers to retrieve the rations from the airship and distribute them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I already know. Inspect the gear of the warriors and make new weapons, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Yes. Strengthening our forces as much as possible would be a great help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>This is an excellent opportunity to use the technology we've acquired from our travels so far. I'll take care of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Eulalia, you and I will purify the battlefield...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Hey, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Could I have a little time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I understand. I'll go ahead and purify the area around the settlement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Julia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I can't believe you went ahead and disappeared from my life without even saying goodbye...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Even so, as priestess of the Forest of Suga, it is my job make sure those born of the forest are laid to rest in the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Rest well, Julia. Even though you reached heights most of us never did, you were also the most troubled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>In the name of Sephiron, I pray your soul is in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>It's time for me to do my part!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Glurrrrrp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Ugh, look at them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Lord Nimul! We were working with the villagers to purify the settlement, but we came across this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>It looks like they sprang up from the contaminated earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>They are a low-level corruption, but their numbers are much greater than we can handle right now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>All right. I'll take it from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>We apologize, sir! We leave it to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Now thenâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Grrrrrrragh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>This is a good chance to test the power I got as a result of the Reincarnation Ritual...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>It is the duty of the Sephira to purify the land, but at present there is little time. This will allow me to handle this promptly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
