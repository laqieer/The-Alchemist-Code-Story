<td>It appears that the Lizard Brigade had, indeed, already left prior to our arrival.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Just as Gabirond had predicted, Philosopher's Stones aside,</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>it appears they've been collecting the blood from the surrounding monsters and humans to use as a source of power for the Demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Could the Demon already be activated?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No. If it were possible to activate the Demon, they would already be utilizing it in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The fact that we have received no such news is proof that they lack the sufficient amount of power to activate it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Do you think they have embarked on collecting Philosopher's Stones as a source of power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The chances are high. We should search areas of Wratharis where Philosopher's Stones are most likely to be found.</td>

<td>I can't believe things have actually ended up like this. What Agatha feared is now a reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hm? Yeah. Fortunately, I don't seem to have suffered any major wounds. I'll be okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No, I'm talking about your mental state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Right now, you appear to be in an extremely dangerous place. I can understand finally the reason why Captain Zeke left you in our care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What are you talking about? We've no time for idle talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Dias, once again, I want you to take this to heart. Do not rely on malicious intentions. Never forget the pain that comes with wielding a sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tsk. What are you trying to say?</td>
