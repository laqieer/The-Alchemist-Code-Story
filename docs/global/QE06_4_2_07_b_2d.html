<td>002</td>
<td>Ngh... What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Jubei!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Sorry it took me so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That blade... It worked, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yeah. I owe you one, Ugachi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Forget about that right now. Let's just keep those two safe until they come out of their trance with Kagutsuchi in tow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Give me...that blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And just what do you want it for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Something about it feels familiar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Does it, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ever since I awoke, I've had this strange sensation. What is it that I wanted to do? What is it that I must protect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I feel like if I had that blade, I might remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So don't get in my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Agh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Looks like Tanosuke was right. Tamba doesn't wish for humanity's destruction. Not completely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Fools!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Why else would he seek out his own horn? He wants to return what he's lost, because he's lost sight of what he wishes to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No! You will stop talking, now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If this is what you desire, then we are not the ones you should be targeting. But you already know that...don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't you see how they're using you? They're pitting us against each other for their own gains! Why are you still helping them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You talk too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If that sword is truly forged of my horn, then I would gladly kill you all to reclaim it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ngh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Those wounds are quite deep. It's surprising you're able to move as readily as you do...and baffling, as to why you'd bother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Compared to getting one's arm cut off, this is little more than a scratch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Besides, if I can't get you to open your eyes, Tanosuke won't ever be able to come back here for me to chew him out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So I can't very well afford to be defeated here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Captain, think of your wounds! Leave this guy to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I don't care about my wounds. I will not be held down. Not by some fool who's lost sight of the things he wants to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Very well. Then you shall be the first to fall this day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Don't you go forgetting about me, now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Curses!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I grow bored of these childish tactics of yours. Let's end this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Gahh... No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(He's got us entirely outclassed... No, wait. The difference in strength between us isn't that great. Rather...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(The problem is that our attacks aren't entirely landing. We'll get nowhere at this rate.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Come on, Logi. Get back here soon! We need you!</td>
