<td>Grk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What's the matter? Did you not come here to stop me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Urk! His defense is stronger than any I've ever encountered!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Each one of the Sacred Stones has the power to topple an empire. You should be aware of this, Lord Commander of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I carry the Sacred Stones within me. I am the Vessel of Reincarnation. You ordinary folk cannot even dream of reaching my level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Nngh! A-another earthquake?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ha-haaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Look! The Tower of Babel glows ever brighter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You shouldn't have turned your back to us! Kanon, now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>On it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Drop dead! Dead the End!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is a chance we cannot afford to miss! Eternal Glow!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>D-did we get him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa... He was completely unguarded. If this doesn't work, then—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The light! Can you not see? It is near! The time of Nimul's manifestation approaches!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What?! Not even a scratch?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>B-but how?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There is nothing you can do to change what is to come. I congratulate you for being fortunate enough to witness this moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>A new challenge for humans will begin from this moment on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>A...new challenge?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Right... You mentioned something about overthrowing the gods and their rule, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Indeed. The resurrection of Nimul is a declaration of war against the gods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It is the first step humankind must take to ascend to a new state of existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>A declaration of war against the gods...?! You can't be serious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>How can I not be? Even if I were to rule over mankind, none can oppose their ultimate fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No matter how far civilization advances, mankind can do nothing against natural disasters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Who do you think decides when and where fate takes us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The...gods?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Exactly. Without the power to match the gods, mankind will never achieve true peace themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>How can you say that?! The gods are the creators of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This may all sound like the ramblings of a madman to you, but I am not the first to try this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You don't mean..?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We remember them almost as though they themselves were gods; the founders of Alchemy, Nimul and Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>In their time, people regularly suffered from the devastation caused by natural disasters. Death was a constant occurrence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No matter how often they prayed, no matter what they sacrificed, the gods did not heed them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ultimately they chose to resist the merciless fate forced upon them by the gods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>They created Alchemy to become gods themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Their actions enraged the gods and everything came to an end with the destruction of the Tower of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I see this as proof that the gods felt threatened by mankind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Then your ideal world is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>With Alchemy perfected, mankind will no longer have to submit to the gods and can achieve true freedom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The world I strive for is one where people can protect themselves with the wisdom of Alchemy created by human hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I wish to rid the world of the gods, using the power of Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's crazy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>How can you not understand? I have no time to waste on petty squabbles among humans. I aim to confront the gods directly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>A time will come when mankind can stand as equals among the gods!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You're all the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If the weak must suffer for your ambitions, then you're no different from the gods with their natural disasters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You'll just be replacing the gods with yourself! That won't bring peace to anybody!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>There will always be casualties if one wishes to accomplish great things. This is a necessary culling of mankind via natural selection for the sake of the next stage of evolution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Only the chosen survivors of the coming catastrophe will be worthy of the peace I envision. Surely Nimul pictured the same future as I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>History has already given its answer to the idea of such a world, since it was never realized!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>And yet, the future Nimul imagined was righteous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Had Emmel not interfered, his ideals would have become reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Can't you see that if you follow in the footsteps of Nimul's ideology, then you are doomed to repeat his mistakes?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If you are the Vessel of Reincarnation for Nimul, then there is bound to be a Vessel of Reincarnation for Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You are destined to be defeated by someone who inherited the power of Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The Vessel of Reincarnation for Emmel? Ha...haha... Hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Wh-what's so funny?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Why do you think I destroyed Wadatsumi? You do not think it was simply for expansion of territory or for the Mikaboshi, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What do you mean? What other reason could there be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hmph. The only reason I attacked Wadatsumi was to eliminate Emmel's Vessel of Reincarnation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You weren't informed, were you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Captain Kagura's mother, the queen of Wadatsumi, carried the Mikaboshi within her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Eliminating her from the equation was the sole purpose of my invasion into Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I needed to keep the world in the dark, so my other superficial motives served as a convenient diversion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Y-you mean...K-Kagura's mother was the Vessel of Reincarnation for Emmel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yes. Unfortunately, I had not expected her to seal the Mikaboshi away somewhere, moments before her death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Not that it matters in the end. With her death, I obtained my objective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>So...there is no longer a Vessel of Reincarnation for Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Oh, good. Finally, you are coming to grasp the gravity of the situation. This attack has been planned for longer than you think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>The gears leading to this moment have been turning for over ten years, ever since Wadatsumi fell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Th-then if Nimul's soul returns now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>There is no one capable of standing in the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>The power of the Mikaboshi and the Matter have been neutralized; powers said to be comparable to that of the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Wratharis, Gluttony Foss, and Slothstein have yet to manifest the powers of their Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>The Sacred Stone of Lustburg is positioned high above in the sky, making it impossible to reach...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Leviathan of Envylia has been neutralized...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>And the Sacred Stone Lucifer is now in my hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I am now the only one in this world who wields any of the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>The Sacred Stone Mammon, within me, is the only place Nimul can return to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Can you feel it? It's Nimul's heartbeat. The soul of Nimul, the founder of Alchemy, has begun to take root!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I've already won, and there is nothing you can do to change that fact! Hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>No! How can this be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>There is no one left who can stop me! It is time... I will allow you to see this glorious moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>The world is ascending to a new plane of existence! Under my guidance, this world will leverage its new position to give us all a fighting chance against the gods!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>This is...wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>That is why you have cut down those who did not have the strength to defend themselves? All for this future that you have imagined for us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>What kind of future is that for anyone? None of us asked for this! This is wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Pathetic. The fact that you cannot accept reality even after it has been presented to you with a little bow is the embodiment of the weakness of humankind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You're wrong! Kindness, generosity, empathy, and support... You may call those things weak, but they're our greatest strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>There is no acceptable, sustainable future which can be built by sacrificing other people! That is not the path that we should take!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>As the Lord Commander, whose task it is to protect this world, I can never accept your way of thinking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I will stop you, Lion Monarch Orion! Your ambitions can never be fulfilled!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I will protect humankind from your cruelty. Humans deserve to have the dignity of being treated as human!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>How many times must I repeat myself? Why can't you get it into your thick skulls that this world is doomed? That your attempts to stop me are pointless?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>For those who lay claim to the seats of power in this world to be so dense is practically a sin in itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Fine, then! Let us test whether fate stands with you or I! We shall settle this dispute with our swords!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>The victor of this clash is the person who fate truly favors—the person who will lead us all into the future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>This Excalibur that I hold in my hand is the sword that will bring light to this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Its swing will clear the path forward for the people of this world! Excalibur, please lend me your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I was destined to guide humankind to greatness! Every step forward I take is a step for humankind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>No sword wielded by such short-sighted fools could ever stand up to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I will answer all of our prayers with one swing! Eternal Glow!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>The flow of history is on my side! Chaotic Genesis!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Urk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>This can't be... This strength...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I-if I were to fight alone...I might lose...but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I am not alone! I have been entrusted with something I carry with me always! I cannot lose with it on my side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Entrusted? Ha! With what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>The hopes of the comrades and friends that have fallen before me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>All of them strongly believed that you must be stopped! All of them are counting on me to do that in their stead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>My sword carries their wish for the fighting to stop! My heart carries the lamentations of those who have lost or been lost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Kanon is getting stronger?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>The true source of power is in the heart and soul. So long as I have the strength to believe in what I am doing, I can never lose to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Huuuzzzzzzzzzaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Unexpectedly, we are not entirely dissimilar. Your strength simply comes from a different source: the empathy you have for others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Wh-what is this strength?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Think of it this way... If your strength comes from the pain of this era, my strength draws on the unfulfilled needs of this era...and the last...and the one before that...all the way to the dawn of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>It is the strength built on the buried lamentations of the nameless masses who were crushed beneath the cruelty of fate since the beginning of time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>The force of their voices, suppressed for too long, is what makes me so powerful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Nnrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>The scale of the burdens we are carrying is completely different!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Until the lot of you get that through your heads, you'll never be able to win against me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>U-urk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Gnh... Don't think you can just push me down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>C-Captain Kudan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Fool! We have no choice but to destroy this man now, before he can destroy those who are vulnerable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>If we must die, we should do it here! We must fight with everything we have, until we have nothing more to give!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>You're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Finally... Nimul's soul has come to settle within my body!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>There is nothing that you can do to stop me! This is the end for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Hold nothing back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>I know! We have to put everything on the line here or there will be nothing to save, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Lord Commander! Embodiment of the world's so-called absolute justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>You, who represent the weaklings of the world... Destroying you is the first step to creating my new world!</td>
</tr>
