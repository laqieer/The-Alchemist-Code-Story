<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Haaa...haaaaa... I can't...do it. The Mecha Weapon isn't...dealing enough...damage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Unngghhh! The miasma! This is bad! Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What's that? The back of the Giant Taurus' neck is...glowing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Unnnnnggghhh!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Armed-Leap Assault!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrroooooooaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrgggggghhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Now! Get the miasma!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>H-huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Well? Did it work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Perfectly! I got a skin sample from the neck area, too! I'll go and examine it right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ah! The Giant Taurus is getting away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Stop! Victor! There's no need to be reckless! It'll come back, one way or another!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Got it?! So calm down, you idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You're the idiot! Idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Still kicking, Judith?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Thank the gods! It looks like we made it just in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Y-you! Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm sorry about before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I kept pushing myself too hard because I wanted to be the perfect Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I want to protect everyone that I possibly can. If I do that, I will be upholding the justice of the continent. That's enough for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Your father's blood is on our hands. Nothing can change that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But right now, defeating the Giant Taurus is our top priority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I want your help with that. No... I need it. This is something that only you can do. I'm counting on you, Judith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Wh-what's all this, all of a sudden?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If you'd said that just a little earlier, then my dad, h-he... He might not have...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I have no words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>All right! I figured it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You! When you attacked and cracked that bit off the Giant Taurus, I figured it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wh-what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What's with you?! This is fantastic! Where's Tehre?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Have you figured it out?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You bet I did! This bit that Tehre had, this piece that Judith cut off...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>And this last bit we just got our hands on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's all come together! There's absolutely no doubt about it! This neck part, you know, it's totally likeâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The Alchemia was particularly concentrated in those areas?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes! Exactly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I see! Thank you, Hange! This is going to have a huge impact on our effectiveness in battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Are you certain?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yes. With these materials, we should be able to... Hmmm. Judith?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>If the Giant Taurus is defeated, your father's hopes will be answered, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Tehre...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>There's no time to explain in detail, but if we destroy the core of the Giant Taurus, we should be able to defeat it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>There is no doubt about it: the core of the Giant Taurus is on its neck. Did you notice anything about it during the battle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Now that you ask... I remember that when the miasma was expelled, something on the back of its neck glinted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>That must be it! Then the core is on the back of its neck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Great! Now we know what to do! Weird that both the Titan and the Giant Taurus have the same weak point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I believe that we have also discovered how to send all of you back to your home world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You think it has something to do with the Giant Taurus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Yes, I do. In fact, I believe that it has something to do with specifically this Giant Taurus that is here in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Every time it roars, the air itself vibrates strongly in response.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Then, the Alchemia contained within the Giant Taurus' body is influenced by the vibrations of the air.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I suspect that is how the Titans were called here from another world. Those vibrations connected to another space and time and brought them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Why only this Giant Taurus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Recently, the balance of nature in Saga was torn asunder. As a result of that instability, both great and terrible things become possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Just talking about it is frustrating... I want to bring all this to a quick end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I don't understand how this is connected to sending them back to their world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>We must overwhelm the Giant Taurus' core with Alchemia and connect this world to theirs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It is very possible that in the process of returning to their world, they will lose their memories, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh? Is that some kind of multi-universe defense system or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>No, it's nothing like that. Simply put, once the balance is restored, all traces of the previous imbalance will be erased.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Ah. That makes sense. Well, that's only something to worry about once we've actually managed to connect our worlds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yes. Our first problem is figuring out how to best combat the Taurus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Judith, please, could you lend us your strength? There's no way we can do this without you and your Mecha Weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>That's the only way that we can stop this all now, before anyone else gets hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>B-but I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Don't you want to claim your father's justice by protecting that man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Reiner...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'm not a fan of the way you're manipulating me, but...I'll show you that I can take care of this with a swoosh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Whoa! That Titan is crazy huge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>We have no choice! We must figure out some way to deal with it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Look! That Titan's not our only problem!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What?! They multiplied?! What're we gonna do against this horde of giant monsters?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It's not over yet! Hey, everyone! Sorry to have kept you waiting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You came!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I did some tinkering using that miasma from the Giant Taurus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>The results of my experimentation mean that we can fight just like we always have! The ODM gear is back in the game!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Those hulking nuisances are from our world. It's our job to deal with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Listen. We'll deal with this Reiner ordeal later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>We need to handle your world's problems while in your world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>We'll settle things with Reiner once we're back in our own world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>There's no time! Judith!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Bud! Victor! We can't let them show us up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Eren, I authorize you to bring forth your Titan form. We just need to get through this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Got it! We're counting on you, Judith! Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Eren...is a Titan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>It's complicated. There's a lot going on in our world... Too hard to explain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Your job is to focus on being ready when the time comes to bring the Giant Taurus down. Take care of yourself until then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>It's our turn to show off!</td>
</tr>
