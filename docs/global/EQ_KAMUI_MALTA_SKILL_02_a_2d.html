<td>Gyarr?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huh. I think I've gotten a little rusty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What do you mean?! Miss Malta, that was amazing! I should have never doubted you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hehe. Now do you get it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah! I totally understand what they meant when they told me that I should never, ever make you mad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I understand that fear on a visceral level now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wait, who said that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ahem. Malta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes, Isidore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You're off the hook this time, but you are a druidic priestess. You're vital to this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's important that you not risk yourself when so many are relying on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But this was easy enough to do myself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's not what I'm talking about! Kamui, say something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Me? Uh, hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The precision of your Spiritbonding is brilliant, as always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I learned a lot from observing your techniques, such as your ability to sense the beasts before you could even see them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Not that! I'm trying to say we were worried!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No matter how strong you are, a single slipup and it could be the end for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Even though you're a master at Spiritbonding, you're still a woman, and I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If anything happened to you, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I think you're worrying too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>And what's wrong with that? I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What the...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The Chief has called an urgent meeting! He wants the three of you to gather immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>My father?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We'd better hurry. Can you take care of Hisham? I need you to take him home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What? But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>From here on, it's grown-ups only. Don't worry about it yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yeah, but what do you think could be so urgent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>They're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Sephira Guard Captain Isidore, at your service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Father, what's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The oracles have foreseen an outbreak of corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The incarnation of Beelzebub's curse, the Jams, have appeared?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Then it is our duty to eradicate them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Now is the time for us, the people of Sephira, to fulfill the duty entrusted to us so long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Where should we go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>At the eastern end of this southern region that our hidden village is located, there is what seems like the remains of a village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It is a long way from our village, but the fastest horse in the village can reach it in a day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I will gather our warriors immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No... It may be better not to bring so many people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>With the unrest in the royal capital and the uprisings in other regions, it would be a bad time for us to come to light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>We have already left the stage of history. Getting entangled in the troubles of the outside world may trigger new tragedies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>So then...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Malta and Kamui, I entrust to you two the task of purification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Please wait! I should also—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Isidore, what is the post that has been assigned to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...Captain of the Sephira Guard, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You cannot leave the village and your warriors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>In addition, you are to be the Chief of this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You understand the confusion it will bring if you abandon your duties for personal reasons, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I trust that with your skills, you two will need no extra escort. I leave the task in your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yes, father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'll go ask the stable master for horses!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Wait, I'll—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Isidore...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Take care of her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Like I said, no matter how skilled she is in Spiritbonding, she's not a warrior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I wish I could go with you and protect Malta with my own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>But that would force me to turn my back on the duties I have pledged to fulfill as a Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>So I'm leaving it up to you, my best friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>If anything happens, you protect her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>According to what the Chief said, the place filled with corruption should be just up ahead, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Malta, can you sense it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yes, I sense some distorted Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>It's...much bigger than I imagined...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Then let's purify the land first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>We'll use our skills to separate the Jams from the Alchemia of the earth to weaken them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Got it! Leave the purification to me. Kamui, synchronize with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Wait, Malta! They've already found us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Kamui, what do we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You purify the land! I'll take care of the Jams attacking us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I'm on it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>"I wield understanding in my right hand and mercy in my left. With the wisdom I have inherited, I will guide you to right the wrong—"</td>
