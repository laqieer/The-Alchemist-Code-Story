<td>A few days later...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Emmel! What're you doing over there? Penny for your thoughts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh, Mira...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Lately Nimul hasn't been coming down, not even to eat lunch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What? Is he holed up in the library again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes, I believe so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Whew! I'm impressed by his dedication. I know I couldn't do it! Why even come to a different region if all you're gonna do is study?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes, it worries me greatly. He's become far too focused on this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is the last of the books about magic in this building. I just...I'm a little concerned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>About what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You've been in here every day, up to your nose in books.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I thought you were planning to persuade that witch to help us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I am. This is how I am preparing for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I really don't see how this is supposed to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Waginau, these books...they carry the jewels of wisdom uncovered by the wise people of the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Kernels of knowledge that have already been mined, polished, and presented for the benefit of all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I have been consulting the greater minds of the past through these books in order to ready myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I see. I hope that they are of some help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Look, I have to go into town to pick up some items for Adaleigh and the others. Make sure you eat something, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Right. I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>So this is meant be the mockery of this town...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I did notice several oddities while we were being shown around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>People so preoccupied with love and matchmaking, the lack of technological development disproportionate to a town of this size...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This region should be more like ours, consumed by the corruption of the Cursed Beast, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I haven't seen a single Fallen since coming here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>How's it going, old dog?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Fine. I was a little taken aback by the idea of a furnace powered by magic at first, but I've gotten used to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Have you prepared the blueprints for the parts you need?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yep! From A-15 to C-7, right here... With these, we should be good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That said, I dunno if they can be made with something like a blacksmith's hammer. They're pretty high-level parts with very precise measurements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm not pleased with this, either. These are the only tools we managed to find, and it is rather disheartening. Still, we must at least try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yeah. Guess it is what it is. This is gonna take a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hey, you two mind if I watch?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Nyx?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I suppose not, but...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What're you hiding? Did your teacher send you here to spy on us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ambrosia? Hah! You don't have the right read on her at all. If she wanted to know what you were up to, she'd be the one here, getting into all of your business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Seriously? She sure is something...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I just, uh...well...it's been a while since there was someone around to talk to besides Ambrosia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I dunno. I just kinda thought it'd be nice to hang out or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh, right. You guys don't get out much, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Something like that... So, is it cool? You just keep doing your thing, and maybe we can chat a little while you work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Sure! As long as you're okay with the fact that I'll probably get distracted mid-conversation a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Haha! You're really excited about this, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I wanted to talk to Yna about Nimul, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>He seems busy. Perhaps I shouldn't bother him...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh...what am I doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Never mind. I'll just...take a nice walk and head back to Ambrosia's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oh! It's you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It's me! Do you not remember me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>O-oh...of course. We met the other day in town...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Just so! It was right over— Oh... Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm sorry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Forgive me for being so forward, but you look a little down. Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Oh! No, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I-I see. Well, if you ever need someone to talk to...I would offer my services, but perhaps you feel that I cannot be relied upon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>No, I...I simply feel a little uncomfortable, since we are essentially strangers, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Then let us become friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I spoke with some of the workers, and they suggested that I might have been a little overeager the last time we met. They proposed that I begin by offering friendship instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>So, if it is all right with you, please allow me to be your friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I-I'm very sorry, but I cannot accept your offer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>But why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Not that I have to explain myself, but I cannot afford to spare my attention to such things at present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Spare your attention? What does that have to do with anything? It is every living being's basic instinct to pursue that which will allow them to procreate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Wh-what?! People are not bound only by their instincts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Love is nothing so crude as that! It's gentle, yet bittersweet...at times a little embarrassing. It is the most beautiful, complex thing in the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>People...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Oh, I see. I see... I forgot myself, having met you for the first time. You must be a witch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Well, I suppose there's nothing for it. I apologize for my impertinence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Witches may not know love, correct? Witches who love can no longer exist as people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Wait, what? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Nngh! This is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Eeek?! Wh-what was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Please, head back to safety! The protection of this town is the last duty that remains to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Wh-what are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Wh-what's...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Whoa! What's with this shaking?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Adaleigh! Look to the north!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>North? Which way? What—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>It's...Asmodeus! Come to attack the town?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>No. It is here to look for humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You know something that you're not telling us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>There's no time to explain. The two of you need to get back to Ambrosia's place as soon as possible. You mind if we use Space-Time Manipulation? It'd be faster than—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>What are you saying?! If the Cursed Beast is here looking for humans, then the townspeople are in danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>We have to try and do something to repel the attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Our attacks may not be effective, but perhaps we can at least drive the Cursed Beast off. Let's go, Adaleigh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>No, see, that's going to end up causing more problems than it solves. Come on, listen to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Mira, can you hear me? Adaleigh and Yna have jumped into battle! Come help me stop them!'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Come help me stop them!'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Aw, man! What?! Come on, Nyx, what was the point of even sending you over there, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Hey, you didn't expect the Cursed Beast to pop up over here either!'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Well, wouldn't this be the perfect opportunity to show us what you're really made of, Nyx?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Anyway, guess there's nothing for it! I'll be right over. Hold down the fort!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Got it.'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>All right, so first of all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I feared as much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Whoa! Mister Nimul! What're you trying to do, give me a heart attack?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I apologize. However, this is an emergency, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Yeah, kinda? Well...seems like you already know what's up, so I'm just gonna come right out and say it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>It's too early for us to face the Cursed Beast. We are not done with our preparations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>That is why the people in town, my friends...we need to bring them back as quickly as possible, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Yes! Are you gonna help us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>While we're doing that, Ambrosia can work on finishing her part of the preparations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Understood. I will follow your lead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Thanks, Mister! First, let's go get Emmel and the white-haired dude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>White-haired...? Do you mean Waginau? His hair is actually silver, I believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>What?! He looks like some kind of wise man. I thought he'd just gone prematurely white!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Aaaaahhh! Th-the ice beasts have invaded our town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>N-no! Oh, no! It's so cold! So c-c-cold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Something strange is going on here. The townspeople are afraid of the Cursed Beast's ice beasts, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>They're not even paying attention to the actual Cursed Beast. I noticed that as well. How could they miss it? Is that even possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Oh, hey. New sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Trying to deal with the ice with a regular sword has been quite frustrating. Well, perhaps it wouldn't be so for a true swordsman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Unfortunately, I am but a humble blacksmith...but that means that I am able to constantly upgrade my weapons and armor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I see I am not the only one trying something new.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Yeah, well, my Engineer Soldiers are still back with the ship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>All I have is what I always carry with me, but...it's fine! It's all in how you use it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Seriously? You're just not going to listen to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Of course we are! Once we've taken care of this problem, we'll hear you out. Priorities, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Okay... I guess I should have seen that coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>We've got company!</td>
</tr>
