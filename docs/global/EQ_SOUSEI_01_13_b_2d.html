<td>Ngh... We got rid of the corruption, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh, no... The airship! It got flung so far away from the dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>If only we could bring it just a little closer...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Is that all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I had Adaleigh teach me the basic controls of the airship in the advent of an emergency. Unless I am very much mistaken, we have found ourselves in exactly such a predicament.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>O-oh! Yes! If you, um, please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>All right. I am...actually quite clumsy, so I'm not at all confident as to how this will go...but I'm sure it will be fine. In any case, let's give it a shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Um, Julia? What did you just say? You were mumbling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Nothing. Everything will be fine. I think this is the right one. Yes... Yes, it has to be this. All right. I'm going with this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It is a drastic measure, to be sure...but this is the only operation he taught me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>W-wait a second! I thought you said that—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Bam!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh...? That's strange...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What just happened?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm not sure...but it seems that the dragon is no longer moving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What the hell?! Why am I getting an emergency alert from the airship?! This is bad! This is really bad! It's already damaged!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No way! No freaking way! Don't tell me someone has rammed my ship into this dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Calm down, Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Calm down? Calm down?! How the hell am I supposed to do that?! If something's happened to my ship... I might not be able to go home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>And what about Emmel?! How do we know she's even safe?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Don't worry. The dragon isn't moving anymore, which means that it's being restrained by the Matter again. Without a doubt, Emmel is safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>R-right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But that doesn't change the fact that we must hurry. The final core awaits us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Unghh... Huh? I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Lady Emmel, you're finally awake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Forgive me. It seems I...might have botched the controls a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>J-just a little...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>In any case, now I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hrrngh! Arrrgh! Take...that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Uuhhh... Uuuhhhh... F-faaaaaall...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Fall! Fall to us! Fall! Fall! Fall! Fall! Faaall! Faaaaall! Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Th-the corruption...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Fear not, my lady. I will deal with them forthwith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>J-Julia...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Y-you're bleeding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>My wounds must have opened in the impact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The ones I sustained during my fight with the Black Knight... It appears that the corruption was applied to his blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I tried treating the wounds with my Spiritbonding, but to no avail. I'm not sure what else can be done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Then why...? Wh-why did you come with us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Because that is nothing less than my duty...and what I wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I wanted to protect you, my lady, and Lord Nimul as well. So long as I was of use... That is all I need to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No! Julia, if you use your purification powers with a wound like that, y-you'll...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Please don't make such a face. With this...my soul will remain intact. I can die without ever falling to the corruption of sin. There is no greater happiness in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>No! What are you saying?! You don't mean that! Y-you were meant to...t-take care of my brother...for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That was your wish, Emmel. Not mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hmhm... You cannot cleanse me of the corruption. It is too late. There is nothing that can be done for me now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Julia... If you come into contact with the Fallen... If you let the corruption fester...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Listen to me, my lady. You must make your own wish come true. After all... Isn't that what dreams are? Wishes that we must...fulfill...for ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Julia...? Julia! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>No... No! Wh-why...? Wh-why is this...happening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>All life is doomed to end in death. That is the inescapable truth...and the way of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Wh-who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Wh-what's going on?! I don't understand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Why is this happening?!</td>
