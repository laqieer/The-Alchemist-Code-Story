<td>Numaaa!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...! These aren't costumes! They are real monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>These monsters have infiltrated the town. Isn't that pretty bad? It might cause a panic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're right. Fortunately...everyone here is dressed up in a costume.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We need to chase the monsters out of town before the townsfolk realize. Let's try and talk with them first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hm...? Talk with them? How?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hmph. Don't underestimate me. I am Hayate from the honorable Gyobu tribe! I can understand the words of beast-type monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ah... That's...useful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Numaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...Huh? What's that? You still haven't fulfilled your goal yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Numa? Numa, numa, numu, numaaa...numa? Numaaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You've long been waiting for this moment and you can't afford to miss out on this opportunity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hey...are you really talking with them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Numaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wait! What exactly is your goal...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh dear, they're gone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>N-not good! We need to catch them before they cause a commotion! Elizabeth, Alexis! Let's chase them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I accepted the request of being in charge of the candy, but...I think making accessories is totally different from making candy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, I like working alone from home, so it's fine. Sigh... If only this time of peace would continue forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh... I finished making the candy. I guess I need to go and deliver them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ohhh. I really, really, really don't want to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Making candy is one thing, but I hate going outside! I don't want to go where there are crowds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...I guess I can't afford to be saying that. After all, I'm on a mission...and I was transmuted...sigh. I wish they would call me for missions where I can stay home the whole time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...Hm? There was a strange shadow at the window.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I wonder why Neica hasn't arrived yet. Do you think she's shut herself up indoors again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's possible. We're talking about Neica here. Wouldn't this kind of crowded festival be the kind of environment she'd want to avoid the most?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But that's not right! I don't like being in public places either, but I'm doing my best over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(She really gets passionate when it comes to Halloween.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We had quite a few incidences previously, as well, but it made me really happy to see everyone's smiles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I think that, if Neica saw those smiles in person, she would come to love Halloween!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...I hope so. Well, she should arrive soon. Hey...something's wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Numa! Numaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Something is surrounding the house... Are those...Rattys?! There are so many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Sigh... It looks like we've got our work cut out for us.</td>
