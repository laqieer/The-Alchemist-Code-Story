<td>I knew... We both made the decision together...but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I can't take it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Every time I look at that...gross insect...I think about how I should never have married him... Never had kids with him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I should have never had you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(No, she was wrong. Marriage is a beautiful thing, and happy families exist.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(Weddings bring true happiness. That is what I need to prove.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(That's why I decided to become Cupid.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Was she really wrong though...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Should...should I have never been born?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't say that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Lucretia, Uzuma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sure, your methods are a bit strong-handed Moa, but I'm sure there have been some who you've brought happiness to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah. Plus, you aren't wrong for wanting to make others happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Please don't say such things. Anyone who wishes so strongly for another's happiness, like you Moa, has to be a great person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're the one going around matching up couples all around Lustburg, aren't you?! Why are you doing this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's your fault the girl I love got together with another guy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>She'd still be single if it weren't for you! I had a chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You just had to get in the way, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This all feels...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>A little unjust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Unjust? Unjust?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Aha! There you are! Who is this guy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Your ridiculous Cupid act has stolen away my happiness! My goons will make you pay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You didn't have the courage to confess, and now you're asking for others to get revenge on your behalf. How pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Even if she hadn't come and played Cupid, I doubt that girl would have ever picked you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Shut your trap! Hey chief, show them what you've got!</td>
