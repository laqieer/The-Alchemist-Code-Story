<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Just a little bit more… We're almost there…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Our reward is nigh. All that we've accumulated will return to its original form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Its original form…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I see. That is what I agreed to. The future we desire requires the power to change the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's right! And soon, salvation will be ours. We'll make it so that this nightmare never happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What better way to wrap things up? And I'll finally be able to return there---</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…But you must wait your turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wha--!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I've been biding my time--waiting for the moment your exhaustion weakens your connection to the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…Is this Her Majesty's idea of a joke? Only I can activate this power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If I die, your plan to return the Ira Belt to its original state will be ruined!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yet, if I let you do as you please, we won't be saved either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It almost sounded too good to be true--turn back the clock, defeat the Cursed Beasts and nip all our suffering in the bud…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Perhaps, if I were as naïve as that youth, Nimul, I may have fallen for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>However, he and I are different. I see through your deceit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It…was never my intention to deceive. I never lied to you…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You just happened to omit certain details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Namely, if we go back in time to defeat the Cursed Beasts, we won't actually be saved, will we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We'll disappear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The Cursed Beasts created these lands. So, what would happen if they disappeared before they created anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Would that be "salvation?" Perhaps. In that scenario, mankind might build a utopian society on innocent soil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But…those people wouldn't be us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We are the children of a sinful earth. Our existence would be denied in your vision of paradise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>So, you intend to rob us of our future for a second chance at something you let slip through your fingers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>However, you don't get to decide what "time" we go back to… I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>…Ah, so you figured it out. Damn… I was hoping to avoid this little headache by keeping quiet…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What good will opposing me do you now? As far as the Ira Belt is concerned, this is checkmate. Game over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Even if you take me out…there's nothing you can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That's a lie. There are others who can use the same power as you. Two are here now, as a matter of fact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…Oh, so you plan on using those twins, is that it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What makes you think they'll do as you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm sure those two are busy rescuing the people of the Ira Belt as we speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>As humans, we get attached easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It doesn't matter what kind of person you are, if you take someone under your wing for long enough, you'll surely develop a connection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I've heard the cries of sorrow, the pleas for life, resounding near and far...and yet…I can't save them all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>…But those twins are willing to try. They'll go to any lengths to help others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>…Do my ears deceive me? Here I was thinking you abandoned your people without a second thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Or is this just another ploy to mess with their heads? What a devil you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So long as my land is saved, I'll employ any form of treachery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>ANY form of treachery, you say? Huh... So, that boy Sulva--is that why you sent him to do battle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>To pull at the heartstrings of the Pursuers…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>...You couldn't possibly understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>That child is our salvation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>A budding flower of hope, never before seen in the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>One born of this land fraught with Wrath, yet who is not motivated by anger--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>He shall lead our people toward a new age of peace and prosperity. I'm certain of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>But in order to do so, I had to make him a knight. There was no other choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>The "king" who rules this land must be stronger than anyone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>He must have the power to conquer our merciless terrain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>For that reason, I dared to send him into the fray. He needed to learn that kindness is not always enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>How ghastly… Poor thing had no say in the matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Still, he may find salvation if he rebels against you, but I seriously doubt that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>…How could he do otherwise when he owes you his life? Your cunning is truly remarkable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>The question is…is there any hope beyond that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>…Enough idle talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Your machinations end now, snake. I'll be taking over from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>…Meet your maker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>…We're approaching the summit. Mira, Nyx. How's everything looking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So far, so good! Making sure we don't get attacked by Space-Time Manipulation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We can't let that jerk keep beating us. Master would give us a tongue-lashing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Alright, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>…What…the--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The heat and corruption are unbearable…This must be Satna's stronghold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And yet the Cursed Beast is nowhere to be found… Quence! Show yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>…He's gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>…Queen Terese?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What do you mean "he's gone?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Just that. By now, his body should be no more than ashes in the crater.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>…Did you have some kind of falling out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Yes, I suppose that's how it must look to you. Here--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Libra!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I believe this is yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>…Why the sudden change?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Think of it as an olive branch... To new allies. In return, all I ask is that you save this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…You want us to use Libra to go back in time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Precisely. Go back to the time our prized knight, Andechs, left us and my brother succumbed to sin. That was when this land began to crumble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If you defeat Satna while it's still dormant, then maybe the Ira Belt can be saved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Maybe those of my people who you couldn't save before will escape ruin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But that's…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Mira, Nyx. Is it even possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>…Given the amount of magil they loaded into Libra…it's possible. In theory, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>But who knows what would happen to the present if we go changing the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I'm willing to take my chances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>If the alternative is certain doom, it's a worthwhile gamble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>So? Can I count on you? The power to save the world is in your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>A miraculous power that will right the wrongs of the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>We…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Sorry, we're not interested.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Andechs! You made it…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>…What brings you here, knight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Did you not sully your hands to save this land?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Why do you oppose our salvation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Simple--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>If we follow your plan, our "sins" will vanish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Our "sins?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>We chose to make sacrifices at our own volition. We showed little regard for others and shed blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>We can't pretend that didn't happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>We've got to carry those sins on our shoulders. Even if it's painful---even if we have regrets--that's the only way forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Andechs…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>…I second that. I don't wanna rewrite the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Adaleigh…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I'm saddened about opposing Icona and letting her die. There were many others I wish we could've saved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>But if I did it all over again like it never happened--that just wouldn't be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I've also thought about going back in time, once or twice. But y'know…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>That pudding I ate yesterday was special because I could only eat it once. Mmmmm--just thinking about it makes my mouth water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You're saying you'd go back in time for pudding? I think there's a point in there…somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>We all have times we'd like to do over. But why place your bets on a method with no guarantee of success? For now, at least…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Mira… Nyx…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I just accept things as they are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>…Me too! I want to live without regrets!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Eulalia…Daphne…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>…Life is full of struggles. We make mistakes and we get hurt…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>But we do the best we can. I'm sure every living thing does the best it can...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Emmel…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>…Is this the conclusion you've reached?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>…It appears so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>We've come this far fighting to build a brighter future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>And we'll keep fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Very well…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Your Majesty, I…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I'm alive. I'm still alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>That means we haven't failed. The Ira Belt isn't finished. So…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You’ve made your decision clear. Our goals are at odds. I fear I have no choice--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>In accordance with the creed of this land, my strength will show you the error of your ways!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>…! Everybody, brace yourselves!</td>
