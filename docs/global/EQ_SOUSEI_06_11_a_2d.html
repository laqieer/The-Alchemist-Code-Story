<td>Just a little bit more… We're almost there…</td>

<td>Our reward is nigh. All that we've accumulated will return to its original form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>Its original form…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>I see. That is what I agreed to. The future we desire requires the power to change the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>That's right! And soon, salvation will be ours. We'll make it so that this nightmare never happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>What better way to wrap things up? And I'll finally be able to return there---</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>…But you must wait your turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Wha--!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>I've been biding my time--waiting for the moment your exhaustion weakens your connection to the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>…Is this Her Majesty's idea of a joke? Only I can activate this power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>If I die, your plan to return the Ira Belt to its original state will be ruined!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>Yet, if I let you do as you please, we won't be saved either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>It almost sounded too good to be true--turn back the clock, defeat the Cursed Beasts and nip all our suffering in the bud…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>Perhaps, if I were as naïve as that youth, Nimul, I may have fallen for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>However, he and I are different. I see through your deceit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>It…was never my intention to deceive. I never lied to you…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>You just happened to omit certain details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>Namely, if we go back in time to defeat the Cursed Beasts, we won't actually be saved, will we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>We'll disappear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>The Cursed Beasts created these lands. So, what would happen if they disappeared before they created anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>Would that be "salvation?" Perhaps. In that scenario, mankind might build a utopian society on innocent soil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>But…those people wouldn't be us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>We are the children of a sinful earth. Our existence would be denied in your vision of paradise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>So, you intend to rob us of our future for a second chance at something you let slip through your fingers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>However, you don't get to decide what "time" we go back to… I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>…Ah, so you figured it out. Damn… I was hoping to avoid this little headache by keeping quiet…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>What good will opposing me do you now? As far as the Ira Belt is concerned, this is checkmate. Game over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Even if you take me out…there's nothing you can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>That's a lie. There are others who can use the same power as you. Two are here now, as a matter of fact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>…Oh, so you plan on using those twins, is that it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>What makes you think they'll do as you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>I'm sure those two are busy rescuing the people of the Ira Belt as we speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>As humans, we get attached easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>It doesn't matter what kind of person you are, if you take someone under your wing for long enough, you'll surely develop a connection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>I've heard the cries of sorrow, the pleas for life, resounding near and far...and yet…I can't save them all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>…But those twins are willing to try. They'll go to any lengths to help others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>…Do my ears deceive me? Here I was thinking you abandoned your people without a second thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Or is this just another ploy to mess with their heads? What a devil you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>So long as my land is saved, I'll employ any form of treachery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>ANY form of treachery, you say? Huh... So, that boy Sulva--is that why you sent him to do battle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>To pull at the heartstrings of the Pursuers…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>...You couldn't possibly understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>That child is our salvation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>A budding flower of hope, never before seen in the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>One born of this land fraught with Wrath, yet who is not motivated by anger--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>He shall lead our people toward a new age of peace and prosperity. I'm certain of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>But in order to do so, I had to make him a knight. There was no other choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>The "king" who rules this land must be stronger than anyone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>He must have the power to conquer our merciless terrain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>For that reason, I dared to send him into the fray. He needed to learn that kindness is not always enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>How ghastly… Poor thing had no say in the matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Still, he may find salvation if he rebels against you, but I seriously doubt that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>…How could he do otherwise when he owes you his life? Your cunning is truly remarkable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>The question is…is there any hope beyond that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>…Enough idle talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>Your machinations end now, snake. I'll be taking over from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>…Meet your maker.</td>
