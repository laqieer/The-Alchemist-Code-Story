<td>011</td>
<td>Spica!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You... You didn't even try to protect yourself. Is this man so important to you?</td>

<td>It seems that Greed Dike's army has begun its siege.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I must...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Must what? You cannot do anything until you get past me...and you won't.</td>

<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No. Acht, Neun... You go reinforce the Greed Dike army. I will wrap up our business here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What are you trying to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We have to take advantage of this moment and destroy the Holy Guard's strength from the inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Is it not also our duty to clear the path for our master before he arrives?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So...you're just going to take all of these people on yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Look at them. Do you think I will have a problem with two wounded ghosts and a single Lord Commander surrounded by little girls?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I suppose you have a point. There's no real need for all three of us to be here. Shall we go, Acht?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It is our duty to attend to such matters before Sol arrives, but... Hmph. Well, even something such as this must be within your abilities.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>N-neither Zahar nor Captain Cadanova could defeat him in a sword fight! There's no way I can do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmph. I don't even need to bother crossing swords with you. You're done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>B-behind me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I have a lot of other things to do today, so if you don't mind, I'd like to start getting to them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Mistress!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ngh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You used your own body to protect her... What a waste of effort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova! Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Urgh... I can't believe you learned nothing from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Did I waste my time with you? What are you doing shaking in your boots like a child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Kanon... This is your final test. If you are truly a Paladin of the Holy Guard, forget everything but what you need to protect the peace of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Forget everything but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It is not only strength that determines the outcome of a battle, but also heart! You should know this as the Lord Commander!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's...right... Captain Monzein, Captain Yauras, Captain Othima, and Seida, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>They trusted that I would do this... That I would take all that they have done, and stand strong in the face of destruction!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ack... I let my guard down, but...I've got this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I don't know what to do with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Suzuka, hurry to the Royal Palace! I need you to go reinforce the Emperor's guard! The enemy is probably making their way onto the palace grounds as we speak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What?! Mistress, what are you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'll be fine! I won't lose to the likes of him! Believe me!</td>
