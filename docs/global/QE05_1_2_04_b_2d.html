<td>"Sephiron, our great Mother, the Tree of Life, crowned supreme; we who pass into temptation, beyond the tertium sephirah, beyond the crossroads."</td>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Grr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I-Is it over?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes. I believe so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I see... So the regrets and anguish of those who attempted to protect Hisham that day were partially absorbed into his Alchemia, which resulted in Sephiron calling him here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Then the Jam just now were the result of Beelzebub's curse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes. However, the altar has returned to its usual purified state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Um... I'm sorry, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You were not at fault. To feel pain is normal. The burden you now carry... I am sorry that it is so heavy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Kamui, I... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hisham?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He's fine. He just needs some rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's...good to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You did well, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Chief?! I-I must apologize for such a ruckus near our sacred altar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There is no need. I have seen for myself what happened here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Malta, take Hisham back to his home. Kamui and I still have some things to discuss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Understood. Hisham?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Uhm, mmhm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I see. So it was Hisham's grief that affected Sephiron so greatly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Affected...? What happened, Chief? I have never heard of such a thing happening before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You wouldn't have. That is the secret darkness that Sephiron holds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Only those trusted to be the head of the tribe are trusted with this information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Kamui, you are aware that Sephiron has powers of purification, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes, and that its power suppresses the curse of Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Therefore, we of the Sephira tribe have hidden ourselves and protected Sephiron for generations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes. That is correct. However, there is also a dark side to this story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Sephiron wields the power of purification, which means she has the ability to identify and purify evil and corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>However, there are some things that Sephiron cannot purify.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Such as...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No matter how pure or just, there are none who do not hold the potential for darkness within their hearts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That deep sadness carved into his heart, the lingering regret... This combination threw Hisham's Alchemia into a frenzy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Then, when he touched Sephiron, the purification powers of the great tree were corrupted into emitting misfortune instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This is a result of Hisham's distorted Alchemia reacting to the curse of Beelzebub buried deep within Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>So that is what caused this upheaval?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yes. Any great quantity of Alchemia is enough to transform this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We, the Sephira, are able to control this phenomenon with our Spiritbonding, to a certain extent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>However, Hisham has not been trained the way we have. He does not yet know what he can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The despair within him must have awakened the darkness sleeping within Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Something that has been the source of blessings for our village has perhaps become...a liability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>However, our duty includes returning Sephiron to her original state in times like these.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That is what it means to be the Protector of Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ah... I believe I remember Isidore's father Judah saying something like that about his role as Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yes, but he did not finish training a successor before he died saving my beloved Malta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And unfortunately, Isidore was not suited for such a role, so I had thought that perhaps this would be the end of the Protectors...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>However, considering his instruction of you, it seems he saw that you would be able to take on the burden of Protector in his stead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You impressed me with how you dealt with the curse just now. I did not see only Kamui, I saw the Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You have proven yourself to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>There is only one who is capable of connecting to the decimum sephirah and making use of the full potential of the sephirah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>They bear the mark of one who has been chosen by Sephiron, their proof of having been chosen as Emmel's successor. Judah had the same mark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I...? The successor of Emmel...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>For one such as you, born to a distant relative of ours, to be saved by Judah that day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I still remember the look in Judah's eyes when he informed me we would be taking you in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Perhaps it was Sephiron herself that led him to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>That is why I have entrusted so many tasks to you that led you to the outside world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>All so that you would be prepared to take on the role of protecting this village, and so protect the stability of this place which safeguards Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Yes, but...I am yet inexperienced and unprepared in many ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You understand, do you not, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hisham witnessed the darkness of Sephiron. This makes it clear that Sephiron is currently unstable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>If his heart wavers again, it is possible that Sephiron may respond the same way she did today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>When that happens, if Sephiron cannot be purified, Beelzebub's curse will overwhelm the great tree and this land will begin to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>If we are to take that boy into our village, we must have someone to subdue the curse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You have only one of two choices. Either succeed the role of Protector, or be prepared for Hisham to be expelled from the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Those are my only choices?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Which will you choose? I will allow you to take some time to consider this, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
