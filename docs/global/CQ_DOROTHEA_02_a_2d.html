<td>Fine, whatever... You know, you talk an awful lot.</td>

<td>The next time I buy a doll, I'm thinking about naming it after you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What a weirdo. My name is Aswald. Happy now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wow, I didn't think you'd tell me. Was it because you were tired of dealing with me...and you thought it'd be the more efficient route?</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>In any case, I plan to dispose of you once we reach the surface. Now hurry up. If we fall behind, we'll be surrounded by monsters.</td>

<tr>

<td>So, they've snuck in from a safe place after all. They're trying to excavate a Demon and sell it off as a weapon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>A-a Demon?! That big fella? As in to use in war? They're weapon merchants?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Not everyone is as naive and simple-minded as you are.</td>

<td>Boss! There's someone behind the shadow of that pillar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The style and color of that hair... Is that you, Dorothea?! Are you...attempting to hide?</td>

<td>Your head is protruding from behind the pillar! Hahahah!</td>
</tr>

<td>028</td>
<td>...Why did you come to battle with such an excessive hairstyle?</td>

<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No one asked for your advice! We just need to defeat them, right?!</td>

<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Your simple-minded way of thinking mirrors your simple-minded way of fighting. Try and think a little more before acting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What? Umm...do you mean I should play hard to get with him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>When did this conversation become about your love life?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>For me, all is the same in love and war! ...But, you're right, playing hard to get is important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...Sigh. Don't get in my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Right back at you!</td>
