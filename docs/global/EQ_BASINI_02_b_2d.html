<td>What?! She took my strike on purpose...to create an opening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Have you forgotten? I feel no pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Pain and resolve alike only hinder me. They are meaningless before the order I am sworn to defend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>She always did fight with no regard for her own life. All that ever mattered to her was eliminating her target.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>In the old days that made her a powerful ally, but now it makes her a deadly foe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Try as you might, you cannot defeat me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I wouldn't be so sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(Why? Why are you so...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You've changed, Basheeny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Does that hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's just a souvenir from my last mission. It doesn't bother me anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You're lying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hah. I should have known I could never fool you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>These wounds stem from your doubts and your hastiness. You must kill such emotions, lest they hinder your mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Unless, of course, you plan to abandon Corpse...and follow your most recent targets to the grave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Why would I do that? Running away wouldn't solve anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>My targets turned against Corpse because their mistaken resolve led them astray.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>They misunderstood their roles. We of Corpse exist only to serve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So you do understand. There is hope for you yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You know, I could get used to hearing you say that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That is another lie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Got me again, eh? You always could see right through me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You may deceive others, but you will never fool me. I can sense the resolve of others. Remember that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You were right to say that resolve undermines order. Those who seek to protect the world's order have no need of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I only hope I can be like you someday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Now that you understand what you must do, you need only to put it into practice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>(I really can't sense any resolve from her at all...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>There is no need to dwell on things so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Pain, sorrow, hesitation, doubt... They mean nothing before the absolution of order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Nor does life, if it comes to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Human resolve lies at the root of all chaos and conflict. The world has no need for individual will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I can sense my own resolve inside me...and I cannot stand it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>All I desire is to follow in your footsteps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>There is no need to dwell on things so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Perhaps you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(So he still can't wield Excalibur's power fully...and that's the least of his problems.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>As long as your resolve persists, your attacks are as clear as day to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ungh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You truly have changed, Basheeny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>And you are the same as ever. Do you still consider Corpse a necessary evil, even now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Good and evil are not my concern. It is the preservation of order that I serve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>And does crippling the Holy Guard help to preserve order?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>So long as the world remains in balance, the truth of it justifies our actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Irene!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Besides, in your current state, you are unworthy to be Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You might be right, but I still have no intention of stepping down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Human resolve is what safeguards this world. My friends entrusted me with their resolve...and I won't betray it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Your ideals are a falsehood. You hold proof of that in your own two hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>How can a Lord Commander protect the order of Babel when he cannot even wield his own sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>If human resolve is truly worthy of safeguarding the world, why does Excalibur not answer your call?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I will trade no more words with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You are unworthy of the title of Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>If I judge you a threat to the balance of law and order, through incompetence or otherwise, I will eliminate you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Irene!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Let's go, Carlotta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I know my own shortcomings only too well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>If we faced them in our current state, could we survive? If only I could draw out Excalibur's true power, maybe I could find a way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Your ideals are a falsehood. You hold proof of that in your own two hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>How can a Lord Commander protect the order of Babel when he cannot even wield his own sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Excalibur... The symbol of absolute justice, and a means of pacifying the Alchemy of Power should the Alchemy of Compassion ever be lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>A treasure bequeathed from Emmel, the founder of Alchemy, to the Lord Commander, the supreme judge, so that they might keep the balance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Or so Lord Zain's notes claim. Although that, too, is drawn from Captain Kaya's observations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>And yet I am still unworthy of wielding it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>If human resolve is truly worthy of safeguarding the world, why does Excalibur not answer your call?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I know full well that I will never be Commander Kanon's equal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>But I refuse to believe resolve is meaningless. I have seen its worth with my own eyes. I have been inspired to follow in its wake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>If I fall here, the last of my friends' resolve will die with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>And that I cannot allow.</td>
