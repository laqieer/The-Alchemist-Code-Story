<td>Hey... I saw something just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Eeek. It really is a ghost... Actually, it's more like the Grim Reaper.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's not just any ordinary monster. Be careful, Mia.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>O-okay.</td>

<td>Something smells strange.</td>

<td>Huh? Elizabeth... Have you already figured it out?</td>

<td>Poison? No, it's more like a medicine... Maybe it's a monster who uses a sleep agent?</td>

<td>Oh also... Don't you think we should keep that child under observation?</td>

<td>Are you a doctor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ehem. Anyway, it can't be helped. We have to take out that monster. Let's go, Mia.</td>
