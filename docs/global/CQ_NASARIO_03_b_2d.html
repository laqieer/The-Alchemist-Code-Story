<td>Ah, I can hear his music! I should go and see him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Leon. You came back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ah, you're that high-elfâ€”Nasario, was it? You came all the way out here to see me, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes. Your music has a very unique sound, so I knew it was you right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What instrument is that? I've never seen anything like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is the most recent addition to my collection. It has an interesting history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It is said that whoever plays this instrument will stub their little toe on the corner of a dresser.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>And has that happened to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Not yet. I'm looking forward to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You are a very odd man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You seem like the type of fellow who is always visiting different cities and towns. Tell me, bard, why do you strum away at instruments?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You've decided to start listening to what others have to say, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I felt that it was something that I ought to do. The last time we met, I was...arrogant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I meant to show you pity, yet I did not consider your feelings at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So, now you want to ask me questions. Is that it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>An elf with true pride does not show one-sided pity. Rather, they do what they can to understand the other party's circumstances, the better to show them compassion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hmph. I suppose it can't be helped that I'm pitied.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>For a half-blood like me, even going into a human town causes shame. It makes you feel inferior for having elf blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is that why you come to this forest to perform?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It is. On the day we met, I came here to play my new instrument.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The forest is nice and quiet. Maybe the reason I like it here so much is because of my elf blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>However, if my music is offensive to the high-elf ear, then I suppose I will have to find somewhere else to perform.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>There is no need for you to leave this place. Nobody will... Well, I suppose that is not something that I can guarantee, but at the very least I will not deny you this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I should like to hear your music more. Would that be all right with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I hit my tambourine once... That means yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I expect a noble high-elf like you can remember something as simple as that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Give that to me for a moment, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>There! Now I have hit the tambourine once, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I see. I guess you pick things up a little faster than others do, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Thank you. Your words warm my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I always believed that the noble timbre of the forest could not be rivaled by anything, let alone the music of man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>There is still more that I wish to know about you. I want you to let me hear your melody.</td>
