<td>So this is that greedy noble's mansion, huh?</td>

<td>Listen up, you lot. I'm going to need you to draw the guards' attention to the front of the estate. Pretend to be peddlers, and find a way to buy me enough time to slip in through the back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I've scoped out their patrol roster, and the rear guards are due to switch out any moment now. That's all the opening I need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You sure that'll be enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You've seen how fast I am, haven't you? You really think I can't make it? That's what I thought.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Anyway, my first order of business will be to find out if you've told us the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Then, when I give the signal, I want you to join me, Icona. I'll try to hold my own in the meantime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Understood. Show us what you can do, Ishuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well, well. There are just as many guards on the inside. Wouldn't you know it, this place is starting to stink of...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>What's that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Get a move on! I need another two hundred of those baubles ready to send out before the end of the day!</td>

<td>Once the Winter Holiday is over, they won't sell for a premium anymore! They'll be worthless trash!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(The bandits were telling the truth! Look at all these poor people, shut up in that awful man's dungeon! Hold on, everyoneâ€”I'm coming to rescue you!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What's this?! How did you get in here, whelp?! Guards! We have an intruder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Uh-oh!</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Icona!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I might not be as quick as you, but I can still be pretty fast when I want to be, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You sure can! Thanks, Icona! I owe you one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't mention it. Let's finish this together, shall we? That would be the most efficient way to proceed.</td>
