<td>Hah! Yah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ila, learn to take advantage of your small stature to fight more efficiently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hold your breath and wait for the right moment. Watch your target's habits and anticipate their next move. Lend an ear to the whispers of your inner darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ugh! J-just shut up! As if I have time to be doing all that! Take this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Honestly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Rraaaaaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ila, do not let your rage control you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You are no use on the battlefield if you cannot control your Alchemia because you lost yourself in rage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Urgh... Dammit...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(Good grief...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(Still... Ila is definitely becoming stronger.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(At least compared to how she simply flailed around when she first started.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What are you smiling about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ahh, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(Tell me, Evil Eye. What is this sense of exaltation I feel?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(My heart is drowned in darkness. It shouldn't be so easily made aflutter.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(That's right. My heart has been filled with darkness since the day I was born to that abominable family.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>From the moment I was born to the Leonhearts, a family of assassins, my days of eternal nihility had begun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Unless I killed people as commanded, I was not considered a member of the family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But the more I killed, the less I felt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Atop the pile of bodies I created, there was nothing left. Everything faded away, even the sensations immediately after killing a person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If I lived my life as a Leonheart and nothing else, I realized I would leave nothing of myself behind. I found that to be terribly empty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>—vus! Corvus!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Corvus! Hey! Are you even listening to me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I am. You really are a noisy one. Have you ever tried lending yourself to the silence of darkness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You really have to stop spouting nonsense like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Do you have a minute, Corvus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Letitia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh, I'm sorry. Was I interrupting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No, we were just finishing up here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I see... Hehe, you two sounded like you were having so much fun, I almost thought I was hearing a family on vacation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>A family...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Wh-wha—?! Who would want to be related to this guy?! You can't be serious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I just want to beat him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh my.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(A family? Heh, the one thing I'm not suited for.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Dammit... Why is he so strong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Well, of course he is. Corvus used to be a very skilled assassin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Seriously? He was?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hehe. It is a great privilege to be taught the art of assassination by one of the Leonheart family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Letitia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh, what is the matter? Is your family and work truly deserving of such antipathy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh, you're more impressive than I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That's all in the past. I'm not part of that family anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I got sick of the seemingly endless days of killing. So I left that family behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Killing is what an assassin does, so I killed every day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I spoke death and fulfilled my own prophecy, taking lives until it became as easy as breathing in and out. A daily chore, just a normal day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I gradually came to feel nothing when taking a life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Corvus? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>No. It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What brings you here, Letitia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I wished to discuss something with you. Regarding the search for that particular tome...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Do you mean the tome written by the director of the Wratharis Research Laboratory?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I do. That tome alone was taken from the director's secret room.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The only ones who had access to that room were the director and a researcher assigned to be their assistant, and the latter seems to be missing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Very well. I shall consult my abominable and dark connections and see what I hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You're speaking nonsense again! This is a quick search for a missing person, right? If that's the case, I can—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>No. You are not coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>The darkness within whispers to me...that you are not yet ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>What?! How am I not ready?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You have yet to successfully hit me once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Urgh! Then, right now! I'll show you what I can do! I'll give it my all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hah. As if you haven't been trying until now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Sh-shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Argh! I just can't stand you! I can't stand you at all!</td>
</tr>
