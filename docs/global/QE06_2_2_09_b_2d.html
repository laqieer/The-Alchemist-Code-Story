<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>…Kaede is with a human?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's just a rumor…but there may be some truth to it, given recent events.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm bringing Kaede back. There must be some mistake…She'd never be with a human. She might be in a weakened state or in trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Nothing…you may be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...?! Why is that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We could use this opportunity to glean information from the humans. The important thing is that the demons win in the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And you want to use Kaede for that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Often the opening moves determine the match.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Even we demons are exhausted from the human onslaught. Some are beginning to doubt whether or not we can survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We won't allow them to win!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Of course, I feel the same as you do. However...the arts of Phoenix Brigade…and the Kagutsuchi pose a serious threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That damned art…someday I will destroy it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>When? Today? Or tomorrow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>…Well--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We have to admit it. They've driven us into a corner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Tch...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In fact, some people are happy that Kaede is fraternizing with humans… They think it will lead to peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Peace?! Have they forgotten what the humans did to us...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>They toyed with our lives time and time again...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Where was this rage before--when we needed it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I've always had it!.. I swear I will destroy the entire human race!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Nothing changes with words alone. The sacrifices we've made thus far are due to your own incompetence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Until you admit your weakness, there will be no path forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Only the strong survive... If you want the world to kneel before you, you must wield that power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If you hesitate to show your strength, it may be too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>…………</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I haven't been able to devour humans of late… This is the harm it has wrought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>…The wound you received from Kagutsuchi still hasn't healed…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Human eyes are watching us wherever we go. In order to devour people, we need to address this issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So, it may be a good thing that Kaede is visiting with humans…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Don't tell me--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Are you suggesting we surrender to the humans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>No, not in the least. But...I think it might be better to proceed without fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>If we don't fight…how can we destroy them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'm simply suggesting we avoid fighting in a weakened state. We cannot afford any more losses on our side…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>If we are wiped out before we can eradicate the humans and build a kingdom of demons, all will be for naught.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>…In any case, I want to see how this situation with Kaede develops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...I pray it's not too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>..! What the hell have I been doing…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>…Endangering Kaede… Overlooking the wounds of the Discarnate Power…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I know what I have to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Now then…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Let us see which way the wind blows… I’m interested to find out.</td>
