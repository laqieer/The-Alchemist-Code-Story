<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Thank you... I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You must be tired from working all day...yet here you are, waiting late into the night for me to come home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>K-Kazahaya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Go home and rest already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Thanks for telling me not to come home. Bye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Kazahaya! Wait! Why are you being like this?! If you want to come home, I—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I came here because I have something I want to do... Something I have to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Does that have something to do with the way you've been acting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I found something that's more important than protecting our village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What? Did you get yourself a girlfriend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No! Tch... I've joined a cause. I'm trying to protect something bigger than just us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I won't let you help me anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>S-so that's what this is all about, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I do want to protect you, and our village. I mean that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But...I also want to give everything I have to help Lord Zain achieve his goals—even my life, if need be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If that happens, you'll be all alone, won't you? When I think about that, I can't bring myself to do it. I can't dedicate myself to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hehe. I guess I was acting a little like an overbearing parent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>All right. I understand. Even if you end up getting yourself killed, I won't be sad. So you don't have to worry about me, or the village, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Tch. Somehow, I doubt that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I guess this means that you'll be working for the Holy Guard someday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, it'd be one step towards repaying my debt to that kid who saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmmm... He did help us escape to the safety of this village, so I don't blame you for feeling like you owe him. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You can fawn over Lord Zain all you want, but I don't want you to end up like that lancer boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I knew you were going to say that. There was so much melancholy to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I know how you feel, but...he's not someone you should aspire to be. Just be you, okay? And come home once in a while!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Tch. Get off my back, would you? Bye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Heheh. Look's like he's all grown up now. He's gotten strong enough to carry a burden as heavy as the fate of the world on his shoulders. It makes me feel a little lonely, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, as they say in Wadatsumi—you gotta send off a young man on his first journey with a smile!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I need to do my best, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Kazahaya! You little punk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If you don't outlive me, I'll make your afterlife hell!</td>
