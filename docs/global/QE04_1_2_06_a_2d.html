</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The Jam are referred to as writhing abominations. First, they eat their way into your body causing terrible pain...</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ultimately, their corrupted soul destroys your flesh completely.</td>

<td>How horrible! Mocca, were you inflicted with that curse?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes. But, don't worry. The Sprite should know how to remove the curse.</td>

<td>He told me that dragons, who can only live in the purist of places, live in Saga. He said that I might be able to find a way to remove the curse here.</td>

<td>I want to do everything that I can to find a cure...so that the men and women of Lustburg can live together!</td>

<td>You still can't let your guard down? Don't you understand that she's not even from this country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's nothing to do with that. I haven't eaten anything in a while. I can't help it that I'm hungry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, that's right! Here. Eat this!</td>

<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I think it's a foreign sweet. How about you take some?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...It doesn't contain poison, does it?</td>

<td>Do you think she likes it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
