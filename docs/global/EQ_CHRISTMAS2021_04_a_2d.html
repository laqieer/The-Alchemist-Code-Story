<td>Numa!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey, are you ok? Are you hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I-I'm ok... I got surrounded by those numa numa guys, but they didn't hurt me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Numa numa... How strange... Do you think they were trying to communicate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Mer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>More importantly, what were you thinking heading into the forest alone like that!? </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There are always more decorations, but there's only one of you! How could you do something so reckless!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Do you have any idea how worried I was!? Not to mention the trouble you put these guards through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...Hang on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I understand how you must feel, but you should listen to what your son has to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>And you... Don't just clam up. You need to tell your dad exactly how you feel. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...I wanted us to make the snow sculpture together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But you just did everything yourself. You told me to just watch, but... I wanted to make it together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I know you were doing it to try to win the contest for me, so I didn't want to say anything. But when I heard the decorations never arrived...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I just thought that if I brought them back, then we could finish it together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...Even I could tell how dejected you felt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's so sad to be left alone like that, even if someone is doing it for your sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I...had no idea that's how you felt. I was just so focused on the sculpture, I completely ignored your feelings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I know how much you love things from the Maruda Tribe. When I heard about the prize for the contest, I guess I got carried away trying to win it for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I know I'm always so busy with work that I never have enough time for you. I just thought that if I got you the perfect present, then I could still show you how much I care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But I just ended up pushing you away instead.  I should have paid attention to how I was making you feel. I'm so sorry, Son.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Papa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...But come on. We need to get back to town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yeah, you should. I want to take a look around here and then we'll head back too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>There are other guards patrolling the forest, so the two of you should be safe to head back on your own. Be sure to take some time and talk things through on your way back too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...I'm glad they could work it out. You can really tell how much they care for each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yeah, me too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But even so, they still ended up having problems. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I guess they did...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>They were both thinking of each other, but because they didn't communicate, they ended up hurting one another. It seems almost unfair...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I guess it just goes to show why it's so important to communicate your feelings and try to understand the other person's feelings too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The other person's feelings...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No distractions. Come right back when you're done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...You just won't tell me anything, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I know I'm always so busy with work that I never have enough time for you. I just thought that if I got you the perfect present, then I could still show you how much I care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But I just ended up pushing you away instead.  I should have paid attention to how I was making you feel. I'm so sorry, Son.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...You're pretty amazing, Ravi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Huh? I am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Talking about things is hard. But you understood right from the start. I think that's pretty amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...I'm not really sure what's on your mind, but I'm glad I could help you work through it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Me too. So let's head back, already. No distractions, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What is it, Rochelle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...I can hear something coming from deeper in the forest. Sounds like monsters...and beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>They're all really excited about something. Hearing it, it's like it's getting me worked up too. ...Kishaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Excited about something? Is something going on in the forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I dunno. I'm gonna go check it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I guess this is one of those distractions... I don't want to cause any trouble for the others back in town, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Fun times spent with friends... That's what Ishi wants to protect. I have to make sure nothing interferes with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...Ok! Let's go, Rochelle.</td>
