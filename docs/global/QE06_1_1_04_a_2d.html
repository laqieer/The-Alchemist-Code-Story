<td>Ouro—what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Now this is a peculiar fate. To think that one such as you would desire strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What is peculiar about wanting to become stronger?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I doubt that is your true desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What?! It is only natural to want to have the strength to save those in need!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I suppose you would be unaware. I should have figured someone like you would be this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Someone...like me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You will find out soon enough. So, why do you seek strength?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The eyes house your soul, and your soul resides in the humdrum of the everyday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Those are Celis's words. She embraced me as a mother would her child, and taught me these words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>To protect the normalcy of the every day is to protect one's soul itself. Those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I wish to protect the normal daily lives of all of Wadatsumi, not just my own. And yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>As I am now, I can't even protect one small life in front of me! I can't do anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So, yes, I desire power! I need the strength to stand against the cruelty I see before me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I cannot tell if this passion I see is yours, or if your true self is showing itself from behind the veil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It may even be the product of that overlapping that occurred when you were born, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This must be the fate wrought by that one and their sin upon the sleeping land...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I would say this is the perfect stage for you to shine. I will see this through to the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I will not make a contract with you, yet it is not insignificant that we crossed paths here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I can at least assist you in unleashing your latent powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I have no idea what it is you are talking about, but if it is going to help me save that little girl, then...do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I will accept nothing less!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Now then... Show me how your actions will affect that one's slumber!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You, molded by the land of sin... Show me how you will struggle against your own destiny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ngh... What was I...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Grrraahgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm...back?! But this is when I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No! I will not give up! I will save that little girl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I must have the strength to save the lives of those before me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>"Look."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>"This is what Wadatsumi is meant to be."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>"I still believe."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>"I still believe Wadatsumi will regain such peaceful days once more!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(Such a warm voice. Different from the ones I usually hear.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(I can feel it. A warm power surging within me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wh-what the hell is that?! Did I say that?! Did I summon that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Gragh! Gnnnngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>M-Mom?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Run! While I have it bound!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>N-no! I can't just leave Mom here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Trust me, I wish I could save her too! But that's just not possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No! I'm not leaving Mom! I'm not going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Do you think your mother would want to see you dead? Think of how she would feel if it was her own hands that killed you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wouldn't she wish for you to be alive and well, no matter what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Mom...! Mom!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hurry!</td>
