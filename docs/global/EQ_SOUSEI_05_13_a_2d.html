<td>Grooooooarrrgghhh!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>H-hey! Nyx?! Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ah, I'm fine, I'm fine... I just used a little too much magil...so I can't move...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm willing to bet that Mira collapsed in the castle just like me... There really is no end to her nonsense...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I may have pushed you both too hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>How are things here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We've somehow lured Leviathan all the way to the border, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaghhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well, you saw what happened there... It somehow turns its surroundings into more ocean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...That water manipulation technique again, I see. If we don't do something about that, we stand no chance of winning against it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You guys were looking for a way to deal with that, right? I'm assuming you're here 'cause you figured something out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Long time no see, little lady. Don't tell me—that's the Silver Shield?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hm, the shape looks the same, but it's giving me a different vibe now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's because the shield was reborn as a Gear of Judgement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We've granted it a new name to honor the legend of the first shield maiden in this area: "Mesarthim."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And there's this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh, you got something for me too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This pitch-black sword is called Hamal. When paired with Mesarthim, it forms a Gear of Judgement called Aries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh, so it's a set! Um... Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Mesarthim... The shield specializes in one specific thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Namely, repelling threats and establishing safety. Also known as the Silver Shield's divine protection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>However, that alone will not topple a Cursed Beast. Defense and offense are two sides of the same coin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's why we created the pitch-black sword "Hamal". We've imbued the blade with Anti-Curse magic, which should allow you to cut through Leviathan's carapace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Why are you giving it to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Because I assumed that we'd have to fight against the Leviathan at sea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's already hard enough to walk on water, and that's without a beast that can create tsunamis as an obstacle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That means you'll need a place to walk, a path that can be created and adjusted on the fly as the battle rages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Me and Yna will create such a thing by freezing the water through the power of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>However, if the two of us are occupied, that doesn't leave a lot of people to actually battle the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I see. So that's where me and the little lady come in. The perfect job for a pair of knights!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ack! Hey, think you can wrap up the strategy meeting?! I'm at my limit here, so put that plan into action already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Got it. Yna, are you ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes. This Sephirium Sword was forged so it could amplify your alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Let's see what it can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Here we go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>"I am Transcender of the Gate of Lust!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>"O Lord, though to supplicate is to be impertinent—"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...Yeah, this should work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Groooooarrrghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It's coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Tch! The ice isn't stable yet! Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Mesarthim, please lend me your strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Whoa! Never thought I'd see an ice path in the middle of the ocean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Too bad there's not time to appreciate the sight. Time to fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We'll back you up with Spiritbonding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Imnus will be leading a unit our way too, but we don't have the time to wait for him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Which means... Daphne! Andechs! This battle is yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ours...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oh, we know! Don't we, little lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What a question for a much stronger knight to ask someone like me with a smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>He treats me as an equal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(Now I think about it, it's always been like this. I've been supported by many, treated so well by many...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Honestly, I still can't shake my fear. I'm so jealous of this knight that never seems to lose his fighting spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(But even if that doesn't change, even if envy burns in my chest, I will keep facing forward.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>(Since I was asked to keep facing that way, so...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yes, we can do it! The two of us can do whatever we put our minds to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Oooh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Uhm... What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Nothing! That's the spirit! I'll leave the defense to you, you leave the offensive to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Let's hunt ourselves a Cursed Beastie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ah, but it looks like we gotta deal with some of its "leftovers" first! Don't let your guard down everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>We've got the stage, so let's put on a good show! Whaddaya say, little lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>This is just the opening act, but it'll make for a decent warm up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I will do my very best!</td>
</tr>
