<td>Phew...well I've certainly come a ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's so quiet out here in the countryside... I rather miss the clamor of the colosseum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>How many times have we seen it now, folks? The winner is once again, the one and only, the beautiful blitzkrieg, Laila!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It seems my strength and beauty have prevailed yet again. You aren't growing tired of me are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>LAILA! LAILA! LAILA!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>

<td>007</td>
<td>(I can't pretend I don't love hearing them cheer my name, but... the pressure is really on now.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(Sometimes I wish I could be free of it...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But there's got to be more to freedom than all this walking...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>After all, what good is all my strength and beauty without any sort of purpose? What am I even doing with myself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...Oh? What is that sweet fragrance? Flowers? It seems to be coming from that forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Could this be a flower bed? There are so many of them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>They have such delicate beauty, but...also a powerful radiance, almost like the sun. Truly magnificent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hey! Hands off the flowers, you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Tch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I said back off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hey, wait a sec! ...You aren't with him, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You must be mistaken. My name is Laila, and I'm just passing through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't worry. I wouldn't be so brutish as to disturb these flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Flowers as strong and as beautiful as these... To trample on them would be like trampling on the sun itself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wait a minute... This lady's cool as heck! You're not anything like that guy who was trying to sell them for cash!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That peeping Tom from before? Brutes like that are a zeni a dozen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's right! Just the other day this guy was trying to grab a bunch of them, so I kicked the crap outta him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You did? A big man like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah, no sweat! Oh, but you know what? We should probably get out of here. It's not safe hanging around these parts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Bugs drawn in by the flowers' scent always start to show up around this time. Look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, it appears you were telling the truth. But I can take care of myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This is perfect timing, in fact. You're about to get a front-row seat to a demonstration of my overwhelming strength and beauty!</td>
