<td>Huzzaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You can't beat me if you're carrying all that baggage around, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Nnngh...uugh! Aaaaaaaaaaagh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yomi?! What's happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power is separating itself from Yomi?! Is it manifesting as a kind of...Demon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's what Sumeragi was made for! Exercising the evil out of its host! Exercising...? Whatever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Can we...save Yomi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well...that was what I meant to do, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ghaaaaah! Aaaah! Uuugh! Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It won't fully leave her! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Either the hatred within Yomi is bonded too tightly with the Discarnate Power, or...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Or? Or what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yomi does not want to have the power separated from her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's nonsense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yomi suffered for so long trying to subdue and overcome her hatred!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Either way, this is the best Sumeragi can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Gotta go deeper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What do you mean...deeper?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well...that is...uhm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Aaaagh! Aaaaaaaagh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Leafah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Didn't I tell you I've got your back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If you have a plan, you better get on top of it, now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'll clear the way for you if necessary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't forget, I am the General of Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yomi! Can you hear me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Is this how you envisioned overcoming your past?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Of course it's not! Wasn't there supposed to be a better way?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Do you think that slaughtering everyone and everything in sight will settle all your problems?! I know that's not what you want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ugh... Urrrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I want to be your friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Rraaaaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Leafah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>We'll need to revise the dispelling effects of Sumeragi to act a little more...vehemently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>How can we do that? If there's anything I can do to save Yomi, to save Leafah, to save Wadatsumi... I'll do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Okay, so, uh... The demonic power is too much for any single person to wield. It's best in the hands of a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So someone of the Kagomurasaki Clan who is marked with strong affinity to their demonic heritage would be suitable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Y-you mean...me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Theoretically, if the blood of the Black Star Clan can awaken Sumeragi, then the blood of the Kagomurasaki Clan will surely be able to enhance it to contest the Discarnate Power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It should circulate the demonic power hidden within the sword through its wielder to boost their combat prowess and make them as strong as a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You could say it's a double-edged sword. Excessive power can ruin the wielder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>If the wielder is not an heir of the Kagomurasaki Clan or has not held the sword for long enough to grow accustomed to its power, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Their body may not be able to handle the flow of energy. They'll gain incredible power for a moment, but death will follow soon after.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hmph... You're surprisingly kind, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Leafah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yomi... I see myself in you. You bear a burden much too big for yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You overstretch yourself to do something beyond your capabilities. I understand you. So come back, and let's have a chat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>We've known each other for only a short time, but I want to see you again. Wake up, Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Nng... Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yomi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's it! Come back, Yomi! I'm here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Uuurgh! Aaaaaaagh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Raaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Are those...tears?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Aaargh! Aaaaaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Is Yomi...suffering?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You can hear me, right, Yomi?! You can still come back to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You are kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Wh-what are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You found a way out for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We both despised regulations and the idea of predestination. I was lost, but then you showed me that even I have the freedom to choose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I thank you, Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Jin... You're killing me here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I'm a man doomed to be killed by his little sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I can't let some monster kill me in her stead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Ren! Lend me a hand, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Leafah! Watch over me until it's done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I'm grateful to have met you both!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Gaaaaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Yomi... I will never leave you alone again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Where does this road to hell end?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>There is no way to escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I've cast away all that keeps me trapped!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I am the blade that cuts down demons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I'm the Demonic Killer, Jin!</td>
