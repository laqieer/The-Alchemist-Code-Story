<td>Hmm. The ruins are partially excavated, but it doesn't look like Teach was a part of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Certainly looks like far too much work for just one person.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Teach would run mental circles around any of her colleagues. She definitely wouldn't call any of them in to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I think it's as good a guess as any that she's still around here, at any rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>She might have gotten so excited that she stayed out longer than she intended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>With all these aggressive creatures around, though... the sooner we find her, the better.</td>

<td>007</td>
<td>Somewhere, on the other side of the ruins, in a small alcove underground...</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Various machines and broken displays litter the room, covered in layers of dust.</td>

<td>My, this is fascinating indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Such refined ancient technology. I wonder what secrets you will reveal to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It is unfortunate that many of these are destroyed beyond repair. Perhaps we may never discover what knowledge the ancients sought to preserve.</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Based on what I can deduce, however... it seems to be a laboratory dedicated to the study of Alchemy and its effects on living organisms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The desire of humans to harness such a forbidden power is well documented throughout history,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>but this is a rare finding of an actual research facility dedicated to such pursuits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>How wonderfully convenient that it should be in Lustburg. Right behind my house, no less.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So much to do! Ah, how I wish my lovely apprentices were still here with me.</td>
