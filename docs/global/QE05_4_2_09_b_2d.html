<td>I must say... You're a hard worker, aren't you, Marie? I could a learn a thing or two from you.</td>

<td>Oh, no, not at all! There's simply not much else for me to do here!</td>

<td>Wh-what?</td>

<tr>

<td>I know that I am a druidic priestess; that the blood running through my veins is considered special even among the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I am not sure what other possible reason there could be.</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>It's all right! There's nothing to worry about. Logi and the others will protect us, no matter—</td>

<td>Where...am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ah, it's been quite a while since we've had visitors here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Agatha</td>
<td>Wh-who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Agatha</td>
<td>Is that you, Marie? W-wait, you're not—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>There is nothing to fear. This is but the staircase that links the Truth to this world—or what is left of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Agatha</td>
<td>The...Truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Ah, so you have some level of self-awareness here, I see. This is very interesting—wait, no, that's not right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>I am very happy to think that your will has made it all the way here despite fate's folly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>I am certain that Ouroboros will rejoice in your return as well. You are the new Vessel of Reincarnation, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Agatha</td>
<td>The Vessel...of Reincarnation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Agatha</td>
<td>Wh-what does that even mean?! I don't know anything about that at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Agatha</td>
<td>I... I don't even know anything about myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>There is nothing to fear. The legend has already collapsed, and our protection has faded to a distant time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Only the name itself remains in this world. It is naught but a husk, which serves to tell us that such a role once existed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Agatha</td>
<td>If that's true, then why are Marie and I being targeted?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>That is because you are both vessels for the blood of the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Agatha</td>
<td>The Cursed...Beasts? I'm sorry, I really don't know anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Oh, you don't need to apologize! You are a very caring person, aren't you? To put it simply...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Ah, it seems that the connection is weakening. What am I going to do with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Oh, well. I suppose it cannot be helped. One last thing, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Beware the lure of the Stone. It seeks to enter this world via your desires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Agatha</td>
<td>Wait! What is that supposed to—</td>

</tr>
