<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Upsy-daisy! There we are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You're, um... Marie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh! Miss Agatha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oops! Oh, dear! There goes the laundry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ah! I'm so sorry! I'll pick it up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Th-thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I must say... You're a hard worker, aren't you, Marie? I could a learn a thing or two from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh, no, not at all! There's simply not much else for me to do here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Marie? I heard a scream. Is everything all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, Miss Mocca! I'm sorry! I'll bring it in now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No need to get all flustered. There's no rush. Agatha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Are you helping out around the barracks, too, Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yeah. I've got this illness, so no one will let me out on the front lines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's why I'm guarding Marie and helping out back here. They think it's easier on me, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>A-are you ill, Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh, right. I haven't told you about it, have I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The Jam that attacked the city in the desert left a curse on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Kamui and the others have helped me keep it suppressed, so it's actually not that bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Are you in pain? I... I'm sorry. That's a stupid question, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hahah! It does sting a bit sometimes, I suppose—more than a bit, really—but it's not like it's for forever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If we can take down Ceclidis, the curse should disappear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ceclidis... What does he want with Marie? What does he want with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I don't fully understand it, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I know that I am a druidic priestess; that the blood running through my veins is considered special even among the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I am not sure what other possible reason there could be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>A druidic priestess, huh? What is that, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm afraid I don't know. I am sorry. I know so little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's all right! There's nothing to worry about. Logi and the others will protect us, no matter—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh? Wh-what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Where...am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ah, it's been quite a while since we've had visitors here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wh-who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Is that you, Marie? W-wait, you're not—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>There is nothing to fear. This is but the staircase that links the Truth to this world—or what is left of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The...Truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ah, so you have some level of self-awareness here, I see. This is very interesting—wait, no, that's not right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I am very happy to think that your will has made it all the way here despite fate's folly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I am certain that Ouroboros will rejoice in your return as well. You are the new Vessel of Reincarnation, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The Vessel...of Reincarnation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wh-what does that even mean?! I don't know anything about that at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I... I don't even know anything about myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>There is nothing to fear. The legend has already collapsed, and our protection has faded to a distant time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Only the name itself remains in this world. It is naught but a husk, which serves to tell us that such a role once existed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>If that's true, then why are Marie and I being targeted?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That is because you are both vessels for the blood of the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The Cursed...Beasts? I'm sorry, I really don't know anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Oh, you don't need to apologize! You are a very caring person, aren't you? To put it simply...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ah, it seems that the connection is weakening. What am I going to do with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh, well. I suppose it cannot be helped. One last thing, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Beware the lure of the Stone. It seeks to enter this world via your desires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Wait! What is that supposed to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...tha! ...ss Agatha?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Are you all right, Miss Agatha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I... Huh? Wh-what? D-did something happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You fell down all of a sudden. If Marie hadn't been holding onto you, you would've fallen on your face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What?! R-really?! I'm sorry! Th-thank you, Marie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You really don't look well. I think we ought to call for the medic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>N-no, I'm fine. It was just a dizzy spell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(What was that all about? Am I just tired?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The lure of the Stone... What could that mean?</td>
</tr>
