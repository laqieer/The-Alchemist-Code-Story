<td>001</td>
<td>An illusion?! Like before?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Once the resurrection ceremony is complete, your duties as the druidic priestess will come to their natural end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I tried to move up your wedding with Isidore before this happened, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I suppose it was all for naught.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Are you sure about this, Malta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes, Father. I have already made my decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>My fate was sealed the day Protector Judah passed away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What is this? What are they talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I will give my whole self to Sephiron, to protect this land, this village, and...the one I love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So Kamui's really popular, huh? Miss Malta, you must get nervous about that, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Heh, I mean, aren't you showing me around because you're hoping to see him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>N-no, I was just, you know, checking in with my patient! Doing my due diligence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Aw, that's disappointing. You know, if you keep making excuses like this, you'll never be more than childhood friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Uh-oh. Are you upset?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hisham, you little...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Are these...Malta's memories?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Father? You needed to speak to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Malta...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I have given my blessing to Isidore's request for your hand in marriage. I believe he is the right person to entrust the future of this village to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What?! But—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It has been decided. We cannot let the sacred bloodline die out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Sephiron does not have much longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yet our duty remains. We must do everything in our power to prevent its inevitable end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Just as your mother did before you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I already know how you feel about Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>However, he is of the Protectors' bloodline. His sephirah is proof that he is destined to bear the burden of the forbidden knowledge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The purity of the blood that runs through your veins, the blood that carries the final, hidden sephirah, cannot mix with his.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We must not repeat the mistakes of our ancestors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This is all for Sephiron. Please understand, Malta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I... Yes, Father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It has always been you I wanted to be with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Malta...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I wanted to be with you. I wanted you to want me. I just couldn't be honest about how I felt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Father would not allow it, because he knew you would eventually become the Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Father loved you as he would his own son, but his devotion to Sephiron always came first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I assume Father told you to give up on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Malta, that's—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I know, I know. That's why I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Malta, no!</td>
</tr>
