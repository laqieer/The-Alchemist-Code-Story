<td>003</td>
<td>Zzzzz...</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>He simply had to get one last dig in. At least he won't remember a thing when he comes to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I don't suppose he will be giving any more—at least, not for the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No one will give him a second look behind this wall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That should do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If you hadn't stepped in, I would have been in quite the predicament.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Thank you, Madam...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, just Minerva will do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Think nothing of it. I've spent enough time around Roxanne to understand how unsavory some parts of Slothstein are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>She's your apprentice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I take it you have at least heard of her? Your distress seems to stem from somewhere other than mere...homelessness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...It's a long story...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Then I have a guest for the evening. Come along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's been quite the day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't want to exaggerate, but I really do owe you my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You can express your gratitude with a thorough explanation, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...And that is the truth of it. I've made no attempt to obscure anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>For what it's worth, I only hope everyone made it out safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'm sorry things turned out this way, and for my part in the invasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's rather much to take in, I must admit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If you'd rather leave me to my fate, I completely understand. You've done more than enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And be complicit in the demise of a good-hearted savior? Be at ease, Emrys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If you truly wish to help—and I think you do—we should try to find the reason why Goetia is so adamant on securing both Soren and your sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Who is Soren, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>A good question with no easy answers. Attend me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>He is a dear friend and darling boy, but much of his past is still quite...unknown, to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>An enigma wrapped in a mystery, that one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>His past comes to him in fragmented memories: echoes of an existence from an age ago, of a man who yearned to eradicate the pain of warfare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What about the experiments? How did he come to know the Elylon Teg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You'll have to ask him that yourself, I'm afraid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>All we know for now is his past involvement with the Constructs, one of which has presently been shut down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>As for why Goetia would want him...I can only surmise it has to do with his past research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It is nothing good, at any rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Is there anything we can do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Minerva pulls out a small, azure jewel which glows faintly in the dim light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If they are still within the city, our best course of action would be to observe them from afar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>This jewel detects changes in Alchemia concentration; I'm sure with some sleuthing, we'd be able to pinpoint their general vicinity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Soren is quite suffused with the stuff, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I see. I don't know if Goetia's sample of his Alchemia signature is enough to track him or my sister down, but it is better that we are aware as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>In any case, Goetia's influence is startlingly enormous in this part of the city. The public is not privy to the details of the incident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Not privy, you say...but aware? Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>A glimmer of understanding flashes over Minerva's eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I came here for a social visit, but it seems it has now become a..."research trip."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>As my lovely assistant, you and I will look into the "prodigious Alchemia concentration" surrounding the area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The public's curiosity thus aroused, it is only a matter of time before the authorities are summoned...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...Limiting Goetia's influence and constricting their range of operations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hopefully this will buy the rest enough time to escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Of course, we cannot keep our appearances up forever. Before long, you and I will have to "conclude" our research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The safest place is often in plain sight. I would assume my apprentices would make for my abode in Lustberg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Fates willing, we would be able to strategize from there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It's a risky plan built upon assumptions, but I can think of no better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(Eira...please be safe.)</td>
