<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>So it's true about the Cursed Beasts... The documents from Lustburg are consistent. My observation is complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I knew it... It's just like I thought. This...is a record of a war fought in the distant past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Perhaps it should be called "The Great Battle of the Cursed Beasts". Once I'm done researching the seven giant beasts, I will need to do a lot more research about the related factors, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If this is true, it's a discovery that ought to be written into the history of Alchemy. Mm... I'm going to investigate this some more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Kaya...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This part is interesting. Don't disturb me, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tell me this. What would happen if the Cursed Beasts were to be resurrected?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The possibility of their resurrection isn't something I've set out to observe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Maybe not, but it's been on my mind. I wouldn't have accompanied you merely because I was afraid of losing you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>My intention as Lord Commander was to understand the meaning behind that mural.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I don't have enough information yet, and I don't really want to discuss hypotheticals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's possible that the world could be destroyed, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That is a possible outcome. Preventing that is one of the reasons for my investigation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>In that case, although our paths may differ, our cause is the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Kaya, I now understand your duty, and how important it is that you accomplish what you are trying to do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>And it's something that only you can do. I want you to take your time, observe, and investigate until you find the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>In the meantime... I'll work on fulfilling my duty. Likewise, it's something that only I can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It seems you finally understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Kaya, bout with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I must surpass you, Kaya, and give you a proper send-off toward your new path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This is the resolution I have come to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Heh heh. You're tactless, you know that? And you're as clueless about women as ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You really are a chivalrous fool...and a blockhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I do like that look in your eyes. Allow me to test your resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I suppose this is a good spot for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Nn...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This is unusual for me...but I won't hold back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Come to think of it...this is our first bout, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If you let your guard down, you won't get off lightly. You do realize that my Alchemia is of an irregular class, do you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I possess Alchemia on par with the Sephira... "Alchemia Pura".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That is exactly why you're worth defeating. I will surpass you, here and now, as both your Lord Commander and as an old friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Kaya...as you set out on your new path, this is my parting gift to you! For I am a bastion of absolute justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>There's that fire of yours. If you truly are capable of shouldering the justice of Babel, then come... Show me!</td>
