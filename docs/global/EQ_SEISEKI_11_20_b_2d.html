<td>Captain Kudan...</td>

<td>Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huzzzaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Has he lost it?! He's even attacking you now! Does he intend to just cut down everything he sees?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Kudan... No, Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Has he really fallen so far?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>No. Captain Kudan is a good man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>For the future of all humankind, he is sacrificing himself and stepping into darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What you see before you is the result of his paying the price. Kagura, I want you to burn this image of him into your memory.</td>

<tr>

<td>Huzzaahhhh!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Captain Kudan.... I swear that I will stop you, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You chose a different path than I did, and now you've followed it to its conclusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>All you have ever done has been with the future of Babel in mind, pure and simple. So, really...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Argh...! Nnrghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If things had been different, I might have ended up where you are now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Grraaaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That's why I'm going to stop you! I have to stop you at any cost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I have to, because there's no one else... I'm the only one who can save you now! Huzzzaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>

<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Please, let this reach you! Shining Holy Judgment!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ngh?! Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I-is it over?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa... N-not yet... He's just lost consciousness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Still... Kudan has completely lost himself to the darkness, hasn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yes...though I'm sorry to say it. Basheeny, what's the situation like over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Reinforcements have arrived and the battle is turning in our favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>News of Orion's defeat is circulating, spreading unrest among the Greed Dike soldiers, so it's just a matter of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I see... Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What's going to happen to Captain Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>He's already given himself over to the darkness. When he wakes, he will probably start attacking everything he sees again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I don't think Kudan ever wanted...this. Kanon, please... Put him to rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>No. I have absolutely no intention of killing Captain Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>If I did that... I couldn't save his soul. I'm sure it would just wander the darkness forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Then what do you intend to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Kagura, do you remember what Chihaya told you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Chihaya...? You mean, the Chihaya we tried to save on that rescue mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yes. She told us that we must value our friends, right? That they're the ones who'll save us when we're in danger of being consumed by darkness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>So I won't rest until I save Captain Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Save...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Yes. I will soothe his troubled soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You don't mean...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yes. I will take him to the Door of Truth. Just as Captain Cadanova sealed Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Wha—?! But if you do that...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Even if I take him there, there's only a very slim chance that my plan will work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Regardless, I want to save Kudan... Kudan, who saved the world. This will be my final task as Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Besides...I don't have much time left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What?! What do you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You can't mean...the Burning Seal?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>The power that Captain Monzein used?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>No way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>It's all right. I have all of you. Friends who can fight on equal footing with the Greed Dike soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Thanks to you, I can go and save Kudan without any regrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>P-please, hold on! Isn't there a possibility that you can come back alive?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>There is, but...there is only a very slim chance of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Basheeny... You have to be the one who supports the Holy Guard from here on out. Be strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Kagura, Chloe... I need a favor. Basheeny is still young. I want you to help him rebuild the Holy Guard with him at the center.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What?! W-wait a minute! What do you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Take this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>What? Excalibur...? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Basheeny... I, the 11th Lord Commander, appoint you as the 12th Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>There are no Captains left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Except for Kagura, whose duty is to devote her life to sealing the Mikaboshi away if it appears again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I can't make her Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>But why me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Well, I just kind of felt like you were the right person for the job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>You're young, but you also know all too well how terrifying the power of darkness is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Terrifying...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Yes. So long as the true nature of Corpse remains unclear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I believe that it is necessary for the person who leads the Holy Guard to have a strong awareness of the power of darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Corpse...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>They are a dangerous entity. If we leave them be, they will eventually cause corruption in the Holy Guard again, and possibly even bring about its destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I think it would be best for us to expose the true nature of their existence as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>All right. I'll do my best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Is this really the only way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Yes... I'm sorry to put all of this on your shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>What are you talking about? No one can accuse the hero who saved the world of being selfish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Besides, you're doing all this to save Kudan. I'm the last person who can complain about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Heheh... Kagura, you must live, so that you can pass on the history of what happened here to the next generation. You're the only one who can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I know. I will not let the significance of this battle fade, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Yup. That's why you have to get married.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>If you're passing something on to the next generation, it's easiest to start with your own children, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Well, you might have a hard time with that if you don't work on your feminine appeal a little more, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Wha—?! What are you saying?! I don't want to hear that from you, airhead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>C-come on... This isn't the time for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Chloe, you need to try your best, too, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>If you don't keep an eye on Captain Vettel, he'll be snatched up by someone else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Wh-what are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Nnrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>H-hey! He's waking up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>The darkness works faster than I thought. I guess...this is goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I want the two of you to live happily ever after, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Kanon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Good luck, everyone! I wish you all the best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>A-all...right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Lord Commander Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Dangit! Is there nothing else we can do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Don't make that face. With this, I can save the world...and Captain Kudan. I'm counting on you guys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>No matter what...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Someday, I will save you, Kanon! You have to live on, you airhead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I know you will. I'm counting on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Nnrgh... Arrggghhhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Crap! He's awake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Don't worry, Captain Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Urgh... Nrghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>We have so many determined friends. I'm sure they will protect the peace of this world for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Nrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Urgh... Nrrrghh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Captain Kudan is...crying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Oh... Captain Kudan must know that we'll never let him down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>All right, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Lord Commander Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Goodbye, everyone. Goodbye, beloved world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>No, Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Ngh! Wh-what was that light?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>No... This can't be happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Kanon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Lord Commander Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>The light of the Tower of Babel is...gone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Reporting! Reinforcements have arrived at the border of Lustburg and Gluttony Foss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Th-they will be here...any moment now! Thank...the gods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Suzuka! Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>It's...the end of the battle. I can't afford to rest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Argh! Retreat! Retreat!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Don't let them escape! Charge!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>They're retreating. Does this mean we won?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Seems like it. Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>It's fine. I'm just a little tired. Let's go eat something sweet when we get back, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Gerald... It's over. It's finally over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>The light of the Tower of Babel has vanished?! What's going on over there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>I don't know... It's a world beyond our wildest imagination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>I suspect that everything was swallowed up by the world on the other side of the Door of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Lord Commander Kanon... She's really...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>That can't be true, can it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>That airhead... She became a fine Lord Commander right under our noses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>No! Kanon! N-no... Nngh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>So the Lion Monarch's Charge, which shook the people of Babel to their core and ensnared an entire continent, came to an end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Having lost their true king, the Greed Dike soldiers submitted to Northern Pride and the other countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>They swore to restore their home nation and then disappeared from history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>The Lion Monarch's Charge, which came at a very dear price, came to represent the absolute justice of the Holy Guard across Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Faith in the Holy Guard was heightened, and for a while, the world enjoyed a time of peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>This is the story of the knights who defined a certain era.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>History recounts the stories of those fiery souls who overcame the greatest threat that the world has ever known, and became legends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Hey! Go and tell them to send people over here, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>What?! No! The palace is in need of more workers! Send some this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Nngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Urgh! N-not yet... I am not finished! I-I can...still—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Sadly, you are mistaken. The curtain has already fallen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>I am somewhat surprised you were not able to succeed in resurrecting Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>W-Waginau! What...are you doing? J-just standing there?! C-come here and...heal me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>No, it is too late for you. You are no longer able to house Nimul's soul within you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>No matter. Another Vessel of Reincarnation will be born soon enough. It's only a matter of a few decades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Decades are nothing compared to the millennia I've waited. It will be nothing more than the blink of an eye to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>M-millennia?! Wh-what are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Your end is near. Let this be a parting gift.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>My name is Waginau Cradle. I lived among Nimul and Emmel at the time of Alchemy's creation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>C-Cradle?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>I-I've heard...of... Y-you can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>The founder and first Lord Commander of the Holy Guard?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>You are well educated. Indeed, I am he.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>I-it can't be! How can this be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>In all of history, none have come as close to resurrecting Nimul as you have. Sadly, you chose to kill Emmel's Vessel of Reincarnation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Unfortunately, that was the nail in the coffin for you. Had you not done that, Nimul would not have rejected you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>N-Nimul...rejected me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>The two of them wish to be reunited. As do I. At least you have served well as a fine example of one possible outcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>I will remember your deeds; particularly which ones to avoid. Well done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Urgh...! Grk... Huzzaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>I am the Lion Monarch! If I am to go down, I will take you with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Gh! Nngh! S-so...this is how...it ends. Waginau...you're coming with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>I'm sorry to say that you'll be dying alone today. I must bear witness to the reunion of Nimul and Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>Nng...Urgh... Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>Farewell, Lion Monarch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>H-how...disappointing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>Hmph. This presence... So those with true grit still exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>Nimul, Emmel, sleep for now. We shall meet again soon enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>I will prepare the appropriate vessels for you before then. Heh. Haha... Hahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>Captain Kagura! We've confirmed that all Greed Dike forces have withdrawn from Northern Pride!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>Are our forces pursuing them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>As you've commanded, the soldiers are avoiding excessive pursuit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>Thank you. We should focus for now on restoring our chain of command. Everything else can wait until the Emperor's condition recovers. Got it, Basheeny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>Don't "Huh?" me, Basheeny. You're the Lord Commander now. You're supposed to be the one calling the shots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>Oh! Right. Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>The damage here is far more devastating than what our country suffered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>Yeah... Who knows how long it will take and what it will cost them to rebuild.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>I don't think there's really anything to worry about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>241</td>
<td>It looks like Kanon's willpower was inherited by everyone here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>242</td>
<td>Of course we have! If we don't take it on, then who will?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>243</td>
<td>Glad to hear you're so pumped up about this, but have you considered doing something a little more effective than talking? Like...actually working?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>244</td>
<td>Hey! You're still just a squire! You can't tell me what to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>245</td>
<td>Uh, so... Could I maybe borrow you two for a second?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>246</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>247</td>
<td>Um... As the new Lord Commander, there's something I feel like I must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>248</td>
<td>Well? You're Lord Commander now, so you don't need our permission to do anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>249</td>
<td>Oh! Right! Okay, then... Bud! Victor! Draw your swords!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>250</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>251</td>
<td>You trying to start a fight? Here? Now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>252</td>
<td>No, no, no. Lord Commander Kanon entrusted the future to us, the younger generation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>253</td>
<td>I was thinking we ought to make a vow to solidify our will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>254</td>
<td>A vow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>255</td>
<td>We should set our captains' minds at ease by showing them how earnest we are about building a peaceful future. Besides, the timing seems right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>256</td>
<td>A bit of a romantic, aren't you? All right, let's do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>257</td>
<td>Ugh... Do you have to be so excited about everything all the time?</td>
</tr>
