<td>Ack! What a terrible bombardment! It's hard to believe it's a hallucination!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>My technique differs from Vier's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Her ability is to use scent to stir up hallucinations. In contrast...my ability directly appeals to all five senses...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh...?! Fire?! ...Ugh! I-it's hot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>My technique affects the senses; not just sight and sound, but touch, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Pain blurs the boundary between reality and fantasy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Even if you understand it in your head, your five senses cause the hallucination to be undiscernible from reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ugh! N-no! This pain is not real! I won't let it mislead me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Are you sure? Those flames may be real, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wha...?! Ac...ack!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well then...allow yourself to burn to death...along with a town that is filled with false justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>False...justice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Every time you advocate the term absolute justice, it causes my skin to crawl. That false justice of yours is over now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>U-ugh...! I-it's true that...we have our faults...but we...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No matter how much you try to justify it, it's pointless after what happened to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What happened to you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I was once abandoned by you...and left to perish tragically in my home town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're...from Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You tolerate aggression...and refuse to take responsibility for anything. That's the truth behind the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but I cannot accept your form of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ughh...! I-it's true...I cannot excuse myself regarding any of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But...why? Why are you now with Greed Dike...who destroyed your hometown?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Of course...I have no intention whatsoever of forgiving them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>However...in order to achieve my objective, I cannot afford to be selective of what jobs I take on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I-is that what your leader Sol said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Our leader said that once this is dealt with...our wish will come one step closer...to becoming reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I trust and follow these words and act on them...that is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wi...wish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We wish to bring light to our home; Lost Blue...a sky to call our own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>A sky...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It will save the Lost Blue people of the world who are oppressed, and will mean winning the same rights as those who live above the surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We'll be different from you people who pretend those who suffer...don't exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>There...we have the true justice...where those who truly suffer can live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>In my life as a priestess, I moved from place to place, witnessing all too many acts of tragedy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Eventually, I arrived at Lost Blue, where the will of the leader caused me to make up my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>All this so-called justice in this world is nothing more than a facade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>False justice is useless. What we aim for is true justice for those who are truly suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...Ugh...is that who you...the Templars are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes. Today, as of now, the words "absolute justice" will represent who we are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So...let those words burn within you and give you a peace of mind.</td>
