<td>Huff...huff... She's really...strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>There are three of us, but we can't seem to catch her at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's like she's watching us from above...and completely grasps our position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Seeing things from a bird's eye view is one of the first things you learn when serving as an air defense mage. Lisbeth...how high up can you see from there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's true that this country is sick. There's no doubt that the Sacred Stone is the cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If you know that's the case...then please get out of the way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That being said, even if you were to remove the curse of the Sacred Stone, do you think it would make everyone happy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>At night, when I look down at the city...I can see a trickle of small lights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Each of these small lights is a separate life...some happy and some unhappy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There are those in this country who happily coexist with the curse and those who have been crushed by the curse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Lisbeth...all that you are trying to do is to flip the happy and the unhappy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Even if you were to flip this entire country around...it wouldn't make everyone happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You'll be able to pull it off, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Coming up to this point, you've healed a lot of people, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Whether it be the court mages, the Bugmail, or the vermin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>They were all opponents who you were risking your life to fight against.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>When it comes to you, Liz, even if this country's common sense and everyone's position and lifestyle were to be flipped around...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You would still reach out to each person and lend them a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You even saved me, after having once said terrible things to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Liz, you're not flexible enough to see things from a bird's eye view.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Neither are you clever enough to persuade people with rhetoric.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But you try to save everyone who comes into your line of sight. You try to stop any battle that occurs in your path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There is no witch more straightforward than you in all of Lustburg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Alma...Rebecca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I see. So that's why there were so few casualties during this conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Liz is really bad at giving up. She wants to remove the curse of the Sacred Stone, but she doesn't want to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If she has no choice but to fight, she always wants to heal as much as she damages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That kind of stubbornness has moved adults such as the headmistress and Salomo. Do you know why, Captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Seeing the witches of the castle, I realized that part of becoming an adult is about giving up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But, in life, if you give up on something, at that point, it's nothing more than an elaborate process of self-destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>In Liz's case, she continues to tell those adults who have given up...those people who are slowly dying, to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>She shares her life force with them. She brings these adults back to life who have long remained subdued.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...I see. It looks like I chose the wrong opponent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>As an adult, I may not be able to stop you. Lisbeth, I understand your resolve now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Then...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That being said, resolve alone can neither save people nor a country. Strength is a necessity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So, show me. Use the power that you've obtained to help others...to defeat my selfishly-obtained power!!!</td>
