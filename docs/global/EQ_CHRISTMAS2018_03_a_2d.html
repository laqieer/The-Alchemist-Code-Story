<td>We've been walking for forever. Are we there yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Just a bit further!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm pretty sure you said that an hour ago. Well, whatever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It must be nice to be so young. I am already quite tired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Shouldn't be too long now. Keep going, Birgitta!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Not too long, hmm? By the way, Klima, did you feel the flow of Alchemia, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes, I think so. I can sort of...feel it on my skin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I can't really explain it, but I just know that someone is interfering with the weather.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I see. So we felt the same thing, then. It appears that you and I share the same sense of intuition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I can't believe anyone would want to get in the way of the Winter Holiday that everyone looks forward to so much. It's...unforgivable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Now, now. Calm down, Klima. There's no point in getting all wound up—you'll just tire yourself out more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I-I know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You really are fond of the Winter Holiday, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>When I was little, we used to celebrate it every year in my village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Everyone was so warm and kind... It was so much fun, even though Santa never came to visit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It does sound like it has given you some wonderful memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yeah... Even though there was no Santa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Klima, do you want to meet Santa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I do. I heard that you can meet him if you're really good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So I'm going to be good, and do my best to make it snow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We're here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This is the village of the guardians of the Winter Holiday, the home of the Maruda Tribe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So this is the Maruda Tribe's village, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No way! There's no snow at all?! I thought this was supposed to be the land of snowmen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's not the land of snowmen. It's the village of the Maruda Tribe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Like we told you already, it hasn't snowed at all. We have no idea why, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's because you desecrated the Winter Holiday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huh?! You're...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>W-wait! What are you talking about?! D-desecrated...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You humans spread our beloved Winter Holiday across the world and got it all twisted! You ruined it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We have to right the wrong of the Winter Holiday! Yuki, Kyu... You were the ones who said that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>O-of course! That's why we left, so that we could teach the humans about the true meaning of the Winter Holiday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yet here you two are, with your heads held high like heroes, when all you did was let yourselves get won over by the humans and didn't even change anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Th-that's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Now look at them! The humans are trying to start another poor excuse for a Winter Holiday all over again! You've been too soft on them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Anything other than a real Winter Holiday is inexcusable! Humans just do it all wrong! I won't let them mess it up again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You don't deserve to have snow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Goodness! It appears that we are only making things worse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This unnatural Alchemia flow... So you're the one preventing the snow from falling, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So what if I am?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I will not allow it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>How could you interfere with the holiday that everyone is looking forward to—and for such a selfish reason? It's...inexcusable.</td>
</tr>
