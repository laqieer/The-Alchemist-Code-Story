<td>Phew. I guess that about does it. I'll need to ask Veloz to do some maintenance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>When it comes to old clock towers, maintenance is never easy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You seem hard at work. Timekeeper...Ethan, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Lord Alvarez?! What are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I heard rumors that our country's Sacred Stone is enshrined in this clock tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What?! Wh-who told you that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Heheh. It's easy to tell when someone isn't used to lying. Your uneasiness is palpable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We don't have time...so let me be frank. I want you to place the Sacred Stone Belphegor in my care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?! What nonsense...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm sure you've heard the rumors that Alchemy was behind the destruction of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That same threat is sweeping towards Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>As the protector of the Sacred Stone, I think you understand the weight of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Right now our country is facing the greatest threat it ever has since its founding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Mayor Edward is bound to the old customs and has kept his silence, but...this situation isn't one that can be dealt with using old strategies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We no longer live in the old and peaceful days. If the outside world were to know of the Sacred Stone's existence, it could lead to unnecessary casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Do you want our country to be destroyed like Envylia or Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Of course, I don't! I too feel the same threat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In fact, I've also made repeated proposals to my master regarding that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>And he is telling you that there's no need to change the location of the Sacred Stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Looks like I guessed right. That's why I came to ask you, Timekeeper, someone who truly cares about our future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm not asking you to give me the Sacred Stone. Once I'm finished, I'll return it immediately to the clock tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>With the power of the Sacred Stone, we can create technology that can counter the hidden threats we face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You understand, right? Whether this country survives or not rests on your decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...!</td>
