<td>Greed Dike's development is—and always has been—largely based on that particular principle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Yet all throughout that development, they were under the watchful eyes of the suzerain nation of Northern Pride, the magitocracy of Lustburg...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>And an isolated little island operating under its own unique traditions, known as Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>But Greed Dike had nothing special to offer—nothing they could use to gain any particular advantage over the surrounding nations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>They didn't have enough wealth to develop themselves any further, and they had no materials with which to entice trade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>And so, as a nation, they came to a firm decision:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Whatever they were lacking, they could simply steal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>But stealing isn't easy. What do you need, to be a successful thief? You need power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Armed forces, a military... Anything would do, really, as long as it provided them the power they needed to take what they wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>The strong always come out on top. Strength dictates what is and is not considered righteous. History has proven this many times over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Or rather, the history of others has proven this. Greed Dike's history, on the other hand, is stained with failure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Because they've never quite had enough power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>And that... That's the reason.</td>

<td>That's why I set my sights on the demons of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>

<td>Judius</td>
<td>Their power far surpasses that of humans. If we can control, replicate, and mass-produce them... Well, then I'd say that qualifies as a weapon, wouldn't you?</td>

<td>Our emperor dabbled with the Alchemy Source, but I decided to follow my own personal ideals, and researched a method of weaponizing demons for use in our human wars.</td>

<td>Even when the Lion Monarch's Charge was crushed and the nation's power was weakened, I kept experimenting, tirelessly...day in and day out. And finally, it all pays off!</td>

<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>We'll use this weapon to invade other countries and build ourselves into the superpower we were always destined to be. So once more, please do allow me to thank you.</td>

<td>Judius</td>
<td>Not knowingly, no. But you were all such perfect test subjects. The experiment would've never seen such pristine results without you.</td>
