<td>Umgf... Mmff... Umff... Umgf... Inari sushi is the best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm curious, second-generation Night Fox. What motivates you to plunder?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why? What a ridiculous question... How else am I suppose to carry on the name of the Night Fox as my teacher taught me to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Mmff... Yeah... Who does that guy think he is anyway, asking me something like that. Umgf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Umgf... But... Why couldn't I just say all that when he asked?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Whew! That was delicious. Time to get back to work! Things don't just steal themselves! Come on, Tsuru!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Today's target is right over there! It's owned by a man notorious in this town for his shady business practices. Tsk, tsk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Fancy meeting you here, second-gen. You've got business here as well, have you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Chat Noir...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I am delighted that you remember me, my sweet little second-gen baby thief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Have you found an answer to my question yet? I seem to recall that you didn't respond...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I steal for those who are less fortunate, as my teacher instructed me. He was a chivalrous thief, and my duty is to continue his mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A duty and a mission, huh? My, but those are big shoes to fill. You must have respected him greatly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Do you not wish to surpass your teacher's legacy as the Night Fox?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Surpass his...legacy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>From your face, I can see that you have never even considered it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No. I only...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Only... What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I only ever wanted to be just like him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see. The first Night Fox was very important to you, wasn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>In fact, it seems to me that you're still chasing after him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You...might be right. When he was alive, that was all I ever did. I just wanted to get closer to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Closer, huh? If you ask me, I’d say that your teacher passed on the title to you so that you'd keep chasing him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What kind of chivalrous thief was he, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>He was the kindest, strongest person I have ever known. He saved so many people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm...not sure I can be all that he once was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>My teacher...always made protecting happiness his priority by being gentle and kind. I loved him for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Happiness, huh? It seems that my instincts weren't wrong, after all. Your teacher sounds like he was a good sort. I think that if that's your goal, then you're not doing too badly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Is it really that simple?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Maybe... Maybe it can be. Maybe I can achieve the same things as he did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The happiness of the people is the true treasure of the Night Fox. I steal to protect. That is my answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Not bad. Seems like I've finally gotten what I wanted and met the true Night Fox.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>By the way, I plan to steal all the money and goods on this property. This will be my last job here in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I thought you only stole art?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Heheh. Consider this...a challenge, of sorts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Let the games begin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It’s all-or-nothing. Just a fun competition between fellow thieves to add a little extra spark to the night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If you think I'll just let you steal the reparations due to my people, you have another thing coming. I have my pride and my teacher's pride as the Night Fox on the line!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>If I lose, I will abandon the name of the Night Fox forever! Come on, Tsuru! We have something to prove.</td>
</tr>
