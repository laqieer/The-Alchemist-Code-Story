<td>Hey, did you hear? The village to the west of here got swallowed by the flames of corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Already? That's the third one this month.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It seems the invasion of the Invidia Belt also failed miserably. At this rate we're all going to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Did you hear King Arius lost?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>He is basically wrath itself! None of us have ever come close to matching him and they beat him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Does the Invidia Belt possess such fearsome knights? Who could've possibly beaten him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And not just that—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh. Sulva. Are you...playing...outside the castle again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I don't care much for your antics. A brat ought to obediently listen to their caretakers. It would make all our lives much easier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I understand the urge to act out while you're in your rebellious phase, but that does not give you free rein to behave like a spoiled child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...What does a serpent want with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Nothing at all. I simply saw you passing by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I don't have any interest in you. Your pride will hit a dead-end sooner or later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>However, I have some thoughts about that sword you carry on your back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>My, my, no need to be so wary. Didn't I just tell you I have no interest in you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm busy enough keeping the Cursed Beast fed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Didn't you hear? Satna flattened another village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Here I am, trying so desperately to bring peace to this area, and there it goes, just doing whatever it wants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Aah... If only Icona were still alive. That women really just did whatever she felt like. Even in death she's selfish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'd laugh if it weren't for the fact that I now have to clean up her mess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...I'm here to meet the queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh? Go right ahead then. The end is near, child. Enjoy the time you have left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>After all, in this world it isn't unusual to die before you realize what is happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>My queen, are you awake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...My queen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...Sulva. What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What am I supposed to do? For what reason do I live?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Why would you ask me such things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Your life, your work, and your actions are your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Make your own decisions, face your own challenges, and live as you see fit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Are you still worried about what happened that day?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>When the former king—my brother Arius—sacrificed himself to save you? It was of his own volition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It may be the reason why he fell into corruption, but even if that is what makes our land perish, you aren't the one to blame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You carry the Red Blade. The very blade that my brother, the king, entrusted to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Nobody will voice their objections to your choices, regardless of how you use it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Perhaps, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>If you wished for the throne, then the sword would respond to that desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I am but a false monarch. The one recognized by the sword could make this castle built on falsity crumble at any time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I do not wish to be king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Then what is it that you desire? For what do you wield that sword? For what do you fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(I don't know what I desire.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(All I want is to repay the one who saved my life.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Grrroooooaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Haaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You dare when in the Ira Belt it is I that—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Nrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It's over, Arius.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hahahahahaha! Right. This is my end, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Your faith and ideals were once the light that showed us the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That's exactly why I do not wish to see you corrupted by wrath any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>And what will you do about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I will slay you. You will die at my hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ngh—! Ah—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You—! Why do you protect a Fallen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>This man—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>This man saved me... He shielded me from the corruption, so in turn I will—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I see... So that's why our king has become like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>He protected me, so in turn I must protect him, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...I'm afraid he's already fallen victim to the corruption. He will never return to his former self.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>This man is no longer the king you once knew. He's long since lost all his humanity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>And what about it?! Does that mean I should just give up on saving him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>He saved my life... And because of that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I will save his!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I've come here to save this country. In order to do that, I am prepared to dirty my hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>If that means fighting a child, then so be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Andechs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Don't interfere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>This is a fight between countrymen... Please, let me handle it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>...Haa... Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...Not bad, kid. You'd make a good knight one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>But this is the end. Run away. Don't throw your life away here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I can...still fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Oh my, it looks like someone left themselves wide open.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Andechs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Why did you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Hah...ha... Why indeed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Ande—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Such a tragic tale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>A fight between a boy who adores his fallen king, and the most prestigious knight of this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I would've loved to see the conclusion to this tale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Sadly, I'm afraid I do not have the time. I'm sorry, but we'll need to wrap this up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...Serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>What's this? I haven't even had the chance to introduce myself, and yet you determined my true identity in the blink of an eye. A very perceptive boy you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>But don't you know that introductions are an integral part of good etiquette?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I am Quence. And as you have already discerned, I am a member of the group you've been so desperately searching for: the Infinite Serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Ah well, it's a pity I don't have the time to entertain you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>This is but the worthless prologue before your end! Enjoy your eternal slumber!</td>
