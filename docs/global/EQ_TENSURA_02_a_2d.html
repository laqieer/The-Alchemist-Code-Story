<td>Hey, Albea. What's this Alchemia thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That girl from before, Ouroboros, I think? She mentioned that the orcs absorbed too much of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Alchemia is the source of power that lies within each and every living creature in Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Magic is performed by manipulating the Alchemia found in nature. Weapons like this which can manipulate Alchemia are called magitek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Those are some of the ways you can use Alchemia in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oooh, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And finally, there's Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You can summon beings called Phantom Soldiers who once lived in other eras through the use of Alchemy. Beings like us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>H-huh?! You two are dead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Pretty much. But Alchemy is considered a forbidden art, so we cannot tell you any more than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...My apologies. You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(Seems like it'd be better not to dig too hard into that last topic...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I gotcha! It sounds like your Alchemia is pretty similar to what we called magicules back in my world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Which means....</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ooh! I'm back to brimming with power! I think I can shapeshift like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>He...really turned into a human...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Incredible. Even though he was such a little round mochi looking thing a second ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yup, it's just as I thought. This world doesn't have magicules, so I just gotta fuel myself with whatever equivalent this world has.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Just as you thought? How did you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It was really just a hypothesis. I'm just lucky it worked out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>They are beings possessed by a ferocious appetite. They are currently ravaging and devouring their way through the forests of Saga, and accumulating tremendous amounts of Alchemia in their bellies by doing so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>They will inflict serious damage to Saga if nothing is done to stop them. Not to mention, our worlds will grow more and more tangled in a way that could spell disaster for both of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(...Ouroboros might've been referring to the orcs.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(If it's really them, they will continue to eat to satisfy their never-ending hunger. In which case, they'll also continue to absorb Alchemia.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hm? Oh, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It looks like I recovered the use of some of my skills by absorbing some Alchemia just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm not in peak condition or anything yet, but it should be enough to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh, which skills?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>A couple of my specialties!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Could you give us some examples?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hm, there's Sticky Thread, Paralysis Breath, Poison Breath, and so on...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Really? Those sound kind of...gross.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hm, well... That's cause I absorbed them from snakes and centipedes, haha... Oh, I also got Magic Sense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It lets me take note of the things in my surroundings, so I can use it to figure out where monsters are hiding. It's super useful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(Looks like I recovered another skill just now.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(Hey, Great Sage! It looks like I can use my high-level skills now too, right?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Answer: You are indeed capable of using Alchemia instead of magicules to perform those skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>However, it will take a significant amount of Alchemia to perform any of your high-level skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(I see. In that case...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh? You turned back into a slime already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yeah. Turns out maintaining a human form consumes a bunch of Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I figured it is better not to waste too much Alchemia just in case. I'll turn human again if we run into anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I don't really get it, but if that's what you want, that's fine by me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>So, what's the plan? Are we going to vanquish that calamity of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>No... I fear I haven't recovered my strength yet. For now, we should find my friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ouroboros said she brought some people here with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>And lucky for me, I've already found one using my Magic Sense. He shouldn't be too far away, so let's head there first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...I've got to admit, it's little embarrassing to meet him so soon after they all gave me that grand send-off, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I see. So you went on a journey to fulfill a promise to a dead friend of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But aren't you the country's ruler? Is it really okay for you to go wandering off somewhere by yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Eh, it's a pretty peaceful place these days. They'll be able to handle things without me for a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Perhaps, but aren't you worried about the comrades you left behind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hm. Well, of course I'm going to worry a little bit, but I know that those guys are capable enough. They'll be fine. Totally fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I see. You really trust them, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Albea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Trust... Sure. That sounds nice in theory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But do you have any idea how it feels to be left behind by the person you cherish most? I didn't think so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Matters of the heart aren't so easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>H-hey! What did you mean by thaâ€”?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Oomph! Why did you stop all of the sudden?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...There's something wrong with those beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Agreed. It looks like something scared them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>They're coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Gwwwaaaaarrrrrggghhhhh!</td>
