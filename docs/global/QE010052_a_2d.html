<td>Even if we don't discover the Demon itself if we find the Lizard Brigade we can have them give up the location of where they are transferring it.</td>

<td>Indeed. You seem to be quite invested in all of this, don't you?</td>

<td>007</td>
<td>Not particularly. I want to quickly deal with this Demon mess and quickly embark on searching for Agatha.</td>

<tr>

<td>Hm. Right. I promise that we will focus all our efforts on rescuing Agatha.</td>
