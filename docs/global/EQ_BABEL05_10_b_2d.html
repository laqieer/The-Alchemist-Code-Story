<td>001</td>
<td>It was my intention to decline, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Let me guess, you couldn't because you're on the job?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No, I am an adult. I was merely being polite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well, you did a great job. Here, have some marshmallows!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Please, you enjoy them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>They're so squishy and delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Marsh...mallows?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wouldn't you like some, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I-I told you! I'm not really here! I can't interact with things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ooh, they're so sweet! Squish, squish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>N-now that's just mean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Magic is merely a branch of Alchemy. Your country, Lustburg, has expanded upon it most successfully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lustburg... The matriarchal society and land of the witches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Matri...archal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yes, and even that is merely a twisted kind of order brought about by power run rampant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It is the curse of the Sacred Stone Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So Asmodeus...is a stone? A sacred one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't you know about the Sacred Stones?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Not a thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Is that true of everyone from your time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's true of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Anyway, what's this about a curse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>A very long time ago, there was a witch who made a pact with Asmodeus in order to proliferate the curse. She is known as Mother, for being the mother of sin and calamity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>When a male child is born of man and woman, it becomes an insect. Such was the disgusting curse she inflicted upon her people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(The power of Asmodeus...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's mostly women who possess the capacity for magic in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Those who are bereft of it are oppressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Wow. You've really done your homework on this! Here, have a scone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'd really rather some tea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What's a scone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You can...not have one, because you're not really here! What a shame!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Y-you...! You knew I couldn't...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ahem. Those who are bereft of it are oppressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Right. O-oppressed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The entire country is steeped in the tradition of matriarchy, in which its government and culture are also deeply-rooted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yet, some men from Lustburg—a select few—were once a part of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>According to the database contained within my monocle, there was a man called Wilhelm...and, of course, there was Othima, the previous captain of the 6th Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>However, even having made a successful career for themselves outside of Lustburg, they were always belittled upon their return. They were not allowed an iota of pride between them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It is not my intention to denounce the entire nation, however. I know that the Court Mage Order, for example—of which Lofia, here, is a member—exercises its powers appropriately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So those who can use magic are the ones who take care of the country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Court Mages are the highest-ranking mages in Lustburg. They are proficient in and knowledgeable of both magic and academia, and they use their powers to maintain public order both within and beyond their borders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>However, those with strong magical leanings are almost exclusively women.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We're the right people for the job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We have the power to protect nations, so we make use of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>There are also those like Michael, who may not wield the strongest magic, but are still recognized as Court Mages for qualities such as wisdom and work ethic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Just as there are those of us who believe that it would be better if the curse and the ridiculous discrimination simply disappeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I feel that way, and that's why I've been researching magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I've done what I can to protect my country. I went to those ruins, I found that book, and Milis, and I even...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>So why is it...? Why did things end up like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Discrimination brings nothing but misery. I wish it'd all just go away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Sometimes, I wonder why magic even exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Are you cold?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'm used to the cold, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I guess I'm still recovering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Here. Try eating this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It's a pickle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>A pick...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Go on. Have a nibble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Umgf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Bleuggghhhh! It's spicy! It burns! Bleugh! Gross!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Th-they are meant to be a little spicy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Yikes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Arrrgggghhh! It burns!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>To think, they're actually quite tasty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Y-you...! You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>This is my revenge for your staring earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Why don't you drink some tea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>T-tea. Th-that's a good...idea—arggghhhhh! It's so hot! It burns!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hahahahah! And there goes my revenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>E-eat snow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Hmhm. It was also an apology.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>For...what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I'm partial to spicy foods, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Oh. I get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I am sorry that I couldn't enjoy the sweets with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I-it's fine. I don't think I can enjoy spicy things...with you, either. Bleugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Hmhm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Perhaps it did sting a little, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It did warm you up as well, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Well, well, well. This was very thoughtful of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I was hoping to shock you with these skewers of whole water lizards, but I got carried away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I am sorry to have disappointed you, my dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Oh, it's fine! I had to run an errand for my grandma, and buy some presents, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>There has been an urgent matter of business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Oh, right! Lofy is out on some official Court Mage business, is she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>So, when is she coming back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I promised her that we'd eat sweets together again, and that I'd tell her all about my homeland!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Oh! And she said she'd teach me about how to be a gentlewoman like her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>It is likely that her return will take some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Aww, no! What a shame!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Oh, well! Anyway, you've got to try these water lizard skewers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>May I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Don't let them go to waste! They're really yummy, I promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>You've gotta tell Lofy how good they are, okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>She makes this disgusted face whenever I so much as mention water lizard cuisine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>If you recommend them, maybe she'll give one a try! They make you feel really great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Heheh! So eat up! I'll make more for the next time we see each other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Yes. Lady Lofia has a good friend in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Heheh... Heheheheheh! I guess so? I just love spending time with Lofy! It's so much fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>It is rather rude of her to have failed to greet you so many times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>The next time I see her, I will tell Lady Lofia that she ought to visit you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>You mean it?! Thanks! I'll be waiting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Ohohohohoh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I'm so excited!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I'll be waiting! I'll wait as long as it takes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Tell her she can come and see me anytime, okay?! Anytime!</td>
