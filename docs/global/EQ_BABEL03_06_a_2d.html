<td>What are you thinking, Hawk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>You're a man who doesn't waver when it comes to protecting the things he cares about. Even now, I can see that in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>What does it matter? This has nothing to do with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Then why did you say all that? Carla, she...cares for you. You can't tell me you don't already know that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>It'd be easier if she hated me. I want her to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>So that's it? Don't tell me you intend to handle this situation by yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Hey, Balt. Don't you think the stars are beautiful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Stars?! Hawk, have you completely lost it? Why are you talking about those at a time like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I like this land, you know. I was born here. It's my home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>But there are few people who feel the same way. Everyone abandons the desert in favor of moving to other countries. I want to change that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I can't just stand around and watch the desert wither away like this. I want to be able to protect the future for the children who grow up here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>So I will protect the desert. If I have to play the bad guy to do it, then so be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Then let me go with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I have reinforcements coming already. There is something else I would like you to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>And what would that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I want you to take care of Carla for me. She's...special.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I will protect her, even in death. I feel as strongly about protecting her as I do about the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>So...you do care for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>It's not just about how I feel personally. There is a reason that she must be protected, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>A reason?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>She's a descendant of the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>What?! A-are you sure?! If that's true...well, it would explain that power of hers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>When Carla used that power, I felt a strange sensation envelop me. That must have been the Sephiran power of purification!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>That's right. It was Spiritbonding, a special technique used only by the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>S-Spiritbonding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>A part of you already knew, huh? She must be protected for the future of this desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>If she can learn to control her power, she might be able to purify the land here. Even now, although it may be faint...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Her powers of purification and regeneration are already having an effect. See for yourself. The quality of the soil where the seeds are has changed thanks to her power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>But if that power of hers grows...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Then people will begin to covet her Alchemia. People like the ones who are coming for us now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Not only that, but Carla is one of those Sephira who is marked with a sephirah—something that has all but been lost to us today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>She has a mark that proves her pure lineage and she will be targeted for her reserves of Alchemia as a result.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>So that's what this was all about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>That's why they mustn't learn of her existence; for her sake, and for the sake of the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>There are those among the nobility who would use her for their political means. Someone must protect her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>She is the hope of the desert, you know, and that smile of hers... It's really something special.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>She has a strange charm to her. Have you noticed your aching heart being soothed by her presence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Yes. At some point, I got caught up in her energy, and just naturally started becoming more hopeful again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>It's not just power. Her very heart is capable of purifying things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Is there anyone more suited to restoring the desert?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>That's why you must protect her in my stead. I pray that you will. I want you to promise me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>You should do it yourself. Stop talking like you're going to your death!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Do you swear it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Fine... I swear it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Thank you, Balt. You mustn't follow me, all right? Keep your promise to protect her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I have faith; faith that the people of the desert are trying to protect it in their own way—faith that you will be able to overcome this crisis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Even if I should fall, I am certain that the seeds of restoration have already taken root in everyone's hearts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Death isn't pointless. This is how I will protect the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I'm glad I was able to entrust you with this task. Goodbye, Balt... Take care of Carla. I'm counting on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Hawk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>I can't waste time like this... I need to do something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I'd appreciate it if you stopped right there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/noin.png" alt="Neun" height="128"><br>Neun</td>
<td>What's this? Isn't this the bastard who was eavesdropping on us earlier? I guess there must be a village around here somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>There is nothing for you here. I cannot allow you to proceed, and so...I have come to stop you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zyva.png" alt="Sieba" height="128"><br>Sieba</td>
<td>By yourself? You're really underestimating us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I am not underestimating you. When I left earlier, it was only so that I could let everyone know about the danger—and arrange for reinforcements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Even if nobody comes...that only means that everyone has time to escape. So standing against you here will not be for naught. I will buy them time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>The seeds have been planted. Even if it takes time for them to sprout...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Those seeds will grow. Even if I should fall, my life will not end here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>My final wish has been taken care of, so I can stand here without regret!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/noin.png" alt="Neun" height="128"><br>Neun</td>

<td>Nngh... Arrrgggghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zyva.png" alt="Sieba" height="128"><br>Sieba</td>
<td>It doesn't look like you'll be able to hold us up for very long. Neun, allow me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I told you. I won't...let...you...go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/noin.png" alt="Neun" height="128"><br>Neun</td>
<td>You're so weak, it's pathetic! You really want more? Are you an idiot?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>That's right. I am an idiot...and I'm weak. That doesn't mean I can't stop you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Arrrgghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zyva.png" alt="Sieba" height="128"><br>Sieba</td>
<td>You're incomprehensible. How...unsightly. It's time for you to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I won't die so easily! Who decided that I couldn't stand up to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/noin.png" alt="Neun" height="128"><br>Neun</td>
<td>Ahahahahahaha! As if you could! Those words sound ridiculous coming from a worm like you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I always thought that...it would be so wonderful if...I myself could shoulder Carla's burdens...so she didn't have to carry them alone...but I can't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Not if I don't have a mark like she does. At least...I could research anything that would help me be of use to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>So that someday, even if I couldn't take her place...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I would be able to help her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zyva.png" alt="Sieba" height="128"><br>Sieba</td>
<td>Perhaps he's gone mad from fear. We should put him out of his misery at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Allow me to educate you. Among the Sephira, there are those who are marked...and those who aren't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zyva.png" alt="Sieba" height="128"><br>Sieba</td>
<td>What are you blabbering on about all of a sudden? Such things have nothing to do with you...or your imminent death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Only those who are marked can use Spiritbonding. However, when certain conditions are met, even those who are not marked become capable of using it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>By opening themselves up to the Alchemia of all those who have died here... By pouring their own Alchemia into the earth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Causing it to regenerate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/noin.png" alt="Neun" height="128"><br>Neun</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>By bathing in the light of the stars, spilling one's own blood into the earth, and letting it soak into the sands! In this way, even I can...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Through the circle of life, I can temporarily mimic Spiritbonding!</td>
</tr>
