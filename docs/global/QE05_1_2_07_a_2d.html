<td>Heh. You really are just like Judah. Now then, it is time for your trial.</td>

<td>Iakov</td>
<td>This is Spiritbonding! A secret technique that can be wielded only by one such as yourself, one with the decimum sephirah.</td>
</tr>

<td>Iakov</td>
<td>A technique in which you summon forth Phantoms to do your bidding!</td>

<td>Phantoms?!</td>

<td>I was never any match for Judah, so this is my limit. You should be able to do much more.</td>

<td>Now, show me what you can do, Kamui! Show me what Judah saw in you!</td>

<td>Perfect. To be able to recreate what I did by seeing it just once... Only someone with the potential to be the Protector could do so.</td>

<td>Stand up, Kamui. The trial has just begun. You still have more to learn.</td>

<td>Now that you have shown that you can do the last technique, you must know that there is a gate within yourself that you must open!</td>
