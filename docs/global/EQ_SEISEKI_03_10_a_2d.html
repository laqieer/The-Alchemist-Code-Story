<td>Vice-Captain Monzein!</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Ah, you caught up! Is Kagura already able to move?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes. Thanks to a talented doctor. More importantly, where's Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm certain he's here, but there are so many rooms. I'm checking each one carefully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>There will be no need for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What are you doing coming out of the wood work? Have you got tired of the chase?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Indeed. I'm ready now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'll ask you one more time. Seida, where is the Sacred Stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I already told you I didn't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heheh. Lying isn't goodâ€”especially for one who is part of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This spell...let's just say that it may respond when the person under it lies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh?! Then he knows about you and the Sacred Stone, Seida!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Heheh. Thank you, young ladies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Actually, all this spell does is light up red when pointed at a target.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Whaaat...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So you tricked us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Indeed. Thanks to that I now know exactly where the Sacred Stone is located.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Seida. I guess I can't make fun of Kanon anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Don't worry about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Either way, it doesn't change the fact that we're going to defeat him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Fine. Give it your best shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Heheh. After I defeat you lot, I will pry out the location of the Sacred Stone from you while extinguishing your lives one at a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We won't let you! We will use the light of us four Holy Guards to shatter your darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't forget about me too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Of course! Everyone, let's go!</td>
