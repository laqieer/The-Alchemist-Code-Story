<td>Match point! I win!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You got me, fair and square. You really are something, Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's all thanks to these horns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yeah. I'm a little jealous, I won't lie. Those horns are a direct connection back to Mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's because of them, though, that we have to stay hidden like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I don't care. I'm still jealous. Always will be! Plus...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's thanks to those horns that we were able to grow up with Lady Mitsuha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, I'm jealous right back! You have a strong heart in you, Sumeragi. Just like Father did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I guess the grass really is always greener on the other side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Eheheh. I guess so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Good. You're smiling again. That's how it should be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I bet that's the spitting image of how Mother would've looked when she smiled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And you probably look just like Father! Maybe. I'm guessing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, speaking of which, I really need to gather up all these drawings. I got a little carried away reading Father's journal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What's this a picture of? People and animals, side by side. Looks like they're all having fun together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's my interpretation of a story from long, long ago that Father mixed in with one of his recipes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It tells of a time when humans and animals lived as equals right here in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Humans and animals...lived as equals?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah. It's hard to imagine, isn't it? But I found it really interesting, so I tried to draw it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Even the mighty tigers and leopards lived side by side with giant serpents, which we'd just see as monsters to be vanquished nowadays.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But back then, they all got along just fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's how I think things are supposed to be, since back in those days, it was just completely normal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And that's also why I believe in what our parents were trying to do. They wanted to put Wadatsumi back on its proper pathâ€”to return things to the way they used to be all those years ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wow, okay. I had no idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>One day, you and I will be able to show everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That our parents weren't wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yeah. All of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Then people will stop turning against Lady Mitsuha, too, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It's...good that we were born, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well, yeah! Don't ever doubt that. Imagine how sad Mother and Father would be if they thought you felt any differently!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And...Lady Mitsuha, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yeah... Yeah! You're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I think it's kind of our destiny. Just like our parents, we need to come together and find some way to create an everlasting peace for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We need to change what normal is for people. Today's "normal" is pretty screwed up. But I believe we can bring back the Wadatsumi of old, if we try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No, it's not just that we can. We have to! It's something only the two of us can pull off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Let's make Wadatsumi into the country Mother and Father always thought it could be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Then Lady Mitsuha will start smiling a lot more often, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yeah, as long as you stop bothering her, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hah! Well, then that settles it! We're doing this! For ourselves, for our parents, for Wadatsumi, and for Lady Mitsuha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>There you go. That's the face, right there. That's the "normal" I'm looking for from you, Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Thank you, Sumeragi! I'm really feeling motivated now. I truly believe we can make all of this happen, as long as we stick together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Me too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>This was our vow to each other that day. And we would never stop striving to fulfill it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>We existed somewhere between human and demon, but continued to support each other in pursuit of a world where such distinctions would no longer matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But in our noble pursuit, we remained blissfully unaware of the stage being set all around us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>For it was around this time that an even greater malice was poised to envelop Wadatsumi altogether...</td>
</tr>
