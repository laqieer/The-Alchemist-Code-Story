<td>Tenacious, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's that strange technique again! But still, they're only human!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Then they shouldn't be able to repel this! "Time is merely ephemeral..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yet tragedy is everlasting—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Their Space-Time Manipulation is...! Watch out! They're going to disrupt the time within you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hah! Too slow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Who's slow? Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>On it, Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What are you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Space-Time Manipulation... It is indeed astonishing, with many aspects I still don't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But I do know it cannot activate without meddling with the magil of this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Then all we have to do is saturate this entire area with the magil of the Gula Belt Region!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Getting in our way again...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There! Finally, an opening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What...?! Where did this blizzard come from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This is like when the town was attacked!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hahaha! Oh, I'm sorry! Did I forget to mention that we were just stalling for time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This is the end for you all. This world will now drown in waves of Lust!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The Matter is reacting to an incredible amount of magil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Here it comes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I imagined that her nest would be somewhere in the center of this frozen field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Never did I think this whole ice floe was within her gullet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(This immense pressure, just from standing before her...! Cursed Beasts truly are terribly extraordinary!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(Can we really defeat this beast? A being that subsumes the entirety of this region?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hahahah! Do you fear the Cursed Beast, boy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>To tell you the truth, I am too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That monster took everything from me. My family, my home... Everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's why we need to kill that wretched thing, right here and now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I don't care if Cursed Beasts are comparable to gods... Even if they're calamity incarnate...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>For us to survive, there is no other way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That's right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(I vowed to change this world, to create a new natural order! Now is the time to stand my ground!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Thank you for that reality check. Will you lend me a hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Don't make me repeat myself. You're helping us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Grrrooooaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What's wrong, Emmel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The Matter's power suddenly started weakening the moment Asmodeus appeared... Also, something strange is happening with my Spiritbonding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>This is the Lustrous Domain... A shrine created and ruled by Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It seems that this domain suppresses the magil of those not saturated in Lust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Your sister is deeply connected to the Cursed Beast of Gluttony, is she not? She may be hindered from wielding her powers at her fullest potential because of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>So, we cannot depend on the Matter...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What do you think we should do, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Still no signal from the airship. We'll simply have to endure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Endure the situation we're in? I suppose we don't have the luxury of preserving strength for later.</td>
