<td>Nothing but wild animals.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wonder if Professor Minerva has better luck with that crystal of hers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Meep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Find something, Chip?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Chip scampers up Soren's arm and peeks at the shining creature trotting closely behind it, licking its lips.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Arf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Aren't you one of Eira's foxes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Big Bro!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Eira! Weren't you taking a nap?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Does anyone know you're here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Eira hear...singing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Pretty...voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Singing...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There you are, Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh, hello, little one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...Hello!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Teacher...sing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Me? Not one for the stage myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's not what you meant? Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Minerva pulls out her crystal and begins concentrating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>A soft hum begins to permeate the frozen air as it resonates in low tones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Shiny...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh, dear... Is everyone all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yeah, but that voice... I heard it too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The singing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ah, it makes sense now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I believe Lachesis could have a strong connection to Alchemia particles, specifically those of the Elylon Teg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>In this regard, Eira's signature may be synergetic with hers, allowing the child to perceive her in such a manner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Proximity may play a part, but to what extent I am unsure. A lead is better than nothing, however!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But...is she a Construct? Or something else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>A little more difficult to deduce, I'm afraid. Perhaps she is a different project?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>And if Goetia is after both her and Eira, then it stands to reason they have need of this power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Eira may be one of the "keys", for if it was only an Elylon Teg clansman they needed, they could have taken Emrys instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Bad people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Eira...cause trouble?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It was never your fault, Eira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Come on, what say we head back for dinner? It's getting late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Okay, Big Bro.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>To make contact with such a being, Goetia would have need of a prodigious amount of Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>For a mercy, this does mean that, like Atropos, she cannot be sequestered within the country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And if Eira can perceive her even from here, we may be closer to her location than expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>All that remains is for us to get to her before Goetia finds out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Easier said than done, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>One step at a time, my dear Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>- Minerva's Residence -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>So, if I got this straight... We're looking for Lachesis by following her phantom singing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That is the gist of it, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I fear that our movements may rouse the attention of any Goetia operative who happens to be scouring the area, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>No worries, Teach. We'll be on the lookout to cause a scene if necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>A diversionary force, hmm? It might just work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Granted that being out of Slothstein would embolden them to take more drastic measures, they won't hesitate to attack us on sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Heh. It'll be their last mistake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Then Eira and I will remain here for news of Shion while I conduct further research on our singing friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Eira...foxes...help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That leaves myself and Blair, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Good thing I thought to bring my toolbox along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Maybe we'll run into illegally disposed scrap I can use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Right, everyone. Let's get to work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Wait for me, Roxanne.</td>
