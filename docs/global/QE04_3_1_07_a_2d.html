<td>How do you know...about the Sprite Trio Discourse?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I am well aware of who all of you are...Wind Shaman of Fuu and you, witch of Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>When it comes to bartering, information speaks louder than money. You people are too...narrow-minded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's time you realized how your narrow-mindedness will prove ineffective in protecting the future of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's exactly to protect the future of Saga...that we must hold the Sprite Trio Discourse! Please, lend us your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well then, let me ask you this. What do you think of the current state of Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The...current state?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...At this rate, Saga will be consumed by the Jam. It will be invaded by the Gluttony army! In order to stop that, we...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The only crisis you face is that of your own senses. I am asking about the current state of Saga...where individual tribes depend fully on Asena and have closed themselves off from each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...I don't understand...what you're talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That is why...you cannot change the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Seriously! All of Saga is in danger right now! You could at least try to be a little more cooperative!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>There is no need for cooperation. My plan is moving along smoothly. I will protect Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Still...the Sprite Trio Discourse is an order stated in the law of Saga, isn't it?! You are under obligation to follow it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Death to those oppose the law...wasn't it? If you mean to kill me then do so...just like they killed Alia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tehre...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And what happened to Saga as a result of being bound by this alleged law? Well, see for yourself! There are more important matters for all of you to concern yourselves with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If you truly desire to have me present at the discourse, then use your power to convince me. I'll judge whether you are worthy enough to change the future of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...Tehre!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If you refuse to make your case...I may as well pass judgment now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We've no choice... Let's do this!</td>
