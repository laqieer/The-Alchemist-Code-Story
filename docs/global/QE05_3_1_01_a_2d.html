<td>We must take action. The people are preparing an uprising, and the nobility... Now that they have privatized the military, they are absorbed in expanding their dominion.</td>

<td>Ah, Seriolde. My blood, my scion. How naive you are, Seriolde Ceclidis IV.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Order the military to suppress the uprising. They are now the hands and feet of the nobility. They would do anything to protect the benefits that it gives them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>B-but...think of the casualties the people will suffer! The entire country will fall to ruin!</td>

<td>Ah, it's you. I'm fine, but I suggest you leave this country.</td>

<td>In any case, civil war is not the only danger we face in this country. You shouldn't be here.</td>

<td>Me?</td>
