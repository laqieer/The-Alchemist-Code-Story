<td>Dangit! It wasn't supposed to be like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Why is this happening?! We were promised a life of luxury if the army took Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Who was it that instigated all of this in the first place?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>General Georgios is dead?! The Flame-Armed General is dead?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's a conspiracy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>It's the nobles! They're making the army their own with our tax money!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Y-you're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes... Yes, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Who's at fault?! Who can we blame?! Who stole our profits?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We must take action. The people are preparing an uprising, and the nobility... Now that they have privatized the military, they are absorbed in expanding their dominion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This country... Gluttony Foss is on the verge of collapse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Please allow me to make a public declaration. We must admit that the Saga expedition was a folly and reprove the nobles of their rampage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If we do not—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I will not allow this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>F-Father, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Those dang cattle... They've grown fat off of my blessings, and yet they still demand more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hmph. I suppose that is what makes them citizens of Gluttony Foss. They take, devour, and yet still their appetite continues to swell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>They had better prove that it was worth my time to feed them as I have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Wh-what are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The people are gasping for air, drowning in insecurity! They're losing hope for tomorrow, and yet reaching out with desperate hands in search of salvation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Is it not our duty, as the administrators of the state, to provide them with that salvation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ah, Seriolde. My blood, my scion. How naive you are, Seriolde Ceclidis IV.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It may not have been wise to provide you with tutors of ill breed. You still fail to understand the true nature of the governance of this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Order the military to suppress the uprising. They are now the hands and feet of the nobility. They would do anything to protect the benefits that it gives them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>B-but...think of the casualties the people will suffer! The entire country will fall to ruin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That is all fine. Thirst and hunger, the gluttonous impulses, these are what propel this country forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The time for harvest is nearing. We must drive the people further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Grasshoppers cannot become locusts until they swarm. Ah, I feel it! The time for the resurrection ceremony is upon us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Heheh... Hahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I cannot let this be! This country will be ruined if this is allowed to continue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But what can I do? I am merely a puppet sitting on a false throne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Lord Seriolde? Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ah, it's you. I'm fine, but I suggest you leave this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The discontent of the people runs deep. They would reproach those who are even slightly associated with the nobility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>B-but Your Highness—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Do not call me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm not the true king of Gluttony Foss. You know this, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I am nothing more than a puppet. I exist only to hide my father's—that monster's—truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>There is no end to his appetite. The slaves we buy are insufficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I daresay that the recent incident of those children going missing could also be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>In any case, civil war is not the only danger we face in this country. You shouldn't be here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That may be, but I am a noble of Gluttony Foss. I have a responsibility to my family name. Please, you must allow me to remain by your side until the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I will not! Don't you understand? I do not have the power to keep even a single person safe from harm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I cannot protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I am powerless against my father's rampage, and so I must ask you to do something for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>There is an ancient tribe living in the Desert Zone south of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We need to make contact with them and ask them for their help. I believe that this is something that only you can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>However slightly, you have inherited their blood and their powers. They may just lend an ear to your words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Marie, my love, please help me save this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The Sephira—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>My lord, I guarantee you that I shall gain their favor. Please, be well until I return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Come on, get up. We're almost at the oasis. You can make it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Y-yes, sir. Thank you, Captain Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I think my old self would have told all of them to take it easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You must be getting used to being in a leadership position. We all know that now is not the time to be idle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I guess you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It's been two weeks since we entered the Desert Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It might be wise to find a village we can rest up in for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>We are low on food and water. We should at least replenish our supplies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Hopefully the next oasis will allow us a brief sojourn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Well, just one more dune to climb! Over that dune is the oasis where we can—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Is everything all right, Captain Logi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I...just saw someone on top of that dune.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You did? I didn't see anyone. Hey! Did any of you see someone over on that dune?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Never mind, I must have just made a mistake. Let's hurry. I have a bad feeling about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yes, sir! All right, everybody! One last push!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Huzzaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Sorry, but I ain't sellin' you lot nothin'!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>But...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You're them Blue Tongues I've been hearin' about, ain't ya? The remnants of the Blue Flame Guard and Lizard Brigade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Some folks praise you as a righteous militia, but some of us see you as the leftover fragments of the great sinner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It ain't my place to say, but even Northern Pride's been makin' their way into the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I doubt any merchant would dare show you lot support with those kinds of eyes watchin'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>That's all I'm willin' to say. Go along, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>This is troubling. I didn't think the Blue Tongues would be known out here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>No luck, I take it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Nothing. They yelled at us for being the remnants of the Blue Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I never expected the Holy Guard's influence to stretch all the way out to this remote region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Until just a few years ago this place still had some merchants with rebellious tendencies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>The Holy Guard is growing increasingly active all over Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Much like they did when that conflict arose in Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>It might not be long before we have to take up arms again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Right—but first, we have to find out for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>We must know the truth behind what is happening to Babel, and the truth regarding the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>It is up to us to stop their schemes, so that no more blood and no more tears of grief are shed upon this continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>We have nowhere else to go. We will follow you to the end, Captain Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>We will be needing supplies first, at any rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Where can we go? The merchants here aren't willing to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Well, the merchant over there said that no one would help us with "those eyes" watching.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>The Desert Zone has always existed in between competing forces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Places like these have been known to give rise and fall to rebellious forces. I'm sure that is the case, even to this day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Captain Logi? What is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>That merchant from earlier gave me this letter of introduction. A courier guild—the Fruit Peddlers, huh? Let's go see what they're all about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Welcome, welcome! What can our guild do for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Whatever your package, we'll deliver it safely to any place in the desert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I was told that even we might be able to do business here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Do you have a letter of introduction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Would this be it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Ah! You must be the Blue Tongues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>This desert is full of some rather shady people. We happen to have a lot of opportunities to get information about them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Our boss praised that rebellious spirit of yours very highly. It's good to see that you've kept up, even after being chased out of your country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Of course, we cannot offer you supplies for free, however. I'm sure you understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Absolutely. We don't have much on hand, but we will pay what we can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Oh, no. Your money's no good here, but you do have something far more valuable that you can offer us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
