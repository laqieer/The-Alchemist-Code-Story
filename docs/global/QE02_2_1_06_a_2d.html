<td>The road to the Central Intelligence Administration...should be this way, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Bzz... I've heard that the destination has moved up ahead. It should come into view soon.</td>

<td>Alkemono, are there any signs of a trap?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>There are Guard Droids, aye, but their numbers aren't especially large.</td>

<td>006</td>
<td>You still haven't answered my question. Why did you help us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Bzz... As my neural circuit has already reached the end of its use...I was left there to await dismantling.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Alkaroid, you're interested in me, aye?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes. We are nothing more than machines who follow human commands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But...you are different. You seem to be fulfilled...with the human-like feeling of satisfaction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hmm. I don't really understand, aye. But I'm happy with Fiona and everyone here!</td>

<td>Not good! The Hounds are after us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Tsk! No time for leisure conversation. We need to shake them off our tail!</td>
