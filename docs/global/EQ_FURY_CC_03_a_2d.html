<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I have to confess, I'm not fond of my own name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Button?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>My family saw it as a cute name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Also because a button is an object to fasten things together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They saw it as a fitting name for someone who would serve the royal family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's always sounded weird to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's nice, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Button.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What do you want it to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Button... How beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Which Button are you talking about? My name, or a button...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The fitting one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So, the one on clothing, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Maybe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Honestly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Heh. It's you I'm talking about, silly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh, oh! Oh my goodness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Please, would you... Would you shake my hand?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>A-are you talking to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Y-yes. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. Of course if you don't want to, I wouldn't presume to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's just that you're a real live knight! Look, Ikasa! As I live and breathe, a knight! In the flesh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's hurtful, Button...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm on patrol right now, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh, of course! Of course! How silly of me. You're on duty! I didn't mean to disturb you. I'm so uncultured, you know. I don't know anything, anything at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There are many knights more esteemed than I stationed at Spandau Castle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I intend to visit the castle too, of course! It's just that seeing knights like you protecting the capital, watching the people here go about their days...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's so much more exciting than seeing this place in pictures! It's just... This is it, you know? I'm really here! It's indescribable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>She's like this with everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If you feel that strongly about it... Very well. Let's shake hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Thank you so muuuuch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm really sorry about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes, I'm really sorry about this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmm... That's a rather exotic outfit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh! How rude of me. Where are my manners?! My name is Button.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I am a shrine maiden of Wadatsumi traveling the world to further my studies and understanding of each culture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>How curious. I thought that Wadatsumi only allowed passage to and from Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well, exceptions are made when you're from the line of shrine maidens who serve the royal family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Conflict has died down in Wadatsumi of late, so traversing the border is not as difficult as it once was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That is good! A promising sign of peace. I must apologize to you for my rudeness and ignorance, my lady. I had no idea you were of noble lineage. Please forgive me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh, no! Not at all! You weren't rude! There's nothing to forgive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Thank you for your kindness, Lady Shrine Maiden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>N-no, thank you! Thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I didn't know you were the fangirl type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Fan...girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What is the right choice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I keep asking myself that question, over and over again. To live up to my name. To become the savior of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Right versus wrong, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yet I still don't know the answer to my own question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Don't peek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'm going to take a bath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Wh-why would I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I mean, I've grown a lot. Bet you're curious to see how much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I am not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You haven't changed much, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>These clothes just make me look very slim, okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Heheh. No peeking, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Oh, oh! Oh my goodness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Please, would you... Would you shake my hand?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Huh? Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Y-yes. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. Of course if you don't want to, I wouldn't presume to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>It's just that you're a real live knight! Look, Ikasa! As I live and breathe, a knight! In the flesh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Really, that's hurtful, Button...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I'm on patrol right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Oh, of course! Of course! How silly of me. You're on duty! I didn't mean to disturb you. I'm so uncultured, you know. I don't know anything, anything at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Okay. Why not? Let's shake hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Thank you so muuuuch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I'm really sorry about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yes, I'm really sorry about this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Are you going to be like this with everyone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Everything's just so...so new, and wonderful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Heh. Total country bumpkin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Still, I must say that none of the seafood I've tried so far even comes close to beating Wadatsumi's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Didn't know it was a competition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Hee hee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Y'know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ahem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>What about me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Hm? What about you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Don't you have something to say to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>No...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I'm a knight too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I could ask you the same question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Don't you have something to say to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What're you apologizing for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Not power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>No. Not power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>That's why you're accompanying me, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Having a Paladin accompany me on my travels is very...extravagant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>My father taught me about the use of Wadatsumi's Chakra and Samurai.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Yeah, but they've got different names in Babel. Chakra is called Alchemia and Samurai are known as Phantom Soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Alchemia is used in Alchemy. Alchemy can be used to summon Phantom Soldiers, but to do so is forbidden on the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>So the power that is a part of everyday life in Wadatsumi, and the Samurai we summon...are forbidden here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Do you wonder why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>No. I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I figured. You would know better than most how devastating the abuse of Alchemy can be. Just look at the ongoing conflict in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>The Magna Code dictates that the only people who are allowed to use Alchemy are members of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>As such, my role is to protect you, but also to monitor you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Doesn't sound great, does it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I don't mind. In fact, I support it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>You already knew, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I believe that this world should be connected by something other than power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Oh, oh! Oh my goodness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Please, would you... Would you shake my hand?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Huh? Are you talkin' to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Y-yes. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. Of course if you don't want to, I wouldn't presume to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>It's just that you're a gladiator! An actual living, breathing, talking gladiator! Can you believe it, Ikasa? We're speaking with a gladiator!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Wh-what is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Oh, nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I'm gettin' ready for my next match, y'know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Oh, of course! Of course! How silly of me. You're preparing! I didn't mean to disturb you. I'm so uncultured, you know. I don't know anything, anything at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Well, whatever. I've got time for a handshake. Put 'er there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Thank you so muuuuch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I'm really sorry about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Yes, I'm really sorry about this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Whoops! Sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Oh, no, I should apologize. Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Bwahahaha! You idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Um...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Check your pockets! Are you missin' anythin', lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Oh, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I don't think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Wait a minute...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>My luggage! It's all gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Thief! Someone catch that lout!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I-it's all right! Please, don't worry about me. You've got your match to get to. I wouldn't want you to be late!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>A-are you sure, lady? Are you gonna be all right on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>We'll be fine, I'm sure. After all—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Wait... On my own? But I'm not alone. Ikasa's right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>She's gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Guess she left you to fend for yourself, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>You okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>She promised me.</td>
