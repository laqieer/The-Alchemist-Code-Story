<td>Roxanne finds herself dealing with yet another headache in the form of Shion, who has arrived at her mansion with a message.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, color me surprised. You actually ARE here on business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>As much as your frustration amuses me, the fact that Soren is incapacitated is no laughing matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>In fact, your assailant may very well be the same as the one Lord Zheng Yi encountered in Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>One of two who made an attempt on his life.</td>

<td>What?! So she's a member of this "Projekt Goetia" you mentioned...</td>

<td>Some time ago, the nobles in Greed Dike had called upon my lord to force the whereabouts of Atropos from him...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No, I do not have any plans to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The Atropos Project has been shut down definitively. There is no reason to divulge its location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But what of the remains? Are you implying it's simply sitting there, waiting to be found?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If it falls into the wrong hands, the consequences could be dire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Far better for it to be recovered than to lie in an abandoned tunnel somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I thank you for your concern, but this is my burden to carry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Now, if you'll excuse me, I must take my leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This has been a most generous feast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>*sigh*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I suppose my sins will haunt me for a while yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>As long as we are taking steps in the right direction, it doesn't matter how small they are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And I will be there with you, my lord. Every step of the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Asuka...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Come, let us make for home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>True love! How sweet! How positively heart-melting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It seems to me this lovely pair have themselves a romantic little night lined up!</td>

<td>The girl with the immense greatsword merely stares unblinkingly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh dear! Not one for words, I suppose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I hope our happy couple will be more eager to talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Who are you? What do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Good questions, but I'll answer them after I'm through with Mister Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh, how I yearn to pry delicious little secrets from your lord over there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I wonder how my name will sound on his lips?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Not a step closer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Temper, temper!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Very well. If you so wish it, you may grovel for your life as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Red!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Get to work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...Yes, Nesha.</td>
