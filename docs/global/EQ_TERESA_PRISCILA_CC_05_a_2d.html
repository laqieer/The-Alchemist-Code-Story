<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Actually, we came to investigate a suspicious battle taking place near the Envylian border.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>In doing so, we noticed a sole combatant standing her ground against a ludicrous number of aggressors. We couldn't exactly ignore that, you understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>You led your pursuers out to this remote location so as not to catch any civilians in the crossfire, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>And this... This is what you've been doing, constantly, since leaving the knighthood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>No matter where we go, we just can't seem to avoid hearing new rumors of the Ruinmaker's exploits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>You asked me if I liked flowers. The question is, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>I do. They help me forget all the hate, if but for a fleeting moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>He loved flowers too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>And I'm sure for him as well, they served to help calm his nerves as he struggled, day in and day out, to find some means of ending all the war that mires this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>I know not from whence the hate you wish to forget originates, but I can at least be a comrade in arms, fighting alongside you to achieve our shared goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>Interesting. I've underestimated you. It would seem you are true knights, of the most honorable variety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>So, is your fight ended?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>Unfortunately not. The struggle continues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I've destroyed the most crucial documents of those experiments, but some of the information contained within them yet survives...in my head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>To put it simply, I believe I am the most volatile threat to peace now. As a result of my mission, I am being pursued, and this pursuit has the potential to incite great violence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>You don't seem the type to disclose any information even should you be tortured, though. But I suppose your pursuers may not be quite so convinced of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>Well, there are also a few less critical documents I have yet to find. But the task of locating and disposing of those is about the limit of what I can still accomplish before the tides turn against me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>So that will be the end of your mission, then? I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Should I happen to come across any such documents, you may rest assured that I'll gladly burn them in your stead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Not for you, mind! But in the name of peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>

<td>I heard you were fighting around these parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lami.png" alt="Lamia" height="128"><br>Lamia</td>
<td>I've issued a general evacuation of the closest village. I figured this would be your preference, all else being equal...to keep the populace safe from harm, just in case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lami.png" alt="Lamia" height="128"><br>Lamia</td>
<td>And of course, it's my preference as well.</td>

<td>I owe everything to your guidance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hah! I barely taught you a thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lami.png" alt="Lamia" height="128"><br>Lamia</td>
<td>You fight a battle to bring an end to all conflict, and claim that you've taught me nothing? No, no! In my eyes, you are a jasmine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Which, in the language of flowers, means...?</td>
</tr>

<td>A bringer of great happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lami.png" alt="Lamia" height="128"><br>Lamia</td>
<td>I fought by your side to end all wars, and in the time you spent training me, I came to truly understand the gravity of your mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>And I cannot overstate what a model student you've been, Lamia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>Perhaps I need not even put my final wishes to words, as I'm certain you have some inkling of what it is that I want you to do for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>But allow me to say it still: I want, more than anything, for you to be the one to remove this overt source of conflict from the world. I want you...to terminate me.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>Stop, Lamia! She's in no position to put up a fight! If you do this, you'll be the one whoâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lami.png" alt="Lamia" height="128"><br>Lamia</td>
<td>It's fine, Priscilla. This is what I want as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>But, that...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Let's go, Priscilla. There may yet be hostiles in the vicinity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>This is a significant moment for the two of them. We mustn't disrupt it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
