<td>Look at you! You've got this sparring thing down! This is great! How about...this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You handled that one well, too! You're pretty good, you know that? Your injuries seem to have healed well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I could say the same of you, Carla. I'm glad we're on the same side. You're stronger than I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I think you're amazing, Balt. I could never fight like that, myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It looks like we're evenly matched at the moment! Let's have a little break and then go one more round.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>All right. I'm up for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huzzzzzaaaaahhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What is this power?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Carla, stop! You can't control it yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ngh....!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Carla?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Heheh. I guess that didn't go so well. What am I gonna do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That power of yours is too strong. You must be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>By the gods... What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's just this power I have. It's kind of "hrmph," but I know if I do it right, it'll go "bam"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But it just won't go "fwooosh" like I want it to. It just ends up going "floop."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I...didn't understand any of that, but I do know that if you keep pushing yourself you won't be able to move... Please don't make me worry about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I know, I know, but if I master this power, I can use it to help you protect the desert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I need to learn to control it. That's why I can't afford to be down—ngh! Crap, I still can't stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I understand how you feel. I still need to get stronger. I never want to experience such hopelessness ever again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I see... So you've got a lot on your shoulders too, huh? Let's go another round when I can stand up again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Carla... You're going too far. Just being able to stand doesn't mean you should keep sparring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm sure that when you have something you want to protect, you'll be able to control that power of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's just a hunch. Now, then. I'm going to go do some shopping at the oasis near here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh, wait, don't go yet! I'll go with you once we've gone another round.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You can't even stand! If I wait for you to finish, it'll be too late. I'll be fine on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Are you certain? I've heard rumors lately that the villages near here are being raided, one after the other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hahah. I'll be fine. It's not far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Balt, take care of Carla for me while I'm gone, all right? I'll see you both later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Is this oasis nearby? Will he really be all right on his own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yeah. We usually go together, but we've never been attacked before. I'm sure he'll be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>To be honest, I'm a little worried, too, but worrying about it won't help anything. So let's go another round...in a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Tch... What's with these guys?! They wouldn't answer our questions, and now they're rebelling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This is proof that there are survivors of the Sephira here. There would be no reason for them to resist, otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Enough! They've tried to cheat us, right?! That means we can crush them! Right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>True... I was hoping that we could be discreet, but if we cannot gather information that way, we may have to change tactics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I must say, this request from Greed Dike has really piqued my interest. The survivors of the Sephira, said to possess more Alchemia than ordinary humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If we can capture them, we may find ourselves one step closer to achieving the manifestation of Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We may also find something related to the great tree, Sephiron. I'm sure Sol will be pleased.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>All right! Let's get rid of this scum and head back victorious, gifts in hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Don't forget that we're here only at Greed Dike's request. However, for our own purposes, I won't deny us the chance to make a brilliant show of destroying them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That's what I like to hear! Huh...? Hey! Who's that bastard sneaking around over there?! Come here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Where do you think you're going?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Neun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Why did you stop me?! I could've killed him in a second!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Please try making use of that space between your ears every now and again. We have already destroyed most of the villages in this region. We need a new source of information, see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hmph. So we'll use him as bait?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Let's follow him. I'm sure he will lead us to another village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>All right, but now that I'm all worked up, I'd better get to have some fun soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We will find the survivors of the Sephira...so let us make quick work of these insubordinate fools!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Haa...haa... Did they say Greed Dike?! W-with a whole country behind this...I have no hope of doing anything on my own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Think, Hawk! At this rate, the desert will be...! I have to do something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What're you rushing around for, Hawk? Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>We have to leave. Now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Wha—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Did something happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I saw the people who are going around destroying villages. They'll be coming here next.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I see... So those weren't just rumors, huh? I'm sorry, Hawk, but I can't just run away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I have to protect the peace of the desert. If I run away now, that's just, you know...negligent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>These aren't people you want to fight! I saw them. They destroyed the oasis in an instant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Greed Dike is involved in this somehow, too. I heard them talking about it. There's nothing we can do about something on that scale, not by ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You hear me? We can't do anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What difference does it make if an entire country's behind this?! With my power, there's no way I'll lose to them so easily! Where are they now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hawk, tell me! The desert is in danger, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>They were west of the oasis. We should still have some time, but they'll be here soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>West. Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hawk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Balt... Take care of Carla.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Hawk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Ankh! Haa...haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Hawk?! What's the rush? Is something wrong? It's rare for you to have business with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>There's no time. I'm only going to say it once, so listen carefully. You're the only one I can trust!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>There are people targeting the survivors of the Sephira, going around from village to village and oasis to oasis, destroying them! If they aren't stopped, soon the entire desert will fall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I want you to reach out to all the merchant guilds. They must come together for the sake of the desert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>So please, hurry! These people are incredibly strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'm not sure that I can get them together so quickly, Hawk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>We won't stand a chance unless every fighter in the desert faces them together! You must gather everyone who can fight! I'm counting on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Wait! Hawk, what are you going to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I'm going to the court. I'm going to ask them for reinforcements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>What?! That's ridiculous! You've renounced your claim to nobility! The court will never accept such a request from you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Each community protects itself. That's the unspoken rule of the desert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>The notion of everyone protecting the desert together would never even occur to them. I'm not sure they'd even take a moment to consider it! It's much more likely that they would simply ignore you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You'll never know unless you try! I know that deep down inside the people of this desert are hoping for a peaceful home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>That's why I've been trying to restore the desert. I believe that my work is the beginning of a movement toward that future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>So I have to do everything I can! The desert will never change unless there is someone willing to take that first step!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>B-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You fool! How dare you set foot in this court after throwing away your status as a member of the nobility?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Our verdict is unchanged. If we offer up the remnants of the Sephira, then this will all be resolved. I see no problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I've told you over and over, that's only a temporary solution! If we keep relying on such measures, the desert will be destroyed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Enough! How dare you come here and criticize our way of doing things after forsaking us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>You should be ashamed of yourself for being so fickle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Please, wait! Hawk, are you telling the truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Of course. That's why I swallowed my pride and came back here. Please... You have to help us! This isn't about nobility or guilds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>It's bigger than all of that! Everyone in the desert is in danger! That's why you must—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I will say only this. When we feel that we are in danger, we will offer up the remnants of the Sephira as we have been asked. That is all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>What do you intend to do, Hawk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I'm going to do everything I can to protect the desert. That has not changed, and will not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Even if it's just those who support you, Nefertiti, you must have them come to our aid! I'm counting on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Carla!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>There was no sign of anyone in the west, so we turned back halfway. Hawk, you lied to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Haaa...haaa... Where are those troublemakers?! Hey, you! Have you seen anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>M-me? I'm not sure. Have there been any troublemakers, Lucian?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>No. We've passed through several oases and villages on our way here, but we haven't seen or heard of anyone like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Are you sure someone isn't playing a trick on you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>No, that can't... Wait, don't tell me you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Why would you lie?! Aren't you the one who wanted to protect the desert?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>It was for that express purpose that I lied.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>You told me to figure out what it means to protect the desert on my own, right? Well, I have my answer! I'm going to fight, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>So where are they?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I told you, these aren't people you want to fight! You don't have a chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>If they're that strong, then that's all the more reason that I should fight! With Balt there to help me, I won't lose so easily!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>You need to run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>What are you saying? This is where you planted the seeds for the crops you care about so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>We need to protect them, don't we? Or are you such a coward that you'll let them go so easily?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Crops can be planted again, but a human's life is not so easily replaced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I don't care what you say about me. All that's important to me is that you survive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I thought you wanted to protect the desert. Or was that a lie, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Carla, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I can't believe it. I looked up to you, but it turns out you're nothing but a coward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Hahah... That's right. I am a coward. Run away so you live to fight another day. It's a smart way to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>So long as you're alive, things will be all right. That's why, even if you stay, Carla, I'm leaving. I don't care if I'm the only one running away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Hawk?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Are you serious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I am. I have absolutely no intention of losing my life because of your stubbornness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Hawk! F-fine! I don't care where you go! Just leave already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Haha... I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Hawk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Leave him! Who cares what happens to a spineless guy like him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>I...believed in him. I...really...liked him. So why...? Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Wait here. I'll be back!</td>
</tr>
