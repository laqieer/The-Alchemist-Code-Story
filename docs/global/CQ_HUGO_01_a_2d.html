<td>Hey... What the?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You! Why are you here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Tch. The sight's out of alignment... That gunsmith did a shoddy job. I guess I can just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Quit messing with your gun! I'm asking you why you're—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Whoa! Wh-what are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh? What do you want? You better clear out of my shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You mercenary scum! How dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Vivi! Why should we stop?! This guy shot one of our comrades!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That was my job, okay? I mean, I did shoot him in the leg instead of his head, though, just for the sake of being from the same country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>How dare you...?! The man you shot was a loyal comrade of Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Enough! He's with us on this job, and that's final!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This man?! You have to be kidding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We don't need a feeble gunman like him on our team!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Stop! He's more than capable of—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>—beating you...without his gun. Ugh,. Here we go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What's with that hand? What are you gonna do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hmph. Nothing. I'm done here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You know, if you're gonna reach out to help someone up, you shouldn't make such an angry face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wait, where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Home. I'm clearly not wanted here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Don't say that! That's not allowed! Don't you want your payment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I... Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>See? You need to get paid somehow! Now, come on, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Jeez... So desperate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>So, we believe some rebels conspiring to start an uprising have been gathering in that hideout there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh. Come to think of it, craftsmen from Slothstein have mentioned that some of their products were being shipped there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I knew it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I see snipers hiding here and there. There's no doubt about this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Okay, Hugo, you take out those snipers and keep watch here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The rest of you, secure an escape route for me while I go blow up their weapons stockpile!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Sounds easy enough. Let's get this over with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>H-hold on a moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The higher ups only ordered us to infiltrate the enemy and seek out information for future missions! What's all this about blowing things up?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We can negate the need for future missions if we completely debilitate them here, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Right. Bust them up good now, and it's over. Let's go, Vivi, and don't you forget about my payment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm glad you're on my side in this, Hugo. Come on, guys! Don't fall behind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Aw, crap! They're really just charging in! Fine, let's go. We can't leave this to those two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>They should really re-think how they explain missions to Vivi.</td>
