<td>Oh.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Where...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So dark... Why are we here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Damn it all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Why did it turn out like this?! My theory was perfect! There might've been corruption, but there was also magil in abundance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The conditions for returning to the time of creation should have been fulfilled! So why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wait... Perhaps...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Did that girl hide this reality from me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If this phenomenon was the result of my spell working correctly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Then, is the start I was aiming for, the start of all our tragedy, outside of the Cosmic Egg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Damn it! Then it's impossible. I can't reach it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Which means that in order to return the world to its original form, I have to destroy the laws of those gods first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That voice... Quence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...Tsk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So I'm not the only idiot who's fallen into this trap?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>"Commence Space-Time Manipulation and Spatial Identification."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh? Eeeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Where are we?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The Shell of the World.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Outside the survival zone of the regions—the omnipresent will of the gods, the foundation of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This world...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes. This is the place I dreamed of! Which means...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You are that man's... You are Nimul's sister. The Vessel of Purification, the sacrifice of prosperity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You are a neuter flower only grown to protect the Gula Belt and then wither away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No need to be so guarded. I have no intention of doing anything to you as I am now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, I cannot save you either. Not that you would have wanted that from me anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...Did you fail?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Could you not directly strike at the heart of the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Regardless, yes, you are indeed correct. After all the sacrifices I made, and after becoming a hapless villain, this is the result I have achieved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Laugh at me if you like. I cannot help but laugh, myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Honestly... I've lost my way back once again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You failed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>How many times are you going to say it? Are you trying to make me cry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Then, shouldn't you try another way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huh? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Lend me some of your power, Quence. For our journey, our goal...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>For our ideal of saving all of the regions from sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Are you serious? I belong to the Infinite Serpent, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I'm an ally of Zafeiris, the one who played havoc with the Gula Belt Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I am aware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I am the man who took the life of the Queen of the Ire Belt with whom reconciliation may have been possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That may be true, but we need all the friends we can get right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Besides, you killed Teres because she wanted to die in the first place, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I was sure she had not said a word about it to any of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes, but I understood her. I was the same way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Wanting to sacrifice myself to protect those important to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'm sure she felt the same. Or am I wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What an awfully kind thing to say. Going to provide me with a way out of this, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Or do you truly believe in the goodness of humanity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What exactly have you seen until now? The magil Cursed Beasts control is the sin we humans produce!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That is the true nature of humans. Self-centered and egotistical. It's our innate instinct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The world you dream of doesn't exist anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>That's why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We have to create it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>A world where everyone spends their days smiling, a system where no one gets hurt. Even if I have to sacrifice myself, we will make it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>For your brother, who will live on even after you die?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yes, that's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>This body has always been for that purpose. To take in all the corruption of this world and provide all humankind with the blessing of purification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Nimul will surely build a better world on top of my sacrifice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>That is my hope. My wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You feel the same, do you not, Quence? You dream of a future for Ambrosia after you are gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Did Teres not choose you for an accomplice because you foresaw the same thing as she did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I admit I am surprised. I was the one who tried to recruit you in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>There's a limit to how fearless one should be, trying to convince me to leave the Infinite Serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I thought you were just the target of Nimul's protective instincts, just a princess to be sheltered. But it seems that was a facade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>And now the truth comes out. Your wish. Not ours. Yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Whatever, I'll take the bait. Do tell me what you think is the best way to save this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You have to keep it a secret from Nimul, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Urgh! Just what you'd expect of a Cursed Beast! With it being this slothful, getting a hit on it should be—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Aaaaghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Hold the line! We are the soldiers Lord Kubera has entrusted with protecting the town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Even if our bodies are broken, what lies before us is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Aaarrrggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>How disgraceful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I am a Cursed Beast—an immortal, impure curse that invades this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I am a calamity that all who live despise. A virulent poison that causes all ambition to fester.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>And yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>The time of glory is at hand! If even a small part of the power we have trained up reaches it, Lord Kubera will certainly—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Why do you not flee? Fearing death is the instinct of all living organisms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Why do you fight? Those who have fought before you have shown you that you are no match for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Unpleasant. Incomprehensible. You are all much too broken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Therefore, you must be destroyed. You must be devastated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>We have no need for such heresy in our divine world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>The town is being attack by the Cursed Beast?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>So it seems. My main troop is gathered here for the the dragon hunt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>If Mammon is so inclined, it will keep it up until sundown, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Now is not the time to be calmly dissecting things! We must hurry and aid them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>We have something else that we must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>What will returning to town accomplish? Saving townspeople? Or will you use the power you displayed before to slay the Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>That's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Cursed Beasts are beings that you cannot defeat with pure strength alone. Even I have already acknowledged this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>That is why I desire gear made from dragons, a power that can surpass the Beasts' strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Is this not the same for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>You are correct that we have no Gear of Judgement here, nor someone capable of wielding it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>And no matter how much of the Cursed Beasts' power Nimul may obtain, we do not have the resources needed to fully purify Mammon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Nevertheless, we cannot use that as a reason for allowing the people of this region to be slaughtered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>That way of thinking itself is a mistake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Our people are currently remaining in town to battle the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>Those are clearly not people who are afraid of dying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>They are fighting with everything they have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Yet they cannot defeat this Cursed Beast. You know this, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>They are buying time. Just as the phrase suggests, they are paying for it—with their lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>What we must do now is not waste their fleeting defiance and fragile blades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Blacksmith Yna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Forge the Gear of Judgement with the aid of your master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>There is little time. Complete it by sundown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>But who will wield it when it's done?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>You?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Am I inadequate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Not at all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Then it is settled. Will you go along with this plan as well, Roh Ku?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Heh. I have no objections. I am a little interested in the skill my apprentice has miraculously gained overnight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Master, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>There is no need to explain, Yna. We are blacksmiths who seek the truth hidden within iron and fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>To me, you have become worthy of inheriting my name. That is enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I understand, Master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Sorry, Nimul, but I will make that gear after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Yna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>It looks like the young blacksmith has decided. What will you do, traveler?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>You said that the townspeople are buying us time by fighting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Most likely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Then I...we...should launch the airship and head towards town to help buy that time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>We have always fought to save as many people as we can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>I have no intention of deviating from that path now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>My people do not fear death or pain. What we hate is the shame of not fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>And yet I should ignore our ambitions to save them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>The power to do so is in our hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>I will needlessly save them even if they do not wish us to. To achieve the future you envision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>So...that is the secret of your power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I am amazed that you can hold so much greed within your thin frame... I've taken a liking to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>I will concede that that is also a strength. I shall not stop you. And my soldiers will not stop you either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Show me what you can do until I receive the gear the blacksmiths make and can return to the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Of course, that's what I intend to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Sorry, Nimul. I'm counting on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Right. And I you, for the Gear of Judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>I apologize for dragging you all into this when you came all this way to save us, but right now—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>We understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>You want to save this region just like you did ours, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Then I have to help you out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>It's the perfect time to pay you back for everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>I suppose I'll help as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>A witch who can control magic with her bare hands is very valuable now that we have no Gears of Judgment, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Very much so, Ambrosia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>And you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Do you detest me, Pursuer of Gluttony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>I do have much to say to you, and sins I want you to atone for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>But we don't have the time for such things now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>I don't know what your intentions are, but if you truly want to be an ally as you say, I'll be certain to make full use of you, Zafeiris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Very well then. This body that has mastered the dragon technique...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>I will use it for your purposes this one time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>That is well and good, but won't it be I that is doing all the work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Of course. I currently have no body of my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>In order to manifest my power in this world, I need a catalyst.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>That is good enough. Although, I am still unsure of my control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>I am containing the corruption. You may use my powers to your hearts content.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Huh? Waginau, how did you find yourself in such an interes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>A difficult...situation? Is it fusion? Coalescence? Are there any side effects?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Your true priorities escaped you for a moment, didn't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>No, not at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Truthfully, I have a lot of concerns, but for now, let's focus on what we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Minario, set the airship's course for the Avaritia Belt's city center!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Roger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Let's get this show on the road! I'm not as responsible a driver as Adaleigh, so hold on or you'll go flying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>There they go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>In order to save people. A reason that we do not value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Power always comes to those who have a reason for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>I shall never let all the blood spilled here be for naught!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>E-excuse me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Skree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Young blacksmith Yna's sister, aren't you? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Um, I... I'm always being helped by others! Which is why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>You want to be of help but do not know how.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Yes. That's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>If that is the case, you should have gone with the travelers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>That's... But I'm weak and my brother would have stopped me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Yes, I can see that you are weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>If you have the will to fight, you should fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>The word "helpless" is the conceit of the weak. At least, in this region it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>W-well, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Listen well, girl. Avaritian soldiers do not start off strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>There were times when they too were shielded and protected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Even you, Lord Kubera?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Indeed. However, I desired power, the determination to battle things stronger than myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>That is the way of life we've carved out for ourselves here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Fighting, growing stronger, overcoming. We take control of hardships and despair through power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Our predecessors understood that there are things that we could not protect without doing this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Greed is the true nature of man. If so, if we want for things from the moment we are born...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>We must face it. We must fight against it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>So what will you do? What will you spend your life on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>I...will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Skrah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Eeek! The F-Fallen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>But they seem different from the ones like me, back in town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>This may be an effect of Mammon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>They are nothing but mindless automatons born from the miasma of the Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>They are beings different to those of us who fall to sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Grroogh...want...want...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>Skree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>Th-thank you, Luke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>The miniature dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>After fighting that traveler, you have learned how to control the corruption?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>And now you use it to protect her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>Skree skree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>What an interesting bond. Is this the reshaped future that boy Nimul desires?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>Th-they're coming this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>They are nothing but wraiths that lack the will to fight and yet still contain want. What a pitiful existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>Fall back. These will take one swipe of my hardened blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>Huh? Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>I-I'm! I'm also from here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>I will do my best, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>Skree skree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>I have no interest in protecting the weak. If you are prepared to die, then follow me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
