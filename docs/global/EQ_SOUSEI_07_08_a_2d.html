<td>The word "helpless" is the conceit of the weak. At least, in this region it is.</td>

<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>W-well, um...</td>

<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Listen well, girl. Avaritian soldiers do not start off strong.</td>

<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>There were times when they too were shielded and protected.</td>

<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>Even you, Lord Kubera?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Indeed. However, I desired power, the determination to battle things stronger than myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>That is the way of life we've carved out for ourselves here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Fighting, growing stronger, overcoming. We take control of hardships and despair through power!</td>

<td>Our predecessors understood that there are things that we could not protect without doing this.</td>

<td>Greed is the true nature of man. If so, if we want for things from the moment we are born...</td>

<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>We must face it. We must fight against it.</td>

<td>So what will you do? What will you spend your life on?</td>

<td>Skrah!</td>

<td>Eeek! The F-Fallen?</td>

<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>But they seem different from the ones like me, back in town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>This may be an effect of Mammon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>They are nothing but mindless automatons born from the miasma of the Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>They are beings different to those of us who fall to sin.</td>

<tr>

<td>After fighting that traveler, you have learned how to control the corruption?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>And now you use it to protect her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Luke</td>
<td>Skree skree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>What an interesting bond. Is this the reshaped future that boy Nimul desires?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>Th-they're coming this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>They are nothing but wraiths that lack the will to fight and yet still contain want. What a pitiful existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Fall back. These will take one swipe of my hardened blade.</td>

<td>No!</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>I will do my best, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Luke</td>
<td>Skree skree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>I have no interest in protecting the weak. If you are prepared to die, then follow me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
