<td>001</td>
<td>Nice! I didn't think you'd be so powerful, Miss! I mean, you look so lovely and genteel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You...are not afraid of me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What? Why would I be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You’re awesome! You can do stuff no one else can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You were so glorious while you were fighting—like something legendary! Like a mermaid or something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmhm. You're an interesting one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Thank you for warning me of the danger. Now, if you will excuse me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Erm... Why are you following me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh? What kind of question is that? A disciple should always follow their mistress! Duh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm Milis, by the way! Looking forward to learning from you! Uh, what was your name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Disciple...? My name is Tethys, but I certainly have no need for a disciple! In fact, it would be rather more of a burden. Why on earth do you want to be my disciple?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I wanna be a lady, just like you! Miss Tethys, you've got a, uh... A kind of gracefulness! I want to learn how to be like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, I'm sure there are many other people out there who could teach you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No way! It has to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh... Heheh! I didn't get to eat my food, so now I'm super hungry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Your food? Are you talking about that monster? You were going to...eat it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Of course! It's delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I apologize. I dropped it into the ocean without even consulting you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No, no, it's fine! You didn't do anything wrong, Miss Tethys! I should have said something earlier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Eheheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Of course! I shall treat you to a meal! It is the least I can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Afterwards, I truly hope that you will have reconsidered all of this disciple nonsense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Food?! You're going to treat me to food?! Yesss! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Did you even hear me? I was saying some other rather important⁠—wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Look at all these restaurants with such delicious looking food! Are there any places that make dishes with water lizards? No? Oh! Meat! I want meat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I-I'm...uncomfortable in such a crowded, dirty place. Why don't we go to one of my favorite restaurants?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Look at that sign! It's got a huge picture of meat on it! It's gotta be good! Let's go there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What? O-oh, well... I-if you insist...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(I suppose since I'm treating her, it would be quite rude of me to insist going elsewhere. Hopefully she will be satisfied with this and then I can go straight home. Alone!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh, dear. Perhaps it would have been better to go to the restaurant I suggested. Nothing here looks...sanitary. I am not sure that it’s safe for me to touch anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Tethys, aren’t you gonna order anything? This is really yummy! Try it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Erm... No, thank you. I am very grateful for the offer, but I must refuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well, well! Do my eyes deceive me, or is that the lady of the sea herself? I've only seen you from far away during ceremonies ‘til now, but you're quite pretty up close, eh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Heh, get over here and pour us a drink, Miss Mermaid! Let's share a drink together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What's with that attitude? You ignoring me? You think you're better than me, monster girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Urk! Please, stop this! Let go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hey! Stop that! How dare you lay your hands on Miss Tethys! Monster?! You clearly don't know anything about how to treat a lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh? And who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I’m Milis, and I’m Miss Tethys' disciple! If you wanna mess with her, you’re gonna have to go through me first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hah! Fine, then! Let's see you try to take me on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Milis! This is terrible! Why has it come to this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Milis! Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Tethys! You didn't have to come out! Just wait inside, I'll be back in a jiffy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I could not do such a thing! All of this is my responsibility, not yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Now you two are fighting? Ridiculous. I’m gonna sweep the floor with you, no matter how many of you there are!</td>
