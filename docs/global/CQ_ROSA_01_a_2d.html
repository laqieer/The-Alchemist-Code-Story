<td>001</td>
<td>Hmm... I still have a long way to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Do you have a minute?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I heard that I could find the "ultimate blacksmith" around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>From your appearance...would that be you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm the "ultimate blacksmith"? Did you believe the rumors? Are you an idiot?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I see. I guess I was mistaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That being said, I'll be able to tell by examining the weapon you're holding. Can you lend it to me for a second?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hmph. Do what you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It looks like an ordinary sword...but...there are overlapping layers of iron. On top of that, it's skillfully built.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmm. Not bad. Are you going to try and get away with just showing me this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I make no claim to being the "ultimate blacksmith."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Besides, what you're holding in your hand is far from anything that can be defined as "ultimate."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What do you mean? It doesn't seem that badly built.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's true that it cuts well. However, it lacks any semblance of a soul that latches onto its wielder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Do you know what I'm talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>A soul... Indeed, a soul...heheh. The primary emotion of destruction dwells within a weapon. I guess you could call that a soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Heheh. I like the way you think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It isn't that this sword lacks a soul. It's still "dead." It hasn't been blessed with a worthy wielder yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'll awaken the soul of this sword. Watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Th-the sword...broke...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well...um...about this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ah. Let's try to stay calm for now, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>He-hey...it's a hassle to dispose of defective weapons, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's why I broke it for you. In other words, you're allowed to thank me, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...Hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I-it's the soul. This sword didn't have a soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Speaking of swords with souls, you're talking about enchanted ones that can kill gods and absorb the blood of demons, right? Try making something like that next...eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I see. In that case, hurry on home. I've got nothing like that here for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh! He-hey, wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What? Is there anything else you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Although it may be broken, not many humans could forge a sword like this. Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I am no one. Just a blacksmith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Stop feigning ignorance. There's no way a run-of-the-mill blacksmith could forge a blade so sharp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What would a little wench like you know about anything? Haven't you done enough damage by breaking my sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Are you trying to imply that my observation is flawed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Isn't it? It's hard to believe anyone wielding a weapon in such flashy outfit has a good eye for anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>My appearance has nothing to do with this! Also, don't make fun of my holy garments!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Holy garments...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>This garment has been dyed with the bloody tears of a fallen angel. This is the holy garment promised to me that I alone am allowed to wear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What the...? And who promised them to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>A god.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I see. You should get checked by a doctor as soon as possible. Good luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wait. Don't you understand the sublimity of these holy garments?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No, nor do I want to. Both weapons and armor are tools to be used on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Only an idiot or someone with too much time on their hands would lavish so much time on a battle tool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wh-what did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I-I won't forgive you. You're the one who got all high-and-mighty about a soul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>How dare you make fun of me. I'll send you to the underworld where you can mull over what's happened here!</td>
