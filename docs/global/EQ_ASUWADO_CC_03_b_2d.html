<td>Huh! You aren't half bad. Guess you live up to that name of yours after all, Najam...regrettably.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Honestly, it's one thing after another these days! First there are all the negotiations, then the caravan attacks, and now you filthy lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There's a line connecting all of these things, and we have a pretty good idea what it is. But there's still something else left to piece together here that smells real fishy to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I was expecting you to come try and kill me, but...isn't this too soon? I figured I'd have to wait my turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I thought you Zalam Gaim folk were particular about doing jobs in order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That is none of your concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'll bet it's your concern, though. You lot get pretty flustered when you have to go against your code. It puts you off your game.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Your strict adherence to the rules sets you apart from other assassins' guilds. It's practically what you're all about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Seems to me like your whole system is in danger of collapse when you make an exception like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I am an assassin of Zalam Gaim. I do what is asked of me. And I don't concern myself with anything beyond that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's how it's always been, and this time is no different. There is no exception here. And nothing further to discuss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, well, then. If the so-called star of all assassins says so, what can I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Pity it won't matter much longer, since the ripple effect of this...gross misconduct will throw your whole system into chaos sooner or later. Zalam Gaim's days are numbered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But, I guess that's good for us, so I'm happy to just sit back and wait for the fall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hyaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Nnngh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hey, uh, you're kind of leaving me hanging here! I think I've stalled her as much as I possibly can. Little help, please?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Little rude, is more like it! I trekked all the way to Wratharis and back in short order to clean up this mess. You might try sounding a bit more grateful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What in the...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Listen here, Zalam Gaim puppet. You are to abandon your mission here and now. The man who ordered the hit on the Desert Wings' guild captain is dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We're talking about the attacks on the caravans of late. We looked into the matter and came across a certain noble at the heart of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Someone who wanted to see Envylia's profits dry up, and thought to make it happen by sabotaging the trade route with a roving gang of bandits...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>And for good measure, to take down the Desert Wings, too, since they've become so pivotal to trade here. Which meant contracting Zalam Gaim.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Which is why the Desert Wings made a formal request to the Sand Hawks to secure the safety of that trade route...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Entailing a little bit of search-and-destroy on the person behind the caravan attacks. Ipso facto, your contractor is deceased now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And I'm afraid that means making the star assassin of Zalam Gaim experience her greatest failure ever, by thwarting her mission to kill the guild captain of the Desert Wings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If I'm not mistaken, Zalam Gaim's creed states that should the person ordering the assassination be disposed of before the job has been carried out...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...then the mission is subsequently deemed as a failure. Is that not the case?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Did you...plan all of this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The Desert Wings claim victory over the master assassin, Najam, who has heretofore never failed to complete a mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No doubt it's only a matter of time before this information spreads. It's going to be a rather big story, I dare say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>And it will only serve to increase the public's trust in the Desert Wings even more, which in turn will bolster the market even further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You can see why we went to all the trouble to tackle this problem from basically every angle. There was simply too much to gain, for everyone, not to put our all into it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It was all rather reckless, however. We were happy to help, for the sake of ensuring safety and prosperity and all that, but we're not jumping at the chance to do anything like this ever again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Don't get me wrong! I'm glad it succeeded, and we have our tight bonds and teamwork, as well as the strong ties between our two organizations, to thank for that. But still... Never again, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Believe me, the feeling is mutual. This whole ordeal has been a headache and a half.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What I don't get is how you could put yourself in harm's way like this, knowing there was a price on your head. All to help keep some trade running smoothly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's not like I really wanted to go through all that, but it's important to always make sure you've got a safe place to let your guard down and rest your head at night, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Plus, I mean, I am technically the guild captain, so I've gotta actually take charge from time to time. Even better if I can preserve public order in the process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Not that you care about any of that, though. You take no interest in the reasons behind your assignments, because they don't concern you, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Lady Najam. What should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>If the client is dead, then we abandon the mission, as the creed dictates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But, abandoning the mission will stain your record!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>And we can't be sure that the client truly is dead. Only the intermediary even knows the client's identity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Then we'll confirm with the intermediary. Under the current circumstances, we cannot rightfully continue the mission until we do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Besides...changes to the order of our missions run counter to the creed in the first place. We may already have involved ourselves in an illegitimate job. I don't intend to drag us down any farther.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>There they go. And with that, I think the situation is a wrap. Trade should start booming again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>So, what now? There could be any number of other good-for-nothing nobles lurking around out there, plotting to do the same thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But when word gets out about Najam failing her mission, that should be enough to make them think twice about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>And since Zalam Gaim assassins are prohibited from carrying out jobs after the client has died, I think we should all be safe for the time being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Though that also means we won't have a whole lot to do for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I fail to see any problem there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Exactly. Making sure everyone's safe is what's most important. Once that's taken care of, a little downtime is never a bad thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I must say, though, that was the most I think I've ever heard you talk, Ryle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I know you had a lot on the line, and needed to buy time for Balt to show up, but I'm genuinely impressed you pulled it off, considering your usual dismissive nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It's no big deal. I just did what I felt like. Besides, now we've evened the score a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Master Ryle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Never mind.</td>
</tr>
