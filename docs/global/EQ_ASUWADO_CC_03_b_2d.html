</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ankh.png" alt="Ankh" height="128"><br>Ankh</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>

<tr>

<td>Lady Najam. What should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>
<td>If the client is dead, then we abandon the mission, as the creed dictates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>But, abandoning the mission will stain your record!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>And we can't be sure that the client truly is dead. Only the intermediary even knows the client's identity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>
<td>Then we'll confirm with the intermediary. Under the current circumstances, we cannot rightfully continue the mission until we do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>
<td>Besides...changes to the order of our missions run counter to the creed in the first place. We may already have involved ourselves in an illegitimate job. I don't intend to drag us down any farther.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>There they go. And with that, I think the situation is a wrap. Trade should start booming again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ankh.png" alt="Ankh" height="128"><br>Ankh</td>
<td>So, what now? There could be any number of other good-for-nothing nobles lurking around out there, plotting to do the same thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ankh.png" alt="Ankh" height="128"><br>Ankh</td>
<td>But when word gets out about Najam failing her mission, that should be enough to make them think twice about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ankh.png" alt="Ankh" height="128"><br>Ankh</td>
<td>And since Zalam Gaim assassins are prohibited from carrying out jobs after the client has died, I think we should all be safe for the time being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ankh.png" alt="Ankh" height="128"><br>Ankh</td>
<td>Though that also means we won't have a whole lot to do for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>I fail to see any problem there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/carl.png" alt="Carla" height="128"><br>Carla</td>
<td>Exactly. Making sure everyone's safe is what's most important. Once that's taken care of, a little downtime is never a bad thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/carl.png" alt="Carla" height="128"><br>Carla</td>
<td>I must say, though, that was the most I think I've ever heard you talk, Ryle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/carl.png" alt="Carla" height="128"><br>Carla</td>
<td>I know you had a lot on the line, and needed to buy time for Balt to show up, but I'm genuinely impressed you pulled it off, considering your usual dismissive nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>It's no big deal. I just did what I felt like. Besides, now we've evened the score a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ankh.png" alt="Ankh" height="128"><br>Ankh</td>
<td>Master Ryle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>Never mind.</td>
