<td>Captain Kudan used to often say...</td>

<td>He wanted power. He wanted the absolute power that can surpass any in the world.</td>

<td>Is that somehow related to what happened this time?</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cano.png" alt="Kanon" height="128"><br>Kanon</td>
<td>To be honest, I think it's instinct. The fact that Kagura and Lord Zain are leading and that most of the captains have gathered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cano.png" alt="Kanon" height="128"><br>Kanon</td>
<td>Seeing the situation, it's because a plan bigger than anything we've done until now is about to happen, right?</td>

<td>Use my light to neutralize the darkness.</td>

<td>Yes. Most likely. Most likely since he was born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>I don't know if it's because of that, but since he joined the Holy Guard, his talent has been increasing exponentially.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cano.png" alt="Kanon" height="128"><br>Kanon</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>Because of the considerable fanfare he received regarding his talent when he joined, it seems like Lord Zain and Captain Cadanova had their eyes on him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>Then...after being the target of everyone's expectations, in order to obtain more knowledge and experience and to strengthen his abilities, he decided to study abroad.</td>

<td>Study abroad? Are you talking about that fateful day...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>Yes, that fateful time. One of the countries he visited during his studies, he ended up watching fall before his very eyes.</td>

<td>Greed Dike's attack on Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>Yes. He stood in front of the unexperienced Wadatsumi fighters and fought as effectively as he could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cano.png" alt="Kanon" height="128"><br>Kanon</td>
<td>But...the only one to survive was Captain Kudan along with Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yes. Try to imagine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>A 15-year-old fresh knight, he sees all his allies massacred in front of his eyes as he stands there. It truly must have been hell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>In Kudan's head, that image is being played over and over again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>The dangerous signs in his behavior began around that time as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cano.png" alt="Kanon" height="128"><br>Kanon</td>
<td>So are you saying that the tragedy he witnessed awoke the darkness within Captain Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>Most likely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>Thanks to that trauma, what was already lying dormant with him rushed forward to the front, causing the power of darkness to awaken with him. That's the most likely explanation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>Apparently, Lord Zain and Captain Cadanova long troubled over how to help Kudan recover.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>In the end...Captain Cadanova accepted him into the 4th Regiment and showed him the road to light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>That man tried to dispel the source of darkness from within him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>However, for some reason, there were many incidences regarding forces of darkness occurring around him...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>His studies and the effect that the power of darkness had on him increased steadily...until finally that incident that you were here to witness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cano.png" alt="Kanon" height="128"><br>Kanon</td>
<td>Where Captain Cadanova died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>That man tried to rescue Kudan with only his own strength. Perhaps he sensed something similar to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>In comparison to Lord Zain, Captain Cadanova's light was not all that bright, and he would sometimes wield the power of darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cano.png" alt="Kanon" height="128"><br>Kanon</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>In contrast to the two of them was Lord Zain...he was steadfast in his justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cano.png" alt="Kanon" height="128"><br>Kanon</td>
<td>I see. That's why Chihaya told me about Captain Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>Probably. However, ironically, Chihaya, who gave Kudan advice, was ultimately assassinated. Causing a further negative effect on Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>His inability for not having been able to stop her assassination fed his desire for more power. Ultimately, unleashing what was inside him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>He himself seems to be trying his best to suppress it, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>It's too dangerous to let Kudan in his current state touch the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cano.png" alt="Kanon" height="128"><br>Kanon</td>
<td>There's a possibility that it will cause Captain Kudan to lose balance within himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>Yes. The reason why Lord Zain removed Kudan from this task was all for his own sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cano.png" alt="Kanon" height="128"><br>Kanon</td>
<td>Worded different, you mean that a darkness that big exists within Wadatsumi right now, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suzu.png" alt="Suzuka" height="128"><br>Suzuka</td>
<td>I'm sorry to bother you while you're engaged, but we're almost out of the forest. After that, once we cut through the plains, we'll be at the rendezvous point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yaul.png" alt="Yauras" height="128"><br>Yauras</td>
<td>Oh, the monsters are here to welcome us. Everyone, get into fighting positions. Hurry!</td>
