<td>002</td>
<td>Why did they have to fight back? They messed up the cacao! Even Mr. Lamp is angry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, at least we caught them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We'll go and hand these thieves over to the authorities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We'll be back soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Okay! Well, that's a relief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hmph. See? You humans are despicable, thieving off of each other like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You should all reflect upon yourselves and your own deeds before judging demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>How dare you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I am born of a house of proud warriors. How dare you speak of me as if I am as lowly as those thieves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Whatever. Warrior or thief, you're all just humans to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What's your problem?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This is not good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>They're getting more hostile by the minute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Noah, go and get the cacao from the warehouse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Okay, that's the cacao taken care of. Now to just... Hey! Suzuka! Itsuki! Both of you, calm down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Being born of a house of warriors is my greatest honor! How can I stay calm when she berates my honor so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What are you so proud of? Once you've left your home country, the only difference between Wadatsumi warriors and the rest of you humans is that you have a different name for your swords.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>How dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>People from Wadatsumi are all the same! You're nothing but a bunch of narrow-minded fools, bound hand and foot by your insignificant traditions and biases!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I've never been gladder than after the destruction of Wadatsumi! I've never been so free!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Suzuka! Please calm down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Let go of me, Eve! I cannot forgive her! How dare she speak of my home and countrymen like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That was pretty harsh, Itsuki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That's easy for you to say. You've never been persecuted by Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Eve! I brought the Orange Cacao! But, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>M-monsters?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, as you can see, I attracted some unwanted attention. Help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Noah! There's some Purple Cacao mixed in with the orange!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, right. We hadn't gotten around to sorting the cacao by color yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I... I just grabbed the big box, and... And...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Noah, calm down! Here, take this silver spoon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I... I feel much better now. Thank you, Emma. Now, let's take care of these monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh! Suzuka, Itsuki! Monsters are headed your way! Sorry about that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Wait here, Itsuki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>As a samurai, I must fulfill my duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You don't think I can handle it? This is my job, too, you know!</td>
