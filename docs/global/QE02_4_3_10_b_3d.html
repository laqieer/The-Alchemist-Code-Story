<td>Uck... What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It’s over. Now die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Here it comes...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What? Ek...! Ekk...!!! Agh... Wh-what is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Agh... Wh-what’s happening? What’s going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Pretty effective, isn’t it? It’s 20-years worth of that idiot’s will-power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>His stupid effort wasn’t for nothing after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ekk! Ekkk...! Wh-what are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You draw in energy from all around you, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The amount is already disproportionate to your small body. Just imagine what would happen if you took absorbed the frightening amount of power he’s built up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>No... I-it can’t be...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It’s called overheating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It must make no sense to you machines who hate inefficiency.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You never actually thought there’d be an idiot who would store 20-years worth of energy, did you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Don’t you see? What he did in those 20 years of his life that you would think went to waste...is something that no machine could ever copy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wa-wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We humans can’t be measured by algorisms and numbers. That’s why you’ve lost to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Agh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>H-how dare you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Belphegor! ...Edgar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We...were so close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We’re out of time. We won’t make it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>There’s 1 minute...left...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No matter how fast we gas it on the bike, it’s too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, it can’t be helped. We did what we could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmph. That’s why you’re an idiot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Have you forgotten your profession? If you shoot it down, you can still make it...oww...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You’re the idiot. It’s pointless to just shoot it down. We have to place it on the pedestal that’s behind the clock dial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>When you say pedestal...do you mean where they’re pointing to now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Edgar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Little lady...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>A-aim for the center of the clock dial! The pedestal is behind that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Please, Edgar! Use your gun to hit the dial and set the clock of this country’s history into motion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You gotta be kidding me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Tsk. Well, I can’t afford to make the little lady cry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Are you saying that the fate of this world rests on my talent as a gunslinger? What a hassle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Are you seriously gonna try to hit it from this distance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>There’s no way he’ll miss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hmph. When push comes to shove...he always delivers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Tsk. Honestly, he’s a real show stealer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Jeez. Don’t blame me if this doesn’t work out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Father...lend me your power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Let the dial that races towards destruction stop...let the historic dial of the Slothstein move once more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huwahhhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Th-the pillar of light...! The light has returned to the clock tower!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The tremors have stopped!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...?! Get down, young miss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Wh-what is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Wh-what’s that light?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It’s the light of the sun...are the thick clouds beginning to dissipate?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Edgar and the others succeeded! We got back the Sacred Stone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yeahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Young miss...no...perhaps I should call you madam?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You have become a mistress worthy of the House of Elester.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>After all, you were able to bring back this beautiful country...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...with its blue sky and blooming flowers, something even your father Mayor Edward couldn’t do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Most likely this is the scenario that your old man was pursuing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Edgar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>This light was achieved at the hands of humans who fought and struggled for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I’m sure it’ll reach the hearts of those lethargic citizens who have long given up hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Your father never gave up on the power of humanity, even until the very end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I’m sure this is the ideal scenario he had pictured in his mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>How about it? Were you able to discover your old man’s true intentions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Hey, hold on. Are you sure it’s okay? The young lady and the others were looking for you, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It’s fine. Words of farewell will only stop the natural flow of the wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>The wind...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You wouldn’t understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>That being said, people really change, don’t they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>The people of Slothstein, who were called lethargic, are now sweating their way to restoring their country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>It’s hard to believe a chump like you could achieve such a great accomplishment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>All I did was return my debt to the old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Well then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Where are you headed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Who knows? I surrender to the flow of the wind. Where are you headed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I must search for the art to resurrect Belphegor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Hey...just so we’re clear, the reason that thing is just a pebble now is because it reached the end of its lifespan. It wasn’t because I shot it down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You’ve told me that countless times. I’m not blaming you, am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Belphegor used up the last of its Alchemic energy in order to thwart that fortress in the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Most likely, the effect will last for a few years, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Are you saying that if Belphegor’s Alchemic energy weakens...the island will start moving again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Hold on. You gotta be kidding me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>That’s why it’s important to do whatever is possible to resurrect this thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I don’t have time. If possible, I’d like to leave this role to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Having witnessed your power, I am asking you to lend me your strength—to work together with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Heh. If you’re trying to recruit volunteers, I’d suggest you look elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I’m not the type to become a justice warrior. I don’t like belonging to a herd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Hey, hold on...let's at least talk about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You...! You women repellent! Give me back my 20 years!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Tsk! Get on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>W-wait! I haven’t finished...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Seriously, you dunce...do I really have to spell it out for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I said you’re a dunce. We’ve been comrades since the moment we fought and overcame death together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Edgar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Search for the laws of this world...that’s what the wind is telling me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>You don’t have to tell me that resurrecting Belphegor is my job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I don’t really know if I’m using this right...but is this when I’m supposed to say it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Say what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>You moved me...Edgar L. Leonhart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I’ve found you, you scum!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>The natural disaster in my life turned out to be you! I’ll finish you here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Hyper Galactic Tornado Spiral Illusion...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Tsk! Holds on tight! I’m gonna step on it! Where should I head?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Ack... T-to Lustburg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Lustburg...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Wh-why are you stopping?! He’s gaining on us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>You’re talking about that country people call paradise...where men are forbidden, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Ye-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Since Lustburg excels in magic, we may be able to resurrect Belphegor...he’s coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Hah! Looks like fortune is finally blowing my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Wh-whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Tsk! Don’t let them escape, Tango!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Sorry, massive arm! My dream-like paradise is waiting for me...see ya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>This is a nightmare. I have to be dreaming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>This is all just a dream. There’s no way a hell like this actually exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>So you’re the intruder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>You’ve got some nerve sneaking into our country! Men are forbidden here! Bring him here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Eeeek!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Gi-gi-girls are...scary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Aghh...!</td>
