<td>Huff...huff...! W-we finally arrived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>There's nothing here after all! We came all the way for this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wait, there's too little here. What's going on with this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's true. I don't understand it! There's nothing here that can be seen as a power source!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A power source! You're right... How was this clock moving before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Look! There's a pedestal here too! It looks similar to the one we saw underground!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Two Sacred Stone pedestals? But, this country only has one Sacred Stone Belphegor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Tsk. I don't get it. Does it mean that these aren't even for Sacred Stones at all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No need to understand it, hon. Any guess you make now will be short lived anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Jeez. You're fast. You showed up before we even sensed your presence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I've never seen this model before! Aye, most likely, it's the newest model after the AJ2500 that we saw on the ground outside of Don Taras's mansion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>AJ2500? Really, little guy? I'd prefer if you didn't compare me to that outdated crap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm the AJ3000, an Alkaroid developed as the protector of the clock tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So this feisty one right here was appointed as a replacement for Ethan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Tsk. Not good. I doubt I can win this battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wh-why?! It's not like you to give up even before you fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's not what this is about. I won't fight against a woman. I've decided that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's unfortunate, hon. Well then, how about you keep not fighting while I send you into the next life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You've blocked my sword. Not bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>St-stop... This kind of action isn't very ladylike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You still seem to have plenty of fight in you. I don't like men who aren't straight forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You're a bit of a pain, so I'll start off in battle mode if you don't mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Alchemic energy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh?! I-it disappeared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Agh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Edgar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ugh! Cough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well then, hon, let's begin! Entertain me with your pistols!</td>
