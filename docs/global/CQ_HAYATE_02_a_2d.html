<td>Yay, we defeated it somehow!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(I was slow on the draw and my technique was off... I'm trying to become a man that can protect Rin and yet...!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hayate! You're not hurt, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, uh, I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Rin, are you okay? You fell earlier and all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm fine! Totally fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I see. That's good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, I don't see that baby Ratty anymore. I'm going to go find it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, there you are! Don't just go off on you own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You're hurt, aren't you? Let's get you back to Rin and have her patch you up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Nu! Numa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hm? What's that... Aaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ow ow ouch... Who'd have thought there'd be a hole here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hayate! Are you okay?! I'll be right down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh, and you found the little tyke! That's great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>First, let's get this little one patched up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And done! Now how about you, Hayate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Oh Hayate, you're hurt, too! Your face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh!</td>

<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(Again...)</td>

<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This is just a flesh wound. I'm fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh no no! My friend said that if you leave that kind of wound untreated, it'll grow worse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I fall a lot, so I also wind up with those kinds of wounds and my friend always treats it for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>When I first met you, I used the methods she taught me to take care of your wounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>When we first met?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Thank you. You're amazing. Being able to remove traps by yourself and even giving first-aid...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Really? Hehehe, thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So that's where you learned it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>At that time, I was glad that I had learned it from my friend. I was able to help you with it, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You said that relying on someone else makes you weak, but having someone that'll help you is a great thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Sorry, maybe I'm just being a busybody...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>N-no, that's notâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You treated that baby Ratty and all... Hey, it ran off again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What?! But it shouldn't be up and about yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Little ooone! Where'd you gooo?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, there you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
