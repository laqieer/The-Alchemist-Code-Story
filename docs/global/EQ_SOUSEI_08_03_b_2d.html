<td>Matter! Give me more strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That won't be enough.</td>

<td>Hrk! Haa...</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The Cursed Beasts are comprised of all the sins borne by their regions' people, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Tch! Cursed is right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ulgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Quence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Keep a close eye on it! It's coming back for more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wha— Aaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Emmel, was it? Arrogant of you to believe you would be able to bear all of this on your own, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I don't...care! I'm not...giving...up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(Why is it looking at me again?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hmm. I guess the fight is over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wait, what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It doesn't seem like Lucifer wants to continue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>He probably thinks it a shame to have you die here. And I feel the same, frankly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You're a surprisingly delightful human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What are you planning to do with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Why, treat you as a proper guest and entertain you, of course. Just give me a moment to make the preparations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes, Sir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Prepare a room for our special guest, and another for our prodigal son. And make sure to have the finest meals at the ready for each, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes, Sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You should rest now, young lady. I'm excited to see what you will decide to do next—if you'll deign to challenge me again, or finally give up this foolish pursuit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>How...dare you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>And, just like that, the girl who had swept into our home like a storm took a knee before Father's might.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>She looked absolutely pitiful, her body mottled with wounds. And yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>A stalwart determination remained in her eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What a mess this all turned out to be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Nonetheless, we should treat their injuries. Can you take care of Quence, Ignacio?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Well... If that is your wish. But, do you really think it wise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I... I mean... They just tried to usurp us. They're the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>True. But Father called them guests, so we should treat them as such.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Even if we don't exactly want to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I...suppose that's a fair point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Though I'd suggest we take care of it quickly. It would be best if our guests did not overstay their welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That girl...is trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I must say, I'm surprised. It's rare for you to doubt Father's judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You think so? Perhaps I'm just a bit on edge. Things did happen rather suddenly this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If that is the case, however, then...well, I am a bit ashamed of myself for allowing my emotions to get the better of me. Sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What is it? You know you may always speak freely with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh, it's nothing. I was just thinking about how much more...endearing you used to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh. Well... That's probably because humans mature quickly, unlike your kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Not helping! When you say things like that, you endear yourself to absolutely no one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hahaha! Duly noted. If you'll excuse me, then, I'll go see to Quence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Saving everything, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It's a nice thought. If only it were possible...</td>
