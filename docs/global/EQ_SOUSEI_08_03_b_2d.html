<tr>

<td>You think so? Perhaps I'm just a bit on edge. Things did happen rather suddenly this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>If that is the case, however, then...well, I am a bit ashamed of myself for allowing my emotions to get the better of me. Sorry.</td>

<td>Oh. Well... That's probably because humans mature quickly, unlike your kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hahaha! Duly noted. If you'll excuse me, then, I'll go see to Quence.</td>
