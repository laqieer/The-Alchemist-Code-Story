<td>I can't believe I messed up like that. I ended up being a burden to another squadron...to Captain Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Seriously... I'm such an idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Sigh... I'll go back to my room and reflect on my actions.</td>

<td>Chloe!</td>

<td>Captain Vettel?! I-I'm sorry about today!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Are you feeling bad about what happened?</td>

<td>Ye-yes...</td>

<td>Chloe...did anyone from the Crown's Guard lose their life today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What?! N-no...but some suffered minor casualties...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Then, that's fine.</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>As someone who leads a squadron, your aim is to return safely with all your knights alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You accomplished that, Chloe. So you can stop worrying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But if I'd assessed the situation earlier, no one would've even gotten hurt.</td>

<tr>

<td>Huh?</td>

<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Come on. Give me 50 swings!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh, um...yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>One! Two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Why does Captain Vettel want me to practice my swings? Is it because I'm weak?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...On your mark!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But somehow I feel calm like I used to when I would swing my sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>All right. Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>How about it? Do you feel refreshed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wow... Yes! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>U-um... Swinging my blade like I used to helped me to calm down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I feel so embarrassed that I lost myself like that. I'm sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Chloe, raise your head. I just told you that there's no need to apologize, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh, that's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Raise your head. This is a present for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Captain Vettel, it's time for your meeting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ah. Well, I have to go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, I'm sorry! Thank you for taking your time</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I'm happy that you became commander of the Crown's Guard, Chloe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Consider this my present to your appointment as commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh, um...well...thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh...it is a gift? I wonder what...it is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Wow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's beautiful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...Sniff.</td>
