<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Most likely within Mikaboshi's consciousness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Most likely?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>W-well... Probably. Yeah... Yeah, I think so! Maybe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, hello.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Nice to meet you, descendant of the Rising Ashes. I am Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're the one I saw before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Thank you again, Amane. It's only through your actions that I was able to reunite with my body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Now that I'm able to invite Logi into my consciousness with you, we've come one step closer to Kagutsuchi. It pleases me so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Didn't we talk about that forced formality once before? We're all friends here. You don't need to speak so stiffly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh, come on! You do it all the time. Besides, I'm trying to make a good first impression here! You think I can be chill with him right off the bat, like I am with y—? Ah...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Haha. You can if you'd like! I don't mind it at all. So, what do you need me to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Just as you requested, I've brought you a descendant of the House of Rising Ashes, and fused you with the stone. So, can we bring back Kagutsuchi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, there's something we need Logi to see first. All the lives that have come and gone in Wadatsumi, since ancient times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Th-this is like what Amane was describing before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Kagutsuchi, Sumeragi, and Mikaboshi... My ancestors were there with each of them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>More importantly... All of this was quashed—all of it destroyed—by Malice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yet their will, and their memories, live on...within my blood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. I know it's a lot to take in. I'm sorry to throw it all at you at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But we need you. You're the most important piece of the puzzle for bringing peace back to Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Logi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I understand. So how do I do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You'll help us, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>How can I not, after what I just saw?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If Kagutsuchi requires my blood, then I happily offer up everything I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>For Wadatsumi's sake, and for my own as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Thank you. Thank you so much, Logi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So, come on, then. What's first?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Easy. You need only speak the Vow of the Phoenix as you saw it in the memories of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That should establish the covenant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Urk! I can't remember the words exactly, myself. What about you, Logi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Phoenix, heed my call. In the name of Aquila Rubrum, I beseech thee...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Imbibe my royal crimson blood, beat your wings, and reign divine fire unto the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>How did you memorize that so quickly?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>When I saw it, I just had a feeling I'd need to know it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That should be it. Kagutsuchi should now be restored. Let's get you out there to deal with Tam—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Not yet. There's still one problem left unresolved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I've only ever trained with a sword. I have no idea how to...activate Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So, what are you saying? You've established the pact, but you can't call upon the power it affords you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I honestly did not see this coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I-I'm so sorry! But, it's not too late! I'm sure there's something we can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Like what?! It'll take ages to train you! Like, literal ages!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wait... You wield a sword, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Logi, watch this! Huzzaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>How... Where did you learn that form?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I don't understand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Father showed me that very same technique long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Remember this form. Practice it until it becomes second nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Why only me? Why can't Dias learn this too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Because he will not be able to wield it. Or... Perhaps he will, but not to its fullest potential, nor for its intended use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I don't understand, Father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Here. Just stand at the ready. Though I pray you never have to see the day this form becomes necessary...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Its intended use... So that's why Celis knew this technique!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Your father, Zeke, taught it to her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Even though it wasn't used for its intended purpose, she mastered it, and managed to envelop her blade in flames!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>In other words, this form is Kagutsuchi, only...converted, as a technique of the sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It's...Kagutsuchi? Is that even possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It must be! So, if you could master this form...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You could use Kagutsuchi through swordfighting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'd be able to use Kagutsuchi, with my sword?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yes. It's because your swordsmanship reminded me so much of Celis' that this even came to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Can I really...? Will you help we with this, Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Absolutely! Let's start training right away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Thank you!</td>
</tr>
