<td>Um... What? This looks like where we just came from. Could we be lost?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Maybe, maybe not. We have been wandering around in this cave for quite some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Of course...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are you okay, Su Yi? Are you tired? You've seemed okay lately, but we don't want to risk... Su Yi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The rugged rock walls, the moistened earth, the smell of the tide... We're really here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is where The Adventures of Joe Vandelle... I can't believe we're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Xiao-Xiao?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh! Sorry! I got a little lost in the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Nothing wrong with that! This is where Su Yi's beloved tales of adventure took place, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It is. It brings back so many memories. Whenever visiting, Xiao-Xiao would always read that book.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Of course. They were the best stories of a great pirate who would brave any danger in pursuit of treasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>In the tales, this was where the one of The World's Most Fragile and Precious Treasure came from. How I've longed to come here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Just setting foot here and walking in this cave is so thrilling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Really? Well, I'm glad to hear that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, so long as you're happy... But I am getting a little anxious to find this treasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Having seen most of the cave on our long stroll, I think I have a pretty good idea of the place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The only place we haven't been to is around here, so the treasure must be nearby.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hah! Su Yi, you're always so clever! That means very soon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Wait. There's monsters. Let's go ahead, Xiao-Xiao.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Right! Su Yi, wait here. We'll push that way and take care of the threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>B-But... I can fight, too! My medicine is working, and my seizures...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No, no, no! We can't have you straining yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We'll be right back, so just hide behind this rock for now. You'll be safe here. See you in a jiff!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(This again... Every time a monster pops out, this is what happens.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(I understand why they worry about me, but I'm really fine now...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(I want to carry my own weight as a pirate. I want to become strong and stand alongside everyone else.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Footsteps?! Who could it be? I better hide...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Eh? What's this child here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Eh? What's that? I can't hear you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Captain! More monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Gah... More of you? You ants keep crawlin' outta the cracks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Y'all get ready for a fight! And I'll teach you what it means to face Gormalas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
