<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Mm, yes, Vlad, it is rather nice that they don't even bother with you until last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You two definitely both need to work on your self-esteem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's all water under the bridge, either way. At this point, they would never rerun an event like Mobius where the three of us all get to show our faces again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So where does that leave us, then? Are you saying our only job now is dropping the Figurine of Wrath?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Please, stop! I'm getting more depressed by the second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>At any rate, I don't think I've done anything to make people dislike me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hmm. I suppose not. Wait! Garuda Charge! You have your Garuda Charge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That ability certainly isn't winning you any friends, I surmise. Just when they think they've hit you for major damage, they get their HP drained and are left in critical condition!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm certain of it! That must be the root cause here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Pfft. As long as they attack me from anywhere other than the front, back, or sides, Garuda Charge is of no concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Pardon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>They can just attack from a diagonal position! Not to mention, abilities that negate Reactions are becoming far more common. Truth be told, I can barely ever score a hit with that thing anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>On top of that, they can just not attack in the first place. They only need to survive until the end, after all. So Garuda Charge isn't the problem here; trust me on that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(You sure don't hesitate to expose your own weaknesses, do you?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If combat style is what you're thinking, Neville, then I'd say you're just as likely to be the culprit here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>On account of what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>On account of that Figurine of Wrath quest. You evade like crazy during that fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I do, but that's just part of my character. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Maybe so, but everyone just wants to get through that quest as quick as they can, and your Evasion drags it out for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, so what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So, it's an uphill battle in the first place for that to even be your thing, since nobody likes Evasion-based characters to begin with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What? Are you saying people hate Evasion characters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes. Just look at Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Mm, indeed. No one likes him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But, I don't evade nearly as much as Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Which is, itself, something people are going to dislike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh? Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Waginau is in everyone's heads as an Evasion character.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So when their attacks miss him, they just accept it. But with you, it's not really what you're known for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So when you evade them at a fairly decent rate, it comes off as...irritating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But, I'm just as much an Evasion character as Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>People don't really think of you as one, though. Much like us, they don't really think of you as having much character at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Or in other words, they don't really think about you. Period. So quit acting so full of yourself! In the end, you're just not that important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Good Heavens. Neither of you have any confidence in us whatsoever, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Point is, in the end, people probably dislike you more for your Evasion focus than they do Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm not more disliked than Waginau! I can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>No, no. I think you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm definitely in better standing than him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Then why is it Waginau has been released, and you haven't?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>He beat you to the punch, Neville.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>There's no clearer sign. Doesn't matter what you may think or how you may justify the situation; the proof is in the pudding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What's important is being able to recognize your own shortcomings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Only when you can say to yourself, "people dislike me more than Waginau," can the healing begin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Acceptance is the first stage of...a lot of things. But as of yet, you haven't accepted reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>So let me just be frank with you: if you can't do at least that much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>...then you have no hope of ever getting released.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>That applies to you as well, you know! Why are you talking like it's only my problem?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>We're kind of a package deal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Now, now. Let's not throw a fit, here. I understand how you feel, believe me. A little too well, perhaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>We are the Deadly Trio. All for one, and one...would be fine, honestly. But you're right, we're a package deal, for better or for worse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Forever fighting side-by-side for the good of Wratharis, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Honestly, the more I think about it, the more I could see you being the only one of us getting skipped over. It could happen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>No, it couldn't. We're all in the same boat here! Ugh, can we just talk about something else, already?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I thought maybe I'd messed up big time or something, but no! You guys are just trying to pin all the blame on me so less of it lands on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Well, you know what? I think my Evasion might actually increase my odds! Yeah... Having a character with high Evasion on your side is a huge boon. That little quirk may be my selling point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Nah. For guys like you who evade a ton as enemies, when they get added to the player's battle party and are actually used, they're somehow never even half as good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Now you're just being mean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Evasion units don't have much offensive power, either, so they're never as useful as they sound. They wind up getting benched pretty quickly, and nobody ever looks back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You're one to talk! What have you got going for you? You'd be benched from the get-go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You said it yourself: I've got Garuda Charge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Garuda Charge! We just talked about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>But, you said it'sâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>That's as an enemy! It's different as a playable unit. When players have Garuda Charge available, they use it all the time! It keeps you from dying, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'll be in high demand just for that alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You'd know I'm right if you weren't such a noob.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>As for me, I'm a straight-shooter. No one will ever mistake what I'm all about. I'm the guy who inflicts Rage! So I've got no reason to worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Who's going to use a character that just inflicts Rage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Not a problem. If I get added in-game, they'll definitely buff me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>How can you be so sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Isn't it obvious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Not to me. What makes you so confident?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Come ooooon. Don't make me say it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>But, I really don't get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Do we have to do this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Just drop it. Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Tell me, and I will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Because I'm the main one! There! You happy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I'm the main one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Of the three of us. They made me the leader. You think us, you think me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>No, that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>That...isn't true...</td>
</tr>
