<td>Ack! There's no end to his strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hyahahahah! It is my responsibility to trump all! That is my belief...and the purpose of my existence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What is your goal?! What are you thinking... invading on your own?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What I desire is proof of my own strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Are you saying that your objective differs from that of the Gluttony army?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Not entirely. Invading is a means to prove one's strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Is that your reason for invading Saga?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Of course, there is Gluttony's side as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Beelzebub originally belonged to Gluttony Foss. Thus, of course, they would attempt to take it back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If denied their right, they have no choice but to take it back by force. Isn't that a legitimate reason?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>For starters, the people of Saga have nothing to do with this dispute. What need is there to involve them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>South of Gluttony Foss, the desert is continuing to spread. Along with this, both food and water are beginning to run out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If a country cannot support itself, then it must take from another. That is the way history has constantly repeated itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That in no way justifies this invasion! Gluttony has a trade agreement with Tehre.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Shouldn't that provide enough food and water?! There shouldn't be any need to invade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...Hyahahahah! Tehre approved our invasion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Tehre approved it...?! Why?! What is he thinking?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Heh. Knowing the reasoning behind his decision won't allow you to prevent it. Let's just say that Tehre holds the same beliefs that we do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>As a result, this invasion has been set into motion. That being said, I have other intentions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Then what exactly are you after?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Isn't it a given that people must forge their lives with their own hands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm well aware of that! I don't need you to tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No. You are aware of nothing. You burden nature in order to sustain your existence. You've abandoned your responsibility!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...?!</td>
