<td>003</td>
<td>Documents... Several samples...</td>

<td>Personal effects, even.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What would Goetia want with these things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's more likely they filched the entire lot from the town's investigators, then tossed it unceremoniously into a bag.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hmm. A leather journal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh. It's a diary of some sort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Let's have a look...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wait-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...Sieg and I went to visit Teacher today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>As usual, though, no one answered the door.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sieg and I even took the time to line up our breaks so we could come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No one's home. She must have gone out somewhere again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Or gotten lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Let's get the spare key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There we go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Of course you would know where it is. You're the one getting locked out all the time, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's because YOU lock me out in the first place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Nobody's going to stay up past midnight to wait for you to drag your grubby behind home, Sieggy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hey, I was out training and lost track of time...</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>I had to enlist Soren's help in rounding up those droids...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We almost got into big trouble, too. Thankfully it all worked out with Blair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Still, seeing her so happy in that snappy new suit was worth all that hassle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Just thinking about it brings such warm fuzzy feelings to my heart...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>

<td>When was the last time Sieg was around to receive the gifts I made for him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Chocolate doesn't last long!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Especially if it's homemade...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I know he cares for me, deep inside. I can't be the only one who feels this way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>After knowing each other for so long and going through so much, surely he...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ehehe. It would be nice to be in a beautiful white dress of my own someday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>To have and to hold...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>For better, for worse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>In sickness and in health...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Stop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That's...enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If it makes you feel any better, I don't find myself suddenly flooded by lost memories...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Although I have a vague recollection of some of these...I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What about this, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What's this... 'Casualty report'?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Adult female body recovered from premises...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hair: pink. Eyes: blue. Facial features-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Blue eyes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(Where am I...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(It's cold...and it's hard to breathe.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(Some kind of tube...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Biologically stable...good, good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ah. Awake already, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Let's have a look, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Almost a perfect likeness... Her will is astounding, astounding indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(Is that- Me?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(But... How? I'm here, but my body is-)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>The Doktor turned away for a moment, and there, I saw her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Off to the side, lit by a cold, sterile light...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>The real Roxanne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Who... What am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I felt something off when we first met...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But never did I think it would be something so heinous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Roxanne...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>STOP SAYING THAT NAME!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I know. I'll silence you forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>No one would ever know. This is all a lie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Forgive me, Roxanne.</td>
