<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ngh... This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We saw this within Mikaboshi's consciousness, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's the result of uncontrolled and powerful negative emotions run amok.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The question is, are these all his own feelings, or were they instilled in him by someone else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Either way, we need to set him free!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Rgh! Looks like he's getting stronger! But we must persevere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Right. We have to get him to snap out of it. It could be a bit tricky, but it's clear that's the right course of action here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We must do our best not to harm him. For the pride of the Blade Fox, we cannot turn our blades on those who are, themselves, little more than victims. Not anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Let's go, Jubei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You good to go, little lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm going to have to be. How about you, Edgar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Do you still believe we should've killed Tamba when we had the chance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What, don'tcha trust me? I told you, I'm fully prepared to do things your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'll fight however you guys want me to. I trust you all. That's why I'm here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>As you said, Amane, we need to get Tamba to remember what he wanted to protect. That may be the key to restoring Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Everyone's put their faith in those words. All our wills and destinies are aligned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You've bound us all together with your words, and we are stronger than ever for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Logi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We won't be defeated now. I'll use my sword to carve a new path toward that future if I must!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Agatha, when Tamba lets down his guard, initiate the plan. The rest of us will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'll be praying for our victory. May those prayers sustain our resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And I'll be praying for Tamba, too, that he may finally be released from his long-held suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Let's free Tamba and settle this, once and for all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's taken much too long, but now that everyone's thoughts and feelings are aligned, I know we can do this. This is our comeback!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Wait for us, Tamba! We'll save you yet!</td>
