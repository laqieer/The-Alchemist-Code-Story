<td>Shion handing out compliments? Now that's a rare sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It was but a simple endeavor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Still... we brought even more trouble upon the beachgoers, I don't think we can make up for it all now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Eira... sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What are you all apologizing for? Weren't you fighting to protect everyone from the beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No one got hurt, and the fight was pretty amazing to watch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah, the way you blasted away all those wolves was amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Did you see how the little one pounced on those octopuses? She was so cute and so fierce at the same time, somehow that just makes we want to hug her even more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Mhm! In fact, this might just be the most unforgettable summer memory. I think we can all agree that that is repayment enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It seems that our patrons greatly enjoyed our unintentional performance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well... if everyone says so, then I guess it's all good then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So, what are we going to do about the competition?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Seeing as the food might draw out even more of the beasts, I am willing to concede a draw for today's match.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I agree, I do believe we have all seen enough excitement for one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I guess we'll settle this some other time then. But not in front of Seigfried! He's completely off-limits!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Believe it or not, I am actually rooting for you Miss Roxanne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Perhaps I could provide you with a few pointers? Maybe a lesson or two in my arts of attraction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I don't need your tricks, I'll win Sieg over with my own effort! I'm sure of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The bickering continues even as the sky turns a stunning crimson with the light of the setting sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Ahhh, how long has it been since I've felt this way? I can't remember when I last enjoyed human company free of avarice)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(Eira's friends are truly an interesting bunch. Perhaps meeting them again in the future would be... enjoyable)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The day isn't over yet. We're going to party twice as hard to make up for the lost half of the day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yeahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>With a loud cheer, the fun continues well into the night.</td>
