<td>Eep! What the heck is happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The moment I start climbing the tower, just as I was told to, this happens! What's the big idea?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>All I said was that we should make a start on meeting Nimul and the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ugh... First those machine soldiers, and now falling debris... How are we supposed to get anywhere?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Stop wasting your breath on complaints and help me already, Mira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If you don't, it might actually come crumbling down! Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Grraaaooogghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That magil-soaked roar tells me Belphegor must be getting close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Urgh... Of course this must occur when we've been split up and we don't have our best weapons...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Is everyone all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Adaleigh?! What happened to you guys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There's a lot to catch up on, but we don't have time for that right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We need to come up with a plan while Belphegor is still restrained!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What do you mean, Belphegor's restrained?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ah... That explains it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What, Nyx? Don't just keep it to yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>See that, Mira? There, where the wall of the tower is crumbling...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Grrrooooaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Whoa! Does that mean...it's locked on to this tower?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast is trying to free itself from the restraints Icona made to capture it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If it slips back underground, it'll take forever to catch up with it again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>In the worst case, this whole region could sink under the power of the ensuing earthquake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>My... You have...an awfully good grasp of...the situation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You! You're...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Do you never tire?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Never! At least... That's what I'd like to say, but...the fact of the matter is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Blegh... Ugh. Sadly...it seems I've taken...a fatal wound, myself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...Why hang around here when you're bleeding like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I...already told you... Preparing a contingency plan...is part...of a researcher's duty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's a...high quality stone of the gods compacted...into...a very handy...jackhammer knuckle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I call it...Antares. Heh heh... Neat, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's packed with Sloth magil... It should be able...to penetrate Belphegor's...outer shell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Why didn't you make it into a ranged weapon at the very least?! Who the hell is gonna get close enough to use this thing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Listen closely, Adaleigh... The Cursed Beast, Belphegor, is...very powerful...but it has no intelligence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It just...follows its instincts...and repeats simple attacks...over and over... You're smart enough...to figure out its patterns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Well, so are you! You're way more brilliant than I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>How lazy you are, Adaleigh... Look at me. Surely you can see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm done for. It's...well past...time for you to stand on your own... You're a capable adult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Icona...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Congratulations... You've won...our very first...sibling squabble, Adaleigh. You're...all...grown up...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ah, well... This is the end...for my research, too... I had fun, though. It's too bad, but...let me just say one...last thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I couldn't...save anyone...my way. So this time...try it your way...Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I believe in you, Adaleigh... I'm proud to call you...my brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh, Icona...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Adaleigh... Now's not the time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I know. It's all right. I can do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Everyone, I need your help... Lend me your strength so we can save this region!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, if we must... What would you do without us, Adaleigh? Don't you feel lucky you've got us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You did everything in your power to save the region we live in... So of course we'll lend you a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>This blade of mine might have been hastily put together, but I will push it to its limits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We of the Sephira would never forsake those in need of rescue. My sword is at your service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I, too, will do everything in my power to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Thank you so much, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It would seem that all of us are in agreement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Nimul! You made it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I did. And what's more, I've succeeded in completing a new technique... No, a new school of Spiritbonding entirely. I call it alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I believe that we now have what it takes to face Belphegor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Right, then. Let's do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Well, if we want to recover Libra, this has to come first. I knew it would come to this, I guess, but I'm still kind of freaking out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Mira, quit babbling and help me make these adjustments! We've hardly got any time to sync Libra up with all of this idle magil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah, I know... So what do you want me to use to focus this magil, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It would have to be this: Antares.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You mean Icona's...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yeah. The core of this thing is made up of the stones of the gods collected in this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>If you're going to sync to the magil in this region, then this is our best bet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>To activate Libra's Anti-Curse function, someone will have to land an attack on the Cursed Beast with those knuckles, first...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You know that, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Of course. Icona said she believed I could do it, so I'll get it done. Piece of cake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Then I'll make the adjustments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Do we even know if this airship will fly? Didn't it need a complete overhaul when we arrived in this region?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>As it happens, all of that got taken care of while it was confiscated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>While it was confiscated...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Apparently, the mayor ordered it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>The dockworkers said he'd left instructions that it be returned to us in the worst case scenario.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>In the end, I still don't know if Icona and the mayor were our enemies...or...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>We were all doing our best to save this region in our own ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>We just had conflicting ideas about how to achieve that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Having the same dream for the future doesn't mean we can join forces to achieve them. This has really opened my eyes to that fact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Here we go. Engine's running! Full speed ahead! Hold on tight, people! We're about to ram that Cursed Beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Is the vein getting agitated...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Judging by the method used to restrain Belphegor, Icona must have introduced something into the vein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>What better way to restrain something with such a massive amount of magil than to pump an equal amount of magil into it? That's the most likely answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>However, that now seems to be increasing Belphegor's domain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Now that the clocktower's functionality has been suspended, all that magil is vulnerable to Belphegor's control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>If we can reboot the tower, maybe we can hamper Belphegor's movement somewhat...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>We just don't have enough hands to go around for that right now. We'll have to focus on what we can manage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Mira! Nyx! Is Libra up and running yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>It's happening. We've got this! Analysis of sloth-based magil complete... Distribution of magil through the domain is almost done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I think we can neutralize most of the magil within the domain, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>We won't be able to take it down completely unless Adaleigh hits Belphegor in the core with those knuckles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>In that case, it falls to us to make way for him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I have gathered up every last sword onboard the airship, so leave it to us to clear the way forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>This is it, then! Let's take on the Cursed Beast Belphegor!</td>
</tr>
