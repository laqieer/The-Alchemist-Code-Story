<td>I have been searching for a version of myself that could be beloved by another for so, so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>A version of myself that is neither afraid, nor a lie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Perhaps I am a plucked rose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Y-you wield twin blades like Yauras!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No, you're wrong. Yauras has twin blades like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Once I did not even possess buds with the potential to bloom, yet now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>In agility! In swordsmanship! In grace! I'm above her in everything!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I am the fake?! You've got to be kidding me! That little rat is the one who is copying me in everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I may blossom with grace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What a wonderful moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The famous Yauras being carved by my blade...and kneeling pathetically!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's almost like a dream!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ugh...! Wh-why do you see me as your enemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Of course... You wouldn't remember me, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Have we met before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Though I may go unseen by all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Do you remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...I didn't think you would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But...I still remember you clearly in that moment like it was yesterday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I can surely still blossom with grace. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Goodbye...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Agh?! Ngah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What a poor soul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If you are reborn...then you should live...however you wish to live...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This is how I will die. I will slip from this world, having lived a pitiful life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yet perhaps this is why I won't simply fade away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I was a brazen beast, clad in a costume of lies, laughing profanely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I was unsightly filth, lower than a weed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That is who I was back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wake up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Iris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Shut your trap, old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What are you doing in my vault of stolen goods?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ahahah! Why shouldn't I be in here? A bed of jewels, a pillow of doubloons! A crib for me, myself, and I!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Sparkly, dazzling, gorgeous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Get yourself ready, you lazy sod! We've gotta get out of here! Bloody hell... Cauldrons and curses!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wh-what's up with you? We're leaving already? Can't we wait 'til morning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>A Wratharian national treasure was among the goods you stole, you dolt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That makes us an enemy of the nation! After all that chaff about there being nothing to worry about... That blasted client tricked us! Curses!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>W-we could hold them off, no problem! We're the Golden Wolves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Don't be absurd! A tiny band of thieves like us would be stamped out before we had the chance to say diddly-squat. Now, is there gold in your ears, or are you just ignoring me, lass? Get yourself ready or I'm leaving you behind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We're just going to flee?! In the middle of the night?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The Wratharis Guard is going to assault our base come dawn. The others...don't know about it yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Let's load ourselves up with all the booty we can and get ourselves out of here! We're family, we only need each other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Y-you mean...just leave everyone behind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Iris, listen to me! Iris...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>D-don't touch me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I know I've put you through some rough times, but this is our chance to clean our hands of this business! We can live a good life off of this gold, and never have to steal another penny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You're more important to me than any of these fools, Iris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>B-but I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I don't even care about all this loot. Not compared to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Everything gleams like gold in my memory of this time; the goods we stole, the days that rolled on byâ€”even my old man's dirt-stained cheeks and crooked grin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Let's live an honest life together. Just you and me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>W-well... Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Apologies for the wait, gentlemen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Wratharis soldiers?! We need to run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Heh...heheh... Hold on, now. This is all part of the plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You will hand over our national treasure, as well as a large portion of your assets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Heheheh, of course, of course. Then you will crush the Golden Wolves and have medals of honor placed around your necks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>And...you will be so kind as to forget I was ever here, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hand over the assets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yes, yes, of course. Right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Um... J-just so you know, I have no intention of giving up the goods I've stolen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Oh, yes. That's perfectly fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>No skin off my back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You are one of the assets that we will be taking into custody.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Wh-what?! No! It's a lie, isn't it, old man? You said... You said we would live an honest life together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Together? No, no, no. I'm using you to save my own neck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>She's not bad. Not bad at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You're mine! I can do whatever I want with you and all my loot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Ahahahahahahahahahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Nrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The old geezer's gone, girlie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Heheh... That makes you ours now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Don't be absurd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You've been sold out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Shut your mouth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You've been abandoned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I don't belong to anyone but myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>All of you are going to pay with your lives for this... Die!</td>
