<td>001</td>
<td>Alert! They've breached the castle! We don't know where these corrupted Ira Knights are coming from, but—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Your Highness, that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I was waiting for them to show up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What should we do, Your Highness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Imnus, you gather the troops and take control of the chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes, Your Highness! At once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You can come with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I will take this chance to show our precious Shield Maiden the true might of the Invidia Belt knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The strength of our knights comes not from their might in battle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Instead, true power reveals itself when it's wielded to protect something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Nimul! I think the explosion came from over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Fire! We have to extinguish it before the whole castle lights up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Got it. "I am Transcender of the Gate of Lust!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Emmel, are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Are you hurt? What was that sound—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ngh! Nimul? Good, you're here—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yna, what's happening—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Your swordsmanship is worthy of praise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But even a master cannot win when he's outnumbered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That shield...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I fixed up your national treasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>As long as you wield this thing, any middle-of-the-road attack isn't going to leave a scratch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We're all out of the Sephirium we snuck out now though... Well, it was worth it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The Silver Shield! But it matters little if you don't have the right person wielding it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ngh! I knew it, we don't stand a chance against a Fallen that's already absorbed this much corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yna! Damn, he's calling forth those fallen shadows again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Space-Time Manipulation isn't working! Emmel, Eulalia! Can't you fight the corruption with Spiritbonding?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Groooooooaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It's not working!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Back in the Gula belt we didn't have trouble purifying this kind of corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Haha, fools! You don't even understand that much? Your techniques rely too much on concentrating the magil into a single blow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But my magil is the type that burns down everything it touches! It will not bend to such a weak will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Your power is nothing in the face of my wrathful corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>So this is the Ira Belt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>They must have developed a close-combat style that combines the sword and the body because those scorched lands were not suitable for other techniques...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Then I ought to face him with a sword in hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>King of the Ira Belt, I am your opponent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That sword... I see that there is still a genuine knight in the Invidia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You are mistaken. This is not the sword of one of our knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>This blade was made to carve out a future for our citizens, to protect our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>For a brighter tomorrow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You're all talk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The blade of wrath... I'm sure it is supposed to bring calamity and ruin, a fearsome thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But we cannot give into fear. There are people that believe in us, that await our victory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Your Highness, please stand back! It's the Shield Maiden's duty to protect—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>No. I cannot do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>All knights of the Invidia Belt are sworn to protect and rescue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You! Why are you still fighting me when you know you cannot win?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What is this power...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>A chivalrous knight puts everything on the line and stakes their mind, body and soul on the shield that guards! That is giving it all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That is the vow that the Mesarthim, the very first Shield Maiden left us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>As protectors, we must build and protect a place where people can live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That is what the Silver Shield you inherited symbolizes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>A place where people can live...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Daphne, you are not alone. We are always with you, even if...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Even if this old man were to perish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>As long as you have something to protect, you'll find a way to keep moving against all odds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You will never be alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Your Highness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Arghhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Nrck—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Enough of this chatter! A king stands alone! He steals and rules over all from his solitary throne! I will show you what a true king looks like!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...Thank you, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I think I finally understand. I might be the Shield Maiden, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>This duty and this shield, these are not burdens that I carry alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>That's right... You're not alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Wield your shield and focus on what's in front of you. There is no need to worry about the rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Keep moving without fear of failure... All you need to do is the things you believe are right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>How long are you going to keep up this charade—!</td>
</tr>
