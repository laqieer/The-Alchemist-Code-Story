<td>I suppose I'll have to start writing my next resignation letter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's not over yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Do yourselves a favor, and give up already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Othima, she's all yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Here we go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hm... I'm afraid freezing me in place isn't going to do you any good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Way ahead of you, buddy! Come on out, my friends! It's playtime!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaah! Wh-what in the world—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You couldn't lay a hand on my innocent pals here, could you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Tch! No... I suppose I can't, at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>W-wait a minute! Stop that! That's mine—give it back! Not my Antie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sorry, but you can't beat the power of friendship!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You're not playing fair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ready, everyone? Attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Z-Zain! Unhand me at once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Othima, it's now or never!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You know, I'm actually starting to feel pretty bad for using cowardly tactics like this. Maybe I should even out the odds a bit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Aaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Gwaaarghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's your solution? Hit us both?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>All's well that ends well, I say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That was a pretty good punch, Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's called magic, my dude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well, your magic packed a punch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Heh. Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's not like you to fight so dirty, Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Call it what you want, but I'd say my strategy was pretty effective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Othima, you have my gratitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No need to be so stiff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm sorry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You're one of my friends too, y'know? Relax.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I suppose you are tackling some things head-on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>My father always had high expectations for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Aren't I always?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I strove to live up to those expectations every single day, in order to please my mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's who you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It was all I could provide them. It was the very least I could do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Shh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Northern Pride: Archives (Reminiscence of a Memory)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ouch! Those book corners are more lethal than a dagger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What are you even complaining about? Oh, woe is me, the boy from a noble family? Are you trying to get a rise out of me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Of course not. I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You're descended from a prestigious lineage. I'm sure both your parents are alive and well, and continue to want the best for you; pouring their wealth into your education and training, all so that you can become a fine knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You don't have to worry about a thing—it's all laid out for you, isn't it? That's why you can afford to dream about world peace. Still planning on bathing this entire world in your light?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>For someone who's supposed to be a model student, you're awfully dim. Fools like you don't deserve to live alongside the hardworking people of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I don't have anything to research today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm only here because I wanted to express my gratitude. Here... This is for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>A... bookmark?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Surely your hatred of me doesn't trump your love of books?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>These pressed flowers... They're asters, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Will you accept it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Do you know what asters mean in flower language?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>There's a meaning? I just thought they were pretty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Ugh... How lazy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>People usually tell me I'm a pretty hard-working guy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You're impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You don't like it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Why are you giving me this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'd hoped it might light up your life a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Well, tone it down a little. You shine too bright for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But that's my goal—the brighter, the better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>If you don't cut it out, I'm going to bludgeon you to death with this book.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I don't doubt it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Isn't it unfair for you to direct all this kindness my way? What about everyone else in the world? Don't they deserve some of this unwelcome attention, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>All my life, it's other people who have been given everything, while I've been left with nothing but scraps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Try to cover it up all you want, but this world isn't at peace. Though I suppose that hasn't affected your social status, Sir Knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I... see your point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You really want to light up the world? Then quit wasting your time with me, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I refuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Just leave me be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I'm afraid I can't do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>And why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You know, I've sent a lot of letters to my mother. More than I can count.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I— Wait, what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Never mind. Perhaps I shouldn't tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Oh, no you don't! Out with it! Don't leave me hanging!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Incredibly bright, my mother. A preeminent civil servant. She, too, always longed to see the world at peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Throughout my life, she's always been loving and bright.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Even when I got fed up with my father's sense of justice, and fell into dark bouts of melancholy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>She would throw her work aside in order to wrap me in a tight embrace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>It was during that same, difficult year that she read me a certain book. It was a best-seller; a collection of historic tales about the Knight King. I wasn't particularly thrilled to listen to it at the time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Though I couldn't help but laugh at how serious she looked as she read it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>It was that memory, among others, that prompted me to send her so many letters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I wanted to know why she did it. Why she killed my father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>My father had dedicated his life to rising through the ranks of knighthood. Then, one day, my mother stabbed him, and it all came to an end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I was the one who found him. On his bed, in a pool of his own blood, a knife sticking out of his chest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>The room was completely dark when I entered. The oil lamp I carried was my only source of light. It lit upon him like a spotlight, leaving the rest of the room in shadow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I gazed around the room, swinging my lamp around. It was perfectly tidy. Unbelievably ordinary. Despite the lack of light, my mother was leafing through a history book beside the bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>My light did not fully reach her, and I was glad of it. I was frightened of what I might see if I illuminated her face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I don't blame you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>It was some time before I could force any sound out of my throat. In the end, I could only manage a single word: Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>And she told me... It wasn't good enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I never managed to find out more than that. I still don't know the full story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>"It wasn't good enough"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I can't help but wonder if things wouldn't have been different if I'd just shone that light on her, or asked more persistently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>If I'd only pushed aside my fears and asked to hear her thoughts... Perhaps that act alone would have helped her to heal, in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I failed her. I wasn't able to do for her what she did for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I didn't even give her a hug.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>So you see... Selfish though it may be, this is why I persist. I strive to accomplish now what I could not do back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>My apologies. I got a little carried away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>It was a long story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>This is the first time I've ever told anyone about... all of that. I don't know why I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>You did well, getting it off your chest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I... have to become a worthy knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>They never leave you, do they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Wh-what do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Those words you wish you'd said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>The regret... It stays with you, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Yet you cover it up with pretty words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Sometimes that's necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Why do you bother telling me these things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>If you get sick of listening, just throw a book at me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I do enjoy stories, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>In that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Next time, I'll tell you a story that'll make you smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Are you sure it's okay for you to spend so much time with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I want to get to know all of the people in this world. I'm choosing to start with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I want to hear your thoughts. Will you share them with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I promise I'll create a bright world for you to smile in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Remember: the promise we made is still unfulfilled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I'll light up every corner of this world, if that's what it takes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Pfft...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>You brightened my life. All I wanted was to shine some light on yours as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>As if you could make me smile.</td>
</tr>
