<td>Please...help. Um... I think...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Surely you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(I wake up only to find myself in unfamiliar surroundings. There are three little girls standing next to me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...Where am I? Why am I here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(Who are these girls?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey...what's going on?! Am I dreaming...ouch! No, it's not a dream!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What...happened? Where...am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hey, you over there! Do you know where we are?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, sorry! I'm Sakura. What's your name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm <p_name>. Yeah...where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I guess you don't know either. Anyway, nice to meet you, <p_name>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hey! What about you two over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm Tyrfing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm Chloe, Captain of the Crown's Guard that serves within Envylia's Blue Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Crown...Guard...Env...? Um, Chloe and Tyr...do you mind if I just call you Tyr?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't. Sakura, Chloe, and <p_name>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The problem seems to be that none of us knows where we are right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So...I'm guessing none of you know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...how to get back, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hey, didn't something just move over there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I saw it too! Let's peruse it! Everyone, follow meâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wait! You rogue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Sakura! It's dangerous to go on your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We have you cornered! You'd better come quietly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Is that...a girl? It doesn't seem like she's the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm Chloe. I'm a knight of Envylia. Please don't worry. You're safe now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We have no intention of harming you. Would it possible for you to tell us what happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You're not gonna hurt me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Sorry for chasing you just now. Did you also unexpectedly find yourself here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We want you to tell us what happened. Can you come out of there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Okay. As long as you don't hurt me, but...can you step a little back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Who are you people? What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh... I guess you're in the same boat as us. I'm Sakura! Nice to meet you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm Rena...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm Tyrfing. Rena, do you know where we are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...I don't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Rena is lost here as well. She seems to be alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm Chloe. Rena, would you like to join us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm not lost. But I don't know where here is. After all, here is here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hmm... What's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You all want to go back to your own world, right? I think I know how you can do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Really? How...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But I don't know right now. My memory is foggy, and...I can't seem to remember properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What's that supposed to mean? Try to remember! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I...want to. If only there was something that would trigger my memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, that's right...the doors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The doors? Are there doors here somewhere?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Look. They're right there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh, it's Zipangu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>There's Ragna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>And Babel too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I feel like the key for me to my memory lies beyond these doors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What do you mean "feel like"...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Well, which should we go through? I wanna go to Zipangu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm not sure...which door will lead us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I see. Rena doesn't say much, but her words hold weight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I think it might be worth going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>If we don't know which door will open, let's all go together! ...Um, which door should we touch?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Good idea. Don't worry. I will protect you all on my honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Well, I'm a kunoichi, so I can at least protect myself. Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Well then...one, two, three!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Did we arrive already? So which world is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hmm. From the look of it...it's not Zipangu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I can't see Yggdrasil. It doesn't look like this is Ragna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I can see the Tower of Babel! It seems like this is...Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Aww, man. So it's not Zipangu. Oh well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Huh? What's this black stuff? Mist? Is this world's mist black?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>No, it shouldn't be. What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Black...mist?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Step back! Don't touch it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Huh? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What's that sound?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>A monster assault...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hwahhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Oh! Someone is fighting over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Hyaahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Groooowl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ack. They don't stop coming! What is with these monsters?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Whoa! Some fancy lady is fighting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Shekinah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Tyrfing? What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Be careful... There's more coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Growwwwl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Shekinah! Let's talk later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You're right! First, let's take out the monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I'll fight on my honor as an knight as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>All right! I'll display my power as a kunoichi!</td>
