<td>001</td>
<td>Let's rest here for today. We need to keep our strength up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Nnrgh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What's wrong, Edgar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hey! Let me see that! You're injured! Did this happen last night?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Who cares? This is nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If I could only use my magic... I could make a wound like this heal over in a moment, but...there's still not enough Alchemia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh...? Something's...calling me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Kasumi...? Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Um... Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This herb... I think it's...! Edgar, show me your wound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>All done! How do you feel, Edgar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The pain is...gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I knew it! Nice one, Kasumi! I'm impressed that you knew about this herb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I didn't, actually. I just...felt like that plant was looking at Edgar's wound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huh? The plant was...looking at me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh! Um... N-never mind. Please forget I said that! I'm glad the pain is gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Mmm... Your cooking is the best, Kasumi! This seasoning is so delicious! I suppose this is what you would call Earth cuisine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm glad you like it! Mom's always telling me that I shouldn't cook or I'll hurt myself, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's really nice to see you enjoying my cooking. It...makes me happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Your mother sounds like a worrier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No, not really. It's just, I'm totally useless, so she feels like she needs to keep a close eye on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You wouldn't believe how clumsy I am. Sometimes even I can't believe it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Mom's always getting mad at me for trying to do things beyond my ability better left undone. Or... She used to... When...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You're not totally useless. In fact, you're not useless at all. You decided to face off against the Destrolurk all on your own, didn't you? If you can manage that, that's more than anyone could ever ask of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>E-Edgar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Thanks for dinner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Heheh... So, did you do anything else back on Earth? Besides cooking, I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, well... I've always liked the theatre, ever since I was little, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What?! You're an actress?! A-are you famous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>N-n-no! Not at all! It's just that when I was little, I loved playing pretend and acting out stories... That sort of thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It was what I'd do during playdates at preschool, and at the local park...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Now it is time to vanquish the evil dragon, and reclaim our hope! I will imperil my very life for the sake of this world—nay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>For whom this world— Aaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's when I fell... It was quite a distance. I was unconscious for several days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'll never forget the look on my mom's face when I woke up... I felt like I'd worried her half to death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>She was so mad at me, but it was my own fault for making her worry for me. After that, I never had anything to do with theatre again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I don't want to make my mom worry about anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But, Kasumi... Isn't that your passion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>So what? I-I can't tell her that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm sure, if you just talked to her about it, she'd understand. After all, she is your mother; that's what she's there for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I... Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>To be honest, when I first found myself in this world, I couldn't help but feel like I was being punished for something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That was how I felt, but now... I'm glad I got the chance to meet you, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'm glad, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, and Edgar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What am I, chopped liver?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Aahh! N-no, that's not what I meant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Pfft... Hahahahahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Look at them all. The Demons of Darkness are swarming around the Tower of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You can see them from all the way back here. They're even bigger than they were the last time we saw them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Not a whisper from the wind or a word from the trees... It is only a matter of time before this land will be swallowed up by the Darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Lisbeth, Edgar. It's been a while, hasn't it, you two?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>How are things in Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Everyone fighting for their lives...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>We have heard word of Kasumi... The Light Alchemist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The winds that blow within Kasumi do not whisper of the same strength of power possessed by other Phantom Soldiers. Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>She has something of her own; a certain...warmth, the likes of which I've never felt in another Phantom. What could this mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>U-um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Tina is a Wind Shaman. She can communicate with nature and spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive us, Kasumi. In due time, we are sure to cause you unimaginable suffering...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But still we must have you use your powers for us, at all costs. This world needs your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I...! O-of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Edgar, Lisbeth... May I have a word?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>So? What is it? I have a rough idea of what you're going to say, though... Seeing as you didn't want Kasumi to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The ancient text has yielded a new truth. When the Phantom Soldier who can seal the Darkness defeated the Destrolurk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>They, too, were defeated... Completely and utterly destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What?! No! Then...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>We will never be able to summon Kasumi again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>No! Kasumi... I can't do that to her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I knew it. Can't be helped, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>No! How could you...?! We can't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You've really changed, Edgar. You're nothing like the man I once knew!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You would have been unequivocally against something like this! You never would have allowed a girl to suffer on your watch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>And what about you, huh? You've changed, too. If you hadn't, then right about now you'd be defiantly telling me how you're going to save both the world and Kasumi, and that no one can stop you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>We have all lost far too much. That is why...in order for us to keep anything further from being lost...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>That's right. For the sake of this world...Kasumi must be destroyed. It's the only—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>K-Kasumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>D-destroyed... For the sake of this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>N-no! Wait! Kasumi, listen to me! I—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>It's all right... I'm already dead, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>It's not like I can return to my world, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>If this is all I'm good for, then...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>K-Kasumi...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Th-then...it's better this way, isn't it? I'll be destroyed for the sake of this world. That's so...so much better for everybody!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>This is bad! Her powers are spiralling out of control!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Kasumi, please! You need to calm down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>For the sake of this world...I... I'll...! I...will...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Zain?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Come. Together we will go...beyond the Void.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I...will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>No! Kasumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Kasumi! Tch! Damnit all!</td>
</tr>
