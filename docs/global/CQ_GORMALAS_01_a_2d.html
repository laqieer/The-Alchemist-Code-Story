<td>Captain! Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Stop screaming like that! It's pathetic! What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There's a ship up ahead! It's...a pirate ship! They're headed this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I see. Who are they to dare approach me in this manner?! They must have little regard for their own lives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Pirates! We have no intention of fighting! Please, open a path!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You have some nerve interfering with our graceful voyage! Your luck has run out now that you've encountered us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ack! Captain Gormalas?! We've encountered the worst person possible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Worst, huh? That's quite the compliment. You can leave your ship behind as well, while you're at it. Only your lives will be spared. If you defy me, I'll be taking those as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Unfortunately, I can't afford to give my life nor my ship. I've got to go on a treasure hunt right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>A treasure hunt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes! So, unfortunately, I don't have time to be dealing with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...I don't like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You're a pirate, aren't you? When you encounter a ship, you take it. That's the pirate's way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Please, try not to think that all pirates are like you. I'm not so downtrodden as to take that which I don't need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm a pirate, but I'm not a villain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What nonsense. A wimp like you who isn't prepared to steal from others shouldn't be raising the flag of a pirate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...! The real cowards are those who launch surprise attacks on others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>How dare you call me a coward?! We, pirates, are all or nothing! Isn't that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Say what you want, but I'm not dying here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Now! Retreat at full speed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tsk! You're not getting away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hmph! She's exceeded my expectations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What shall we do, Captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Chase that ship! Don't let it escape or it'll be a disgrace to the name of the Black Keels!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You're not going anywhere, missy. I'll show you what it means to be a pirate.</td>
