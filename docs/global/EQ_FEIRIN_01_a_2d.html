<td>Heheh. Delicious drink and food. This is the life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yet...I wonder what it is. No matter how much I drink, I don't feel good at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I finished work like usual and...no, it's not like usual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hahah! I'm impressed by the Pipa virtuoso! Besides, you're here with a beautiful woman! You add much color to this banquet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You honor me with your compliment. There is nothing quite like delicious wine and the music to accompany it. Come now, let's sing one more song.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I can't help the flow of wine. Ohoho. You're going to make me drink too much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Heheh. Enjoying oneself is a good thing. Please do drink more along with the music.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You will be the ruin of me! Gwahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(This man is today's target. What I need to do is the same as always. After he is dead drunk and returns to his room...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Heh. I truly have drunk too much. I do hate to leave the banquet midway, but I think I'll have a rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Indeed. Well then, let me take you back to your room.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Heheh. Rest well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Phew. Who would've thought the banquet would go on so long? It takes will-power to hold back from drinking this delicious alcohol. Well, it's work so it can't be helped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ah. So this is the mark's room. There's an odd atmosphere about it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...! What's this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Come on. He's already been killed! ...Well, I guess it makes things easier for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yep! All I did is perform! Play the Pipa and drink the alcohol...that's great! But why do I feel uneasy then?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Sigh... There's no alcohol left. Another bottle, old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Perhaps you should go easy on the drinks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Who are you? If you're a trying to seduce me then you best look elsewhere. I want to enjoy my drink alone and in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Besides, just because you're a good-looking guy, I'm no easy girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So don't bother me anymore. I'm enjoying myself drinking what I want and how I want...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That being said, you don't seem to be really enjoying yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh, and how would you know that?! I just met you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well, I never asked the opinion of a stranger who doesn't even care to name himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ah, my apologies. My name is Reimei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...Reimei?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey, man! I laid eyes on that woman first! Don't think you can just walk in here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...Your wandering eye is hardly appreciated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Sh-shut up! Women should be seen and not heard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What?! Where did that come from? Women should stay silent, huh? You suck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well, you're a real rowdy woman, aren't you? Heheh. Once I send this guy flying, I'll have some fun with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well, how about you say something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Drop that cocky attitude of yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>O-oww! Who is this guy...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(That was one fluid movement. This Reimei guy isn't just some random douche...!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...Now clear off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>A-argh! You'll pay for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>There are too many wandering eyes here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>H-huh? You're leaving?! I thought you...hold on a second...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hey, the check, old man! I'm leaving the money here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That guy...I need to chase him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hey, you! Um, Reimei...was it? Who are you...hic...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Great. Now I got the hiccups from running...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I told you to go easy on the drinks, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You really went too far just now! Now it's time for me to beat you to a pulp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>He brought his friends faster than I expected. I didn't really want to cause a scene, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Why do these kinds of people always flock together? Ack...I feel sick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You feel sick?! You wench! We won't go easy on you either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh, I feel sick because I drank too much...not that it really matters...hic...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You stand back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>There's quite a few of them so I'll lend you a hand. Besides, I kind of want to vent my frustration as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Are you really okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Tsk! What're you two playing at?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Seriously...that annoying voice of yours is just making me feel worse!</td>
