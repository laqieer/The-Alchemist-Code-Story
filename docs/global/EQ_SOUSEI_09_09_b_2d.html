<td>So Bianca failed and left things here to him, did she?</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>How inspiring to see them refuse to give up! Makes me almost want to follow them.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Father...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There you two rascals are! How glad I am that my dying breath wasn't wasted on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The plans of the Infinite Serpent have failed. You don't have to do this anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Do what, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Let's help Emmel and the others, Father. In Superbia Belt, they still honor your name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What we should do now is lend them a hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No. That is not the path I have chosen to walk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Father!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Daughter, our paths have already diverged. I have chosen a world where humans are little more than puppets, and you have chosen the humans themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We are no longer on the same side. I reject your proposition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Fa...ther...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ugh! You're so stubborn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tsk, tsk. You really are nothing like me, Helene. So emotional.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But you, my beloved child! You did well. You are free to do as you wish, and follow whomever you wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You say that so lightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Our human lives are much shorter than yours. That's why we're willing to bet a whole lifetime on faith alone. There's no time to see every alternative through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yet now you're telling me to just...throw all of that faith away?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Throw it away? I said nothing of the sort!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You are more than welcome to hold true and tight to your faith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But if you should determine it a waste of your time, there is nothing holding you to it. You are unbound now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...I'm free, you mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Then this is what I choose to do, of my own free will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ignacio?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Of course it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Goodbye, Father.</td>
