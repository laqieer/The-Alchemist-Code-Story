<td>...So...do you understand now, Fuu boy? Do you understand the crisis that threatens Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>In order to advance forward, itâ€™s crucial that I understand why you killed Alia, eradicated the power of the wind, and upset the natural balance of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'd also like to know why you have taken in the Alize descendants that carry the bloodline of Alia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You old fox...so you were eavesdropping!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Wind Temple, which is now under the control of the Fuu faction, is losing its power. Ever since that night, even the whereabouts of the Wind Matter have become shrouded in ambiguity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>How will it help to know the truth now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Part of the responsibility lies with me...I accept that. I focused only on the results of those past events and abandoned the will to learn the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's why I'm here kneeling before you now. With two Wind Shamans having emerged, this is the perfect opportunity to restore order to the power of the wind and to Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There's no need for this. I'll protect Saga with my own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I don't know why you're acting so stubborn, but at least tell me the location of the Wind Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...There's no need for me to tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I know where the Wind Matter is, Voda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Mocca, is that true?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Mocca! You keep quiet! I will not forgive any recklessness on your part!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But, Fuu...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I told you that I'll protect Saga...without Voda's help and without resurrecting the power of the wind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You just need to keep quiet and follow my lead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...You're wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Of course, it's better if all of you work together. I mean...doesn't this problem concern all of you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>At any rate, it's not your problem! You're a foreigner and this problem concerns only those of Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yeah, that's pretty much what I've been trying to tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...Fuu, what burden is it that you're shouldering on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Nothing. Cease your unnecessary prying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Mocca! Where is the Wind Matter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's lost its power so it's nothing more than the Matter's core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We are simply preserving its source, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I will not forgive any further insolence! Do you dare to underestimate the power of the Sprite Trio?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No! I just want to protect the land of Saga! Why can't you understand that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>How dare you question my actions! You forget your place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Mocca...you're back? Is everything okay? Are you hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Tamis! Yes, I'm okay. I just got back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Those eyes of yours....?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Both her height and appearance closely resemble Mocca. Is she...your sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes. This is my twin sister...Tamis. And...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Mocca, stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>She is the "vessel" which the Wind Matter resides within!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The "vessel" for the Wind Matter...?!</td>
