<td>002</td>
<td>This is the true reason those Paladins were snooping around in Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>After countless sacrifices and diligent experimentation, we finally managed to produce this stone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Was it not odd to you that the Bishop of the Holy Order himself would come all the way out here for a simple scouting mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>W-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is what they were after. I had a connection within the Holy Guard steal a secret document from their treasury.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I took the honor upon myself to continue their blasphemous studies: the replication of the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Impossible! The Sacred Stones are miraculous relics of unknowable origins! There is no way that anyone living today could replicate them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>As you say, the Holy Guard's studies were incomplete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We were lucky to even get this one successful sample after significant effort spent decoding complicated transmutations, collecting rare resources, and countless sacrifices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>However...this stone is empty. It has a capacity for power that can rival even the Sacred Stones, but as it is now, it is merely a vessel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Then I realized. If this stone holds no power of its own, then I could simply take it from somewhere else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>From somewhere else...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>At first my plan was to take Beelzebub's power, but King Narol hid its existence from me until the very end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The end...? You didn't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>He's dead. It was a fair trial by the people, so I'm sure he has no complaints.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No! His Majesty...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Sadly, the problem with the stone is that it can increase its power by devouring Alchemia, but it must be fed constantly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Luckily for us, we had this perfect solution sitting right under our noses this whole time! Sephiron, the Tree of Life! A tree with power comparable to that of the mythical Tower of Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>A mysterious manifestation of untold strength that makes even Waginau devote himself to its protection! If I could imbue the stone with its energy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Beelzebub itself would pale in comparison!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It is as if Sephiron herself was created to be nothing more than a vessel for my ascension!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hm... I know this creature. I have seen it appear on  extermination missions out in the countryside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The Jam, was it? They are capable of complicated maneuvers, but are predictable enough because all of them are rooted in the most basic instincts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hunger, reproduction, survival...fear of death. I believe it is also said that they have some sort of relation to Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>In other words, if exposed to the awesome purification power of Sephiron, they will panic and run berserk, like...this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yearrrgh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Do not allow yourself to be overwhelmed, K-Kamui! If they are just the Jam...then they should be no problem for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Isidore... I'm sorry. You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Remember what Lord Waginau said! Nngh... We must...destroy that...stone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Got it! Let us clear out the Jam blocking our path!</td>
