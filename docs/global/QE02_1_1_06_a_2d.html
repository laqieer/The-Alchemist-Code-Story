<td>Looks like we've managed to lose them. What's the matter? Why've you gone quiet on me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Was it true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Behind the scenes, did my father use the Sacred Stone Belphegor to dabble in the military industry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hm? That's a lie my client came up with. Why do you ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Actually, Alvarez told me the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He said that, while he was alive, my father had been planning on using the Stone to invade other countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't worry. Your dad wasn't the type of guy to do something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There was no lie in his eyes, when he told me that his job as mayor was to think of the future of the children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>A man's way of life is always revealed in his eyes; there's no mistaking it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You've got nothing to worry about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Once we find the Sacred Stone Belphegor, we should know what your father was thinking when he was alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I promise you I'll find it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So, you're searching for the Belphegor after all?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>To be honest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm more interested in discovering its location than the Sacred Stone itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>After all, I made a promise to one tough old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>My father...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm a little late, but I came to fulfill my promise to your dad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You want to discover his true intentions...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I want to fulfill an old promise. Let's do everything we can to find that Sacred Stone, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well then, now that's decided, how about we get something to eat. The cheese dog sold at that shop is supposed to be famous in this city. Hold on a second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>He's not a bad person...I'm certain of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Allie, don't you think that if we stick with him we can find out what father's true intentions were?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well, I don't know aboutâ€”ekekek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Allie! Wh-who are you people...mghhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Look how delicious they look, little lady. No wonder they're famous. Huh? Where'd she go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ekekek...Fi-Fiona was abducted, aye! We gotta go save...ekeke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What?! Tsk... Was it the Beckrams?</td>
