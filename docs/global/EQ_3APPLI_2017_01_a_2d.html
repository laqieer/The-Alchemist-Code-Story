<td>Swimming time â™ª I'm first to the swimming pool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's the first swimming lesson of the year at Venus School of Magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Alma and Rebecca are both late. They should hurry up and change!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh? What's that on the ground?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wow, it's a beautiful golden key! I wonder if someone dropped it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Somehow... It's shining so bright...eeek?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Someone...help. At this rate...the sun...the light will disappear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Please, before that happens...all the Sun Keys...please...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...Huh? Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hearing the voice, Lisbeth realizes that she is somewhere unknown to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm <p_name>. I felt like someone called me. By the time I realized it, I was here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, me too! I found a key near the school's poolside. Then, the key suddenly began shining...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I was engulfed by that light...and then began to hear someone's voice. Um, something about Sun Keys...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So you came here from "somewhere that is not here" too. It looks like there's only the four of us here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Judging from everyone's appearance, it seems like we've all come here during summer vacation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Vacation? Um, I'm Lisbeth. I'm a witch from the Venus School of Magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I was going to attend swimming class. What about you guys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm Killer Princess Laevateinn. I guess summer vacation hasn't started for students yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh. Nice to meet you. I-I'm Yuri. I'm a kunoichi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm <p_name>. I don't have any official title. Just a regular person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I was swimming in the sea when I found a golden key. Then there was something about Sun Keys, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh? Now that I think about it, where did the key go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh?! I can't find it anywhere...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We were transported here, but maybe the keys were left where we found them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh? I found mine! I still have my key!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This must be the Sun Key that the mysterious voice was talking about, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Can you show me? Yeah, I think it's the same key as the one I found.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It shone really brightly like the sun so I guess we can call them Sun Keys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh yeah. It was something like that. I guess everyone else heard that voice too, didn't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It said something about the sunlight disappearing... It was scary. If that really happened, that would be terrible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But, now that I think about it, before finding the key, the sunlight seemed to be weaker than usual. It didn't really feel like summer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>My country doesn't have summer, but...there were more cold days than usual...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The warmth of the sun was weaker where I came from too. It was covered by black clouds, and it was a little cold even though it was summer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It seems like something serious is happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But...what are we supposed to do with this information...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>While saying this, Lisbeth gazes at her Sun Key as if to search for clues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>If we asked this key, do you think we'd hear the voice again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well...I'm not sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I doubt the answer's that simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hey, voice person! If you can hear me, please answer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh! You can hear my voice properly. What a relief...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh?! There's light flowing out of the key! A-and a girl appeared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Are you the one who was calling out to us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yes! It was me. I wanted your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Oh, I'm sorry! I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Amaterasu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm sometimes called The One Who Governs the Sun...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Save that talk for later. You want us to help you, right? What are we supposed to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh! Th-that's right! I want you to help me get back the Sun Keys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Because, at this rate, the light of the sun will disappear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, recently the sunlight seems to be weaker than usual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Was that because the Sun Keys were taken?! What should we do?! This is serious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What exactly are these Sun Keys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oh...right. I should start with an explanation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The Sun Keys are tools that are necessary to control day and night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Each world has their own key, but they were all stolen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Who would steal something that important?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If your story is true then it sounds like they're not something that can be easily stolen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I also never expected this to ever happen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The Twilight Zone, which is where the keys were kept, is strongly protected by the sun. No one except for me should have been able to enter...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But the Twilight Zone was engulfed in negative energy, causing it to lose the sun's protection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It was unexpected...I never expected someone to be able to do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Mmm. I don't really understand, but in other words, you were careless?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Ohh! B-but that's not all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I have to focus on my work during the witching hour, the time when the day changes to night. That's why if someone tries to steal them then, there isn't anything I can do about it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>So that means you were careless, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Well...that wasn't my intention, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Whether or not you were careless...I get that somehow your opponent got one over on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Do you know what the motive of the person who stole the Sun Keys is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>It's the same as what I said earlier: to eliminate the light of the sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>To thrust each world into darkness...where the sun cannot reach...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What kind of problems are there specifically when a world is thrust into darkness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Complete darkness is a pretty big problem itself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Well, of course...but it's not just that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>In a world where light does not shine, the hearts of the people grow darker and darker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>They begin to lose hope, become pessimistic, and constantly mourn over their misfortunes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...What a terrible world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>We need to stop the person who could plot something so terrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Also...that means these keys have power stored in them, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Lisbeth points her Sun Key towards the four of them when...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Eeek?! They're coming after me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hearing the sudden change in her voice, everyone understands that Amaterasu is in trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>We'll come save you right away...oh, hey, where are you, Amaterasu?! We can't save you without that information!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>U-use the keys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>The power of the sun coming from the Sun Key will certainly guide you to where I govern the sun...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Then we gotta go right away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Sun Key...Please take us to Amaterasu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>In response to Lisbeth's prayer, light shines from the Sun Key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>The light emitted traces the sky, creating the outline of a golden door.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>What is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Where could that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Oh! I saw the same thing in a picture during class! It's Babel...it's my world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>The world you live in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Yes! Does that mean Amaterasu is somewhere on the continent of Babel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Let's go beyond the door...and into this land called Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>But are you okay with going to a world you're completely unfamiliar with?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I originally came here with the purpose of helping out so it doesn't matter where I go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I see. I feel more relieved going to your world, Lisbeth, than someplace unknown to all of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Yes, I'll be the guide! All right, everyone, let's go! Into the door!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>In order to help Amaterasu, the four of them leap swiftly into the world beyond the door.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>What fate awaits the four of them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Well, let's observe which way the chips fall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Huh...where are we? Is this the sea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>It appears so. You said that your country doesn't have summer...so maybe this isn't your country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Oh, yes...I think it's a nearby country. Maybe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>So where is Amaterasu? We need to help her immediately...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>She's on that ship docked over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>But it doesn't look like we can save her anytime soon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Uggraaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Ah, seriously...you scared me! Don't get in the way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>It doesn't look like we can ignore it! We'll have to push through...let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>We're here on a rescue mission...so maybe I'll use a little more of my strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Hyaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Hold on, both of you! Oh, I'll protect you, <p_name>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Using their individual weapons, the three girls rush forward.</td>
</tr>
