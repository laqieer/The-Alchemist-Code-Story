<td>You'll regret this, meddler!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Um...s-sir? Thank you for the help back there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Don't mention it! It was no big deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Anyway... That's an interesting device you've got there. Mind if I take a look?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh! Um...certainly. Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh. Incantation gear... Did you make this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well, actually, I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ryui! Is that you, dear? Now, I've been meaning to ask you... Will these pipes really give us water and electricity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>They should. They're made from cheaper materials, but their structure, at least, is identical to the ones used in the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wow! You're incredible, Ryui. I don't know how you do it. I can't thank you enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, it's really not all that difficult. And you don't need to thank me. I was laying incantation tubes up to my area, anyway, and your house just happens to fall in that range.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, nonetheless, I'm grateful, Ryui. Of course, sooner or later they'll probably get taken, so I'll be sure to make good use of them while I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You're just going to give up? Can't you do something to stop them from getting taken?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Would that I could, dearie. You know what this town is like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We don't get to keep nice things for long down here. Gangs and thieves are always on the lookout for something they can pilfer from us honest folk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh? Are those pipes what I think they are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If you think they're tapping into the city's electricity and water lines and diverting some of the flow to Real Heaven, then yes. They're exactly what you think they are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I see. In other words...you're a thief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I don't mean that in a negative way! If anything, I'm impressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You actually made these incantation tubes yourself? That's not something just anyone can do. How'd you manage it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>With great difficulty. But that's just life when you live in the slums. You don't get anything without working for it down here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It feels like everyone else has given up on improving their quality of life, but I certainly haven't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>After all, even in a place like this, there are things people can do to make their lives better. It's just a matter of putting in the effort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes, these slums are dangerous and squalid, and it's hard to make a decent living here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But just because something is difficult, that doesn't mean it's not worth doing, and anything is possible if you work hard enough. So that's the path I decided to follow: one of self-sufficiency and self-improvement!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(Not only does she know her way around incantation gear and machines, but I sense she has an aptitude for Alchemy as well. In other words...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Say... Have you ever thought about becoming a paladin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>A...paladin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's when you invited her to join the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes. I decided then and there that I wanted her on our side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>To help you with your side hustle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well... Okay, yes, that too. But my main motivation was to give her some better role models.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hah! I hope you don't mean us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The two of you, me, and even Captain Kaya—we all have something in common. We each have our own little side projects that we're working on when we're meant to be dedicated to the justice of the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But that doesn't mean that the justice of the continent isn't still important to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That's part of why you check in on Real Heaven, isn't it? It's not only for the extra coin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No, but it is mainly for the extra coin. And I don't like the sound of that Purification Plan one bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>So, she's from Real Heaven, huh? I suppose to her, every other paladin here might as well be royalty, their upbringing was so different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>No wonder she ends up butting heads with everyone around her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The kinds of things we could afford to laugh off or fool around with, she never could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Guess that explains why she always works so dang hard. Slacking off and taking things for granted just wasn't an option where she came from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>So...what're we gonna do, Magnus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Fun doesn't keep you fed, now does it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>We'll show her that life is about more than just survival.</td>
