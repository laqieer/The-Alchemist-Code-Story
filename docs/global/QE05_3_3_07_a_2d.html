<td>There's a town south of here, built around an oasis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Take them there. It's an emergency refuge for my guild.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Very well. What will you do?</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We can't afford to leave the Jam here. It will only serve to make Ceclidis more powerful in the long run. That's how it goes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Jam are basically masses of corruption. Without proper protection and gear, they can be quite tricky to deal with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Leave it to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It shall be done. Don't overdo it, now.</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Right.</td>

<td>Logi, I want you to stay with Agatha.</td>

<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's likely that Ceclidis is targeting her. You must protect her no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I understand. Let's go, Agatha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>O-okay. Mr. Kamui, Miss Tina... Please be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Have you ever fought the Jam before, Tina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Unfortunately, yes. Too many.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Then I guess you won't be needing my advice. I'll go ahead and intercept them, so that you can sneak up behind them and catch them by surprise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Got it. Geez, I can't believe I have to fight the Jam in the desert of all places! Fate is so ridiculous.</td>
