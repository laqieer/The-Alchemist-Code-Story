<td>The Doktor flips through his clipboard, nodding to himself in the stilted silence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>By my calculations, there should not be any...ah...disruptions to your bodies from the 'pulse'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I have dispatched ground technicians to ascertain its...exact nature, but in the meantime, you are to be discharged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Neither of your symbiotic links—that is, Paimon and Astaroth—appear to be worse for wear...which is most heartening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That little thing shouldn't be able to knock us out like that. The sooner we figure out why, the better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>My best guess is that she possesses an aura capable of disrupting the natural flow of Alchemia in a specific frequency—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh. That could get messy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Tch... Of all the things to complicate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Y-Yes. In any case, I would suggest that you continue to monitor your...your condition for the time being, and that of Astaroth's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It would help in isolating the symptoms and...and aid in my research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...All right. The Director will be expecting success.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Now if you'll excuse me, I have my own report to make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Would it kill him to take that attitude down a notch?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I swear, one day I should...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The Doktor peers around for any snooping attendants, then lowers his voice to a whisper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Eliza.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The flare should...should not have escaped the cryotube, from what I know of the design.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Did you notice if its facade was cracked?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I wouldn't be surprised if it was, given how wildly Subject VI was swinging that sword around...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Speaking of which, we've yet to find her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Useless dimwits. At this rate, that Li Wang is going to climb all over our heads...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I believe the Director will be much more concerned about Lachesis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You and Grimm may have emerged unscathed, but there is no telling how much more powerful the pulse could have been.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You think she will pose a danger to the living weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>They are not infallible, Eliza. And as a host, if the weapon fails to function...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...I know I live on borrowed time, Father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But it isn't mine to spend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Get some rest, my dear. The Director should be expecting you soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>A few days later, in a shadowed room somewhere in the Goetia headquarters...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>A frigid silence permeates the room, punctuated by the crisp flips of a report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I trust you are both recovered. I have received the Doktor's report, and will need you operationally ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Of course, Director. Shall I retrieve what they stole from us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No. Until such time as we are able to determine the extent of Lachesis's Alchemia disruption, you would be wise to keep your distance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Li Wang, move forward with the assessment of the Atropos Core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I expect its functionalities to be restored while we perfect its new homunculus shell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We have already observed favorable progress with Subject R; it will not be long before it is ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The Doktor has been notified and will be assisting you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It would be my pleasure, Director. I won't let a disgraced, fallen noble bar our way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We have enough of his data logs to recreate the experiments all the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I guarantee it will be far more successful than the events of late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The drug regimen is not to blame for Subject VI's anomalous behavior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh? And what about that other one—what do you call her, Godslayer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>She, like all of us here, owes a debt of gratitude to Goetia for our new lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Fail to live up to expectations and she pays the price with blood. You didn't think that collar was for show, did you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I disagree. Never trusted her gamboling ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Godslayer has proven her worth on several occasions. And Belial resonates well with her; absent our ministrations she would struggle to control the entity, much less wield it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...As you say, Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Eliza, continue the search for Lachesis, but do not engage. We will want to keep track of their movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes, Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>As for Subject VI...Grimm I, you are to dispose of her on sight and retrieve Berith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Dismissed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Meanwhile, at the Lustberg borders...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>There she is! Don't let her get away, or it'll be your head on the block!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yes sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>How persistent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I have to make it over the next hill, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>With any luck, Professor Minerva and the rest will be waiting there.</td>
