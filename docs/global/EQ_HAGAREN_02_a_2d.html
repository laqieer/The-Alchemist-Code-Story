<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fa_mast.png" alt="Roy Mustang" height="128"><br>Roy Mustang</td>

<td>Fire strong enough to blow a door to smithereens and a living, walking, talking suit of armor... The alchemy I've seen you lot use is really out of this world!</td>

<td>I will take that under consideration in the future, if you think it would prove effective.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fa_mast.png" alt="Roy Mustang" height="128"><br>Roy Mustang</td>
<td>This is hardly ideal. If only our souls were summoned, then what happened to our real bodies back in Amestris? Not to mention our minds! Would we even remain functional?</td>
</tr>

<td>Furthermore, if our worlds were to be joined together, I can hardly see it working toward our mutual benefit so much as to line this world's pockets, so to speak.</td>

<td>Was my brother one of the people you summoned? His name is Edward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Whoa. His name sounds a lot like mine. You could always give me the big brother treatment, Alphonse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fa_alph.png" alt="Alphonse" height="128"><br>Alphonse</td>
<td>Um... Thank you for the offer, but I think I'll be okay.</td>

<td>Ed?!</td>

<td>I agree. The question is, who is that and what are they after?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>No need to pile on! Just one look at that guy and it's clear he's not one of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fa_mast.png" alt="Roy Mustang" height="128"><br>Roy Mustang</td>
<td>Your instincts aren't half bad. I'm sure you must have figured out how dangerous he is, too. This isn't your fight anymore. You should escape while you still can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>No, it's too late. I'm already a part of this. I'm not the kind of guy who would leave his friends behind!</td>
