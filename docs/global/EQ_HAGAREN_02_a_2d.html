<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I apologize for the misunderstanding, Colonel Mustang, Lieutenant Hawkeye. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You, too, Suit of Ar... Uh, Alphonse, right? Wow. People from other worlds really do come in all shapes and sizes... Anyway, welcome to the Continent of Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Thanks, Ed...gar. It's nice to finally meet someone friendly here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hmm... I expect this gorgeous lady over here isn't very talkative. She does seem like the aloof type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Don't you feel even a little bad for them, General Toritoh? You did put them in this mess, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No. My sympathy is hardly requisite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Sure, but if you're cool-headed enough to spout off words like that, couldn't you have just talked things through with them? Why break the ice with violence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Per...haps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmph. Well, now we've all had a little breather, it's time for you to start answering some of my questions, Toritoh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Let's start with how you called us "Phantoms". What do you know about human transmutation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Paladins don't give in under duressâ€”but if that's all you want to know, then I am not opposed to answering. However, are you certain that you want me to answer that question?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We've had nothing but bad experiences with human transmutation. It's only natural to be wary of those willing to carry it out so casually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>First of all, the words "human transmutation" aren't quite applicable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Our alchemy draws forth the strength of heroes from other eras, allowing us to borrow their power by summoning their souls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Phantoms gain physical forms as part of the summoning process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The age and appearance of a Phantom is dependent upon their soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This process is quite different from the alchemy used in your world to bring someone back from the dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>In other words, the result is similar, but the approach is different. Interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Many things are possible within the theory of alchemy, creating a plethora of techniques...such as Phantoms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>My duty as a Paladin is to safeguard alchemy. As such, I mourn the fact that Phantoms are most commonly used as tools of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No matter the time or place, it seems that alchemy will always be used as a weapon wherever applicable. Hmph. That must seem ironic, coming from a Phantom like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>There are...extenuating circumstances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Why am I not surprised? After all, they did put a lot of effort into bringing you here from a different world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Fire strong enough to blow a door to smithereens and a living, walking, talking suit of armor... The alchemy I've seen you lot use is really out of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The Holy Order is willing to sacrifice a great deal to get their hands on something from your world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The plan is to create a Dimensional Gate that will connect our two worlds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I have been granted the privilege of taking part in this endeavor as the Blessed One of the Holy Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huh. I figured you'd be more like the stubborn, silent type, but it seems like you actually have quite a lot to say about alchemy and the Holy Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It is my responsibility as the Blessed One to learn of the role the Holy Order has played throughout history, and to understand its current place to better embody its will in the present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Blessed One? You don't sound very happy to have such a lofty position. Come on, show a bit more enthusiasm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I will take that under consideration in the future, if you think it would prove effective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Effective? That's not... Never mind. It's not important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>A Dimensional Gate, huh...? That's way over my head...even if you are all here, right before my eyes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This is hardly ideal. If only our souls were summoned, then what happened to our real bodies back in Amestris? Not to mention our minds! Would we even remain functional?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Furthermore, if our worlds were to be joined together, I can hardly see it working toward our mutual benefit so much as to line this world's pockets, so to speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Miss Toritoh, can I ask you something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm guessing you must've summoned others as well, not just the three of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Was my brother one of the people you summoned? His name is Edward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Whoa. His name sounds a lot like mine. You could always give me the big brother treatment, Alphonse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Um... Thank you for the offer, but I think I'll be okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Edward... That sounds familiar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hey! Who're you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ed?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Oh, yes. He, too, is named Edward. He has been assisting us. I suppose he must have come to escort me back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Our progress on the Dimensional Gate is largely thanks to this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>No, that's not him! Whoever that is, my brother isn't inside that body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I agree. The question is, who is that and what are they after?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>No need to pile on! Just one look at that guy and it's clear he's not one of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Your instincts aren't half bad. I'm sure you must have figured out how dangerous he is, too. This isn't your fight anymore. You should escape while you still can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>No, it's too late. I'm already a part of this. I'm not the kind of guy who would leave his friends behind!</td>
</tr>
