<td>Hyaaaah!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Gyaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Phew… They outnumbered us but we took care of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Glad that we're not too far from the city. Seems like these people can get to the city without our help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes. Is everyone alright? Any injuries?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ow! I'm bleeding…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh? Oh…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Y-you're no human… with that power…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You... What have you done, you monster?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>U-um… I'll be leaving now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wait, Cordelia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Cordelia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh… Tethys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Sorry to rush off so quickly…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I don't mind that, but what happened back there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well…I…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I got a little scared. I thought they were going to call me a monster…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>A monster? Why would they say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Being locked indoors for so long, I realized I was being called that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Being weak against bright sunlight, it was like a vampire's lifestyle. Even though I'm a normal human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What's more, people made rumors that I was a vampire. When I fought back against them, I was further treated as a monster…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Just now, it made me recall that time…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You were treated like that by everyone around you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No. My mother didn't. The housemaid who took care of me and her child, also a girl who was my friend…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There were some people who understood me and were friendly with me. But most people would have the urge to kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>So I got scared. Those people might've gotten scared of me and who knows…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But…you're trying to make bonds with other people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well, yes, I do. Weird, right? Even though I'm scared of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I know it's a terrible habit. I'm cautious of what others think of me, so I tried to avoid people…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>My mother, my friend who used to help me, and Alyu…used to treat me as a normal person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I don't want to be hurt, so I treat people like that as if they don't exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Before I became a Phantom Soldier, I might not have thought about it, but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I am a soldier now, and the times that I was called a vampire is in the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>And so, by proving my merit in this situation, I thought I could put it all behind me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I don't want to avoid people anymore and I want to make bonds by approaching others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But…all those memories came flooding back..</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm making an effort, but it's no good by getting scared again. Maybe I have no choice but to give up…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh, I'm sorry for talking about all this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We were able to save those people, so we should get moving. We have to make sure the costume parade can continue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Cordelia…</td>
