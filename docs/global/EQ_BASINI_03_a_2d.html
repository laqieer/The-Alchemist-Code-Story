<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Irene of Corpse, reporting in. I have spoken with Lord Commander Basheeny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Subsequently I have personally confirmed that he remains unable to wield the power of Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I have concluded that he is superfluous to the preservation of order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I see... Good work, Irene. Then I have another mission for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You are to eliminate Lord Commander Basheeny and recover Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So you believe him not only superfluous, but dangerous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Surely you are not questioning my orders. Perhaps you do not believe you can kill him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Of course not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Good. Most likely, Basheeny will not step down as Lord Commander of his own volition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If order is to be maintained, we must give him a push as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If he is not a threat, why is it so urgent that we eliminate him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Currently, Excalibur harbors power enough within its blade to turn the world upside down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>If a naive Lord Commander were to misuse that power...they could plunge Babel into chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What does that...mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>There is a particular ritual that is performed when Excalibur is passed from an old wielder to a new one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What kind of ritual?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh, the ceremony itself is of no import. It is the feelings burning in the heart of the Lord Commander, and the rest of those present, that truly matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Their desire for peace flows into Excalibur itself, to crystallize within the blade in the form of pure compassion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I am sure you can imagine what that power is capable of, if released.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The power of compassion that lies within Excalibur was left behind by Emmel, the founder of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If Basheeny were to unleash it, then this world would descend into chaos. We must act before he learns how to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I want you to lure him into contact with forbidden knowledge, then use that pretext to eliminate him. Can I trust you with this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>As you wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Pain, sorrow, hesitation, and doubt mean nothing before the absolution of order, was it? A fine philosophy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Very well. I will continue to rely on you, so long as you continue to serve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Human resolve is the root of chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>My earliest memories are of the Arena in Gluttony Foss...where I served as a test subject for a certain research organization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Sometimes they made me fight humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Sometimes they made me fight monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Once each battle was over, they would inject my body with magical energy. "Enhancement," they called it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The power was too great for my small frame to contain, but my screams fell on deaf ears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>No resolve drove me. I grew stronger because they wished it, fought because they asked it, and suffered afterwards because they demanded it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But, all that time, there was one who stayed by my side:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>My fellow subject, a great bird. Like me, his body had been warped by our captors' depraved desires in pursuit of power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I named him "Carlotta," meaning "freedom".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>My reason was simple: I hoped someday he would take wing and fly free.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Eventually, my captors grew dissatisfied with just magical energy and began experimenting with Philosopher's Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The Arena was nothing more than a front for their experiments, hidden in the dark underbelly of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>My voice reached no one when I screamed, at the mercy of their twisted resolve. That was when I knew resolve to be corrosive to a just and ordered world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>But I refused to be like them. I would not become a monster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>If resolve could drive humans to such atrocities, I was better off without it, and so I cast it away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>One day, everything changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>The Inquisitors of the Holy Order caught wind of my captors' illicit alchemy and raided the laboratory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>At last, we were saved...by a group named Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>My captors masqueraded as a legitimate organization, but that did not earn them the luxury of a trial. Only we, their subjects, were spared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>After that, Carlotta and I fell into the care of the Holy Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>It was not long before the two of us joined Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I felt no reservations. I had seen for myself that some evils lurked where the light of day could not touch them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>And so it was to Corpse, which preserved order from the shadows, that I chose to lend my powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>That is the story of my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>To those whose resolve would plunge the world into chaos...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I offer only the mercy that the edge of a blade can afford.</td>
</tr>
