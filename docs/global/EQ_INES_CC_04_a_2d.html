<td>Do this here, and then that, and then finally say the prayer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That is right, isn't it? Hey, Nasario? Are you okay? Is this the right order?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It should be fine. Although...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Your back is hunched. As a high elf, you should never present yourself in such an unsightly posture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sheesh, okay, I get it! So...you're saying everything else was good, then? Spare me your nitpicks; I want to know how I'm doing overall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oho. Getting a bit impatient, are we? Remember, these "nitpicks" are very important. The high elf representative must be prudent, and have a tremendous eye for detail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Fine, fine! Don't worry, that's totally me! Let me give it another try. Watch me closely this time, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Perhaps you should wait. Take a small break. You don't need to repeat this so many times. The flow of the festival is already within you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But there's nothing else to do! Claris told us not to stray from our lodgings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Though I suppose she also hasn't come to see us in quite some time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Nothing to do? What of that old adage: early to bed, early to rise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What are you suggesting? That we turn in already? Are you so tired of my voice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Certainly not. It was merely a suggestion. At any rate, what would you do if Claris did come to see us now? What would you say to her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I guess...we'd just have a friendly chat, wouldn't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh? And what do you surmise you would talk about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>About her, first of all. I've never met a human like her before. I'm very curious to learn more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And that's precisely why I can't leave you to your own devices here. You shouldn't let your guard down so easily around themâ€”any of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You are aware, are you not, just how rampant high elf hunting is in other countries?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Even if we have a relatively cordial relationship with the humans of this kingdom, don't forget that our people still suffer at the hands of humans every day, all across the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You, especially, should know this fact well, given your own experiences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I...can't deny what you're saying, but...still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Nasario, do you think that Claris is a bad person?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>She is considerably more knowledgeable about our culture and history than most other humans. On top of which, she has earned the favor of the spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Add to that her passion for the duty she's undertaken...and I would say it is fair to assess her as one of the more upstanding among her kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Th-there you go! So, what's the problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The problem is, we don't know what she's really thinking. We don't even know what she's doing right now. She is keeping us, metaphorically, in the dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>All right. Fine! I can concede that point. We don't know the first thing about Claris just yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>She could be an awful person deep down, just like those others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But...I really want to believe that she's not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The mere thought that she could be terrifies me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...You squeeze it so tightly in times like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You have magic crystals for protection, yet you persist in relying upon that pressed flower charm of yours. It must mean a great deal to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yeah. It does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>All right. If you'll stay here, I'll go and search for her in your place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I suspected the possibility of trouble, which is why I sent out the call for guards from our village before we left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Please, protect Ines while I'm away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But, will you be okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Do not fret. It will affect your ability to concentrate when the time comes. I'll be back soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Off he goes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I sure hope he'll be all right.</td>
