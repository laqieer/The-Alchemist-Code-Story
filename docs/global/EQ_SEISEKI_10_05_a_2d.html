<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hang in there! Don't lose faith!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh...how are...m-my people of the...water tribes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's all right! There haven't been any further casualties! The damage has been stemmed to the minimum!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What a...relief...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So-someone, tend to her! Hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't worry. I told you I wouldn't kill the Sprites, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Besides, she's a woman. I went a little easy on her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Tsk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Still, I've finally obtained the third one. These Matters really are a lot of trouble to deal with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Honestly. You should be a little more grateful, redhead. I followed your request and kept casualties to a minimum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>In any case...this may not necessarily be the end of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What are you planning next?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Why don't you ask her instead? Bang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ughhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It appears she was setting a trap. Here I was, ready to end things peacefully...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It can't be! Voda obediently surrendered...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No...it's not that woman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Aghhh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Uck...ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You're...Seida's acquaintance...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You're the one who's been tailing us since we left the settlement of that battle faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And you're the one who riled up this tribe, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The Ma-Matters are sacred crystals that are integral to Saga! They aren't some little toy for the likes of you to play with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You're all losers...with no place in the future of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And, as a loser, you have no right to an opinion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Y-you don't understand the repercussions of misusing the Matter! You don't understand anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>They may very well be related to the ancient dragon that has been prophesied to destroy this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The ancient dragon...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Are you telling me that this Matter might summon that dragon? Hehe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Tsk! What's so funny?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Haha. How splendid! A dragon would be quite incredible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You've renewed my interest in gathering the Matters. I look forward to seeing it with my own eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>However...if that dragon was to become an obstacle for us, then that would change matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I don't know what it signifies to you, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If it stands in my way, I'll blow its head off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Come on. Let's go, redhead. Heheh. We may get to meet a legendary dragon, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I-I promise I'll make you regret this! You and all your friends! All of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Th-the cries of pain from my dead tribesmen call out to me...spurring me forward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>A-all of you...I promise...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...Now, why would you say such a thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It contradicts my philosophy to kill a woman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>However, if you're going to make my friends your target, you leave me with no choice but to kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...! Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>N-no! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It's too late. It's in a tribe's nature to try and weed out whoever it is that threatens their people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Boar Tackle!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Uck...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>He fell for it! Now!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Are those...the people from the water faction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Come on! With that bow...we'll avenge all those who've died!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Well...who would've thought you'd set a trap like this? Quite cunning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...?! Wait, people of the Voda faction! It's still not deep enough...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...Too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Aghhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Ho-how...could you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Sorry. I didn't want to kill them either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It's your fault for letting your mouth run wild, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Wh...whaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>But...as the leader, it's not right for me to break a promise. Will you forgive me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Sto...stop!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hmm. You're quite the looker, but...you're not very popular with the ladies, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Agh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I wouldn't call myself a feminist, but, you know...you've gotta treat women with respect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Ca-Captain Othima!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...!</td>
