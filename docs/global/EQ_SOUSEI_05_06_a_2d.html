<td>The vanguard has made it ashore! We'll create a foothold for the troops that follow us! Go, go, go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's just like they said, no one noticed us! Look, not a single guard got dispatched to hinder us—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...Hold on, there's...not a single... That's weird, this city is supposed to be highly populated, where the heck is anybody—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>"The fish have taken the bait!" I repeat: "the fish have taken the bait!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I think you've got it all wrong. It's fine to be scared of the Cursed Beasts. All of us are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's just—we have to fight. We must fight. It's the only choice we've got.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So please don't worry. If you wish for it to, I'm sure the shield will respond to your call.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You really think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Of course I do. I'm proud of you, my knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You should do things your own way. The right answer isn't going to fall down from the sky if you just wait for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You've gotta pick your own ideals, accept yourself, and figure out the right answer yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>An answer that you can be proud of. One that you can fight for without regrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(My own reason to fight...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're not just protecting cargo! Think of the smiles and happiness of the citizens all over our country. I know you can do it if you just think of it that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>When you put it that way... Yes, I love this place and its people. I want everyone who lives here to be able to laugh their days away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I will protect them! Their peaceful daily lives, their happiness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That is why I was picked by this shield! And that's something I can be proud of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Everyone prepare for combat! Purple Flame Knights Shield Regimen, it is time we protect this city!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Everyone, follow me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We'll bring up the rear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Th-that technique is—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>All the magil in this atmosphere is now ours to control. I'm sorry, but we're not planning to let you go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Emmel, please look after the wounded behind us! Oh, and if you could throw a bit of Spiritbonding our way—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hurray! What wonderful visitors!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Good, we're in control of this battle—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>—Incoming! A bombardment from the ocean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Those slippery snakes! They're opening fire while they're still concealed! Don't think I'm going to let such a low trick slide!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Don't get any closer! Our Time-Space Manipulation won't reach that far... We'll have to leave it to Nimul and the rest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I know that, but—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Fire! Keeping firing! Those bastards can't even see what's hitting them! Remain in the open waters and keep firing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh...? There's a shadow on the deck—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Wh-what is that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We've arrived above the enemy fleet! Hehe, thought you could let your guard down, didn'tcha? Look at those flabbergasted faces, haha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This must be a vessel made with the latest magil research. It's pretty impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We were planning to fight the enemy at sea... I never thought we'd be doing it from the skies...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm glad they didn't notice us earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>They were prepared to fight the Invidia Belt, and them alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>They never even thought about paying attention to the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We'll be able to land on the deck soon. Imnus, are your troops ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We're in formation. The Purple Flame Knights Sword Regimen is ready to go any time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I fear I'm still not that good at the wind technique we're using as a buffer though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'll help out with alchemy this time, so it shouldn't be a problem. You can jump without a worry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yup, don't worry about a thing! I'll be helping too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Well then, guess we're all good to go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What?! Invidia Belt soldiers are falling from the sky?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>We still have the numerical advantage! We just got to cut 'em down as they drop—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Sorry to disappoint, but the sky ambush was just the beginning! The real thing starts here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I've arrived at the ship! Time for the diversion! Knights of Invidia, attend to my location!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's the captain's signal! All Purple Flame Knights and commercial vessels, charge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Their ships are headed straight for us?!  W-we have to strike back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>B-but! At this rate they're going to charge right into our flank!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Then...perhaps... Those people... Let us make sacrifices of the people who they care so much about...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>B-but that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Splendid... They jabbed through what we in our pride relied too much upon and turned the battle around in an instant...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Tell the troops to make land. We will make our battlefield with their land under our feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Y-yes, sir! But what about the enemy attacking our ships?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I will crush them... Me and the most splendid of my soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Wh-wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Show them our wrath. Bellow your ire! This is the time to make the world witness our vice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Excellent, if we just keep pushing—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Wait! Something doesn't feel right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>This air... Is that corruption?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Be careful, everyone! Something's coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Waaaaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Found you, general—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>A Fallen?! Is it controlling those armored knights?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Nrk... Here he comes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Give in to sin!</td>
