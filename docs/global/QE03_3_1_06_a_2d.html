<td>I don't think...that sacrifice is a part of love.</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>What?</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There's something wrong with this country! Loving someone is supposed to add to that person's life, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yet, in this country, sacrifice is a part of love. That's not adding that's subtracting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Whether that's wrong or not, that is this country's fate.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The curse that the abominable witch left...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>To protect myself and this country from that curse, these people die, yet continue to be a part of me...that is love in this country.</td>

<td>If you are one of my citizens, then before you bring about disaster, it would be best if you died for all of us!</td>

<td>If you think those shadows that surround you is "love," then, Your Highness...do you really love those people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Of course, I do. It's the queen's duty to love her people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Then why did those people die?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If love protects you and this country, why did the mages that you love have to die! It doesn't make sense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>They are still alive, are they not? They live within me! That is the ultimate form of loveâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>How can someone who kills her own body be capable of love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>How dare you deny your queen's love!</td>
