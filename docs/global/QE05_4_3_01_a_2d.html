<td>Kamui. It is a pleasure to see you again.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>How are things progressing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The Liberation Army is here, and virtually in full force at that. They've set up camp outside the port.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It appears that the guards of the royal capital were not expecting us. They have been scrambling to respond, clearly unprepared for an attack at this point in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Now that we're all here, let us take the main road. On to the royal capital!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Blue Tongues, reporting for duty, sir! We have finished disembarkation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Good! Then we're ready. Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I guess this is where we part ways. I promise to keep Agatha and Marie safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Logi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'll join you soon, Agatha. Please, be safe until then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Let us go, then. It's time to bring the fight to our enemies! To the royal capital!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wow! Despite the number of people here, we're really making good time! In Saga, even with just half the number, with sheep it took much longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This road between the port and the royal capital is where the bulk of commerce happens in Gluttony Foss. For that reason, it has been well maintained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I had hoped that would mean that we would be able to make good enough time to make inroads into the city before they had formed their defensive lines, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It seems that was a vain hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Troops! At arms! It is our duty to protect the royal capital!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Defend the city, or your worthless hides will be out of a job!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This seems like it could become quite a mess. Regardless, we cannot let them stop us here. We must break through their ranks and into the royal capital!</td>
