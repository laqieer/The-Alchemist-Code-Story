<td>Your blade is rigid... Inflexible. So... You still believe that the path you have chosen is the only means of salvation?</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>Not in the mood to answer? Perhaps this will loosen your—</td>

<td>This tremor... The dragon is on the move?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It is time.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hold it! You intend to flee?</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I have seen right through you. You are not good enough to hinder me.</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Surely you have realized it by now... You don't have what it takes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Regardless of how impressive the arms you forge, and how much you improve your sword skills... You will never reach the Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I forge weapons. Nothing more, nothing less. One day, these hands will create a blade capable of destroying a God. That is, after all, why my life was spared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Know this... The next time we meet, you will draw your last breath, and you will die as the final quester of the Avarice Belt Region.</td>

<td>Nimul needs me. I had best hurry.</td>

<td>016</td>
<td>Warning. Extensive turbulence has been detected. Immediate change of route is required. Repeat, immediate—</td>

<td>Aaaaahhh!</td>

<td>018</td>
<td>Lady Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Th-thank you, Julia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We don't have time to stand on ceremony, my lady. What are we going to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You're right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I think...the Great Nidhogg is taking flight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This is bad. Nimul and the others are still in the dragon's interior!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hrrghh! No! The Matter isn't responding! I can't do anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Aaahh! L-look! Fallen are...emerging from inside the Guardian Dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Uuuuuuhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No! They're going to damage the airship!</td>

<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Leave it to me, my lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Uuhhhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>From your garb and equipment, I can see that you must have once been warriors of note.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>However... Your attacks are no longer as skilled as they once were, and I cannot feel a hint of the burnished light of the Sephira from within you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I suppose...such is the fate of one who has fallen to the corruption of sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Haaaaaaaaarrrhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>And for you to attack the Vessel of Purification, even though you should be prepared to risk your own life for her sake...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Truly, not a single shred of the pride of the Sephira people remains within you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Therefore, it is up to those of us who came after to show you the error of your ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Pray, prepare yourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Now that Sephiron's protection has receded, I felt it necessary to employ a little trick of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You see... I used a technique that allows me to imbue my gear with Sephirium, thereby strengthening the blessing of the great tree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I am aware that Yna was able to succeed at this on his own, but a similar technique is known to those of us in the Sephira Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Now, please... Stand back, my lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I will be the one to correct the misconduct of these fallen warriors of the Sephira, as their fellow—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Julia! I can fight, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Very well. I ask only that you do not push yourself too far, my lady. There is only so much I can do to protect you when you are fighting by my side.</td>
