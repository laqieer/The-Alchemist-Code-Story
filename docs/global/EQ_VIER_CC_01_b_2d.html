<td>It has been so long since I've dreamed of anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(I haven't been able to sleep well enough to dream lately.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Let us take in the night air.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Silently... Just like all the rest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>In this frozen time, there are none to hear the sounds of chilled wind, the snow crunching underfoot, or the screams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Let sleep come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Quietly and comfortably, until the end...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>One set of footfalls. One cry, raised in the silence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>A horrible dream that should never come true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I can't sleep. Not even here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ephylinde?! Ephylinde, where are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Princess Ainanna...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Where have you gone?! Ephylinde?! Please, no! Where are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Princess Ainanna?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ephylinde! There you are! Thank goodness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Is everything all right, Your Highness? Why are you out so late?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You weren't in your bedroom, so... Hehehehe, I just got so scared. I thought you left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Rest assured, Your Highness. I am here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Besides, you have both the King and Queen, your parents, with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I...can no longer rely on my parents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I can't sleep, Ephylinde.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What is the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I had a nightmare. I was alone, screaming among swarming insects...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I've been having this same dream night after night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The village I worked so hard to protect...burned and lost. There, I'm alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There is no one there... I'm all alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ephylinde...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I, too, had a nightmare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You did as well, Ephylinde?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Insomnia is difficult, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I had hoped something would change with you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I honestly believed I would be able to have pleasant dreams...but I can't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I saw the end of a nation blanketed in snow. I was frightened by the thought of spring approaching. I shivered at the prospect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ephylinde...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes. I am here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Mmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I shall remain like this till we lull into sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Just...don't...go.</td>
