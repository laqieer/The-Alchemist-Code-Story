<td>Well... I don't think you can! Because I won't let you!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How dare you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>How could you... To Emmel...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>How? Why? Well...Nimul, let me just ask you a simple question. Maybe that'll make things a bit clearer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>When you say you're going to save "everything and everyone"...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Am I included in that list?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'll kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(...No.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'll kill you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(That's...not right.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Anyone who lays a hand on Emmel will die by my hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(It was...supposed to be different...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This...isn't what I wanted, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Fine, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Then I'll change it! You say this is just the way things are? That this is how things have to be? Well, maybe so, but that just means they need to be changed, so I'm gonna change 'em!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Really, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I promise! I'm going to grow stronger—even more powerful than the village elder! I'm going to make a world where nobody ever needs to be sacrificed! Where we won't need any more Vessels!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's my dream, okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Change the world? Nimul, sometimes I can't believe the stuff that comes out of your mouth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But...thank you for saying that, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's what my little sister said to me, with a smile on her face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Seeing that, I learned for the first time what she looked like when she was genuinely happy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That the thing she needed to be happy from the bottom of her heart was this great undertaking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I had to make that overly ambitious childlike dream of mine come true. Otherwise, she would never truly be saved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>And so, there was only one thing to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I had to change the world. That would quickly become my reason for living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...! Gggh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmm? Finally, it's calmed down...a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Nnnf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No... I can't... This can't go on...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This power was never meant for humans. Humans lack any means of controlling it. It's a forbidden power, intended strictly for gods to wield...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Nngh, gnrk... If this continues, then all the regions...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No. That cannot be allowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What have I been fighting for all my life? To save everyone! Right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Then that's what I must do now! Save the world, save all the regions, save all the people who live within them... And...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Fulfill that selfish, childish, blustery promise I once made.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(That's what I've been working so hard for all this time, after all. Right?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well... I don't think you can! Because I won't let you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Emmel...is fine. With Eulalia on her side, she must be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>So... I should still...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(I mustn't allow this world to be destroyed.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(But then what do I do? With the cores combined, it's not like I can control this light...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(At best, I can suppress it, but even then, this stone converts its surroundings into magil and consumes them, no matter how hard I try to hold it at bay.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Nrk... Haaa... Hnng...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>This is the power...of the Cursed Beasts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(Though the only thing that's different from what I'm used to is the nature of the magil being controlled...which means...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I might be able to seal it, if I'm lucky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>There's an altar here that looks just like the one in Sephiron. So let's give it a shot. Fingers crossed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ha...aaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ngh... Even walking is...incredibly painful. I don't think I've ever felt pain like this before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But...I can't...give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(It hurts, but I can withstand it. I just have to get out of the city, and then—)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Ah... It's been a long time since my heart hurt this much. Not since I learned I wouldn't be able to become the Vessel of Purification myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(If I could have, I would have happily taken her place.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I wish I could have been a better brother to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What?! You're... What are you all doing here? You should get away...quickly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What...? What are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>(What am I saying? It's obvious they've come out to defend themselves and all the things—and people—they hold most dear. Just as I would.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Please! Don't come any closer! If you do... Mrng, just get away, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hahahahahahahahahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Wh—? Why are you laughing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Finally! Our time has come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It's our turn at last! Welcome, Nimul, Child of God! Welcome, savior!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Deliver us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What?!</td>
