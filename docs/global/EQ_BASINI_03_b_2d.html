<td>The 'Infinite Serpent'...</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>(This new tipoff doesn't match anything in Lord Zain's notes. Which means, in all likelihood...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I've stumbled into a trap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This will be enough of a pretext for Corpse. Irene will come to eliminate me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And the Holy Order—and Waginau—will claim the blade Commander Kanon entrusted me with: Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Orion led the Lion Monarch's Charge, but Waginau was the one pulling the strings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>He planned to use Orion as a vessel to resurrect Nimul, but he failed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That must be it, then. It isn't my life that Waginau wants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>He still hasn't given up on resurrecting Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And now, the Holy Guard is too weak to defend Excalibur...and so am I.</td>

<td>The future has been left in our hands. We have to prove that we can handle that responsibility.</td>

<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm gonna be the one who protects the peace of Babel, and don't you forget it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's our duty to build the peaceful future our captains hoped for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Don't worry. We will tend to the flames you've lit within us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(I have to fulfill my oath.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I have to honor their trust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But how?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Pain, sorrow, hesitation, doubt... They mean nothing before the absolution of order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>

<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Perhaps you were right, Irene.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I've felt the warmth of sunlight and the bonds of friendship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I've learned to hold those things dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I've been entrusted with that same resolve you're so convinced will bring chaos, and I care about it more than anything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I've chosen my path. I don't have any need for doubts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Disappointing. I didn't take you for a deserter.</td>

<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I can't say I blame you for running away, given the circumstances...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But as Lord Commander, you couldn't have made a more foolish choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>In the name of preserving the balance of this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I, Irene of Corpse, sentence you to die.</td>
