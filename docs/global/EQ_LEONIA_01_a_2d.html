<td>Right... In that case, I shall be your very first fan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Even when alone, so long as someone is there to see you shine, you're a star!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Now, keep that chin up! Be proud of your starry shine! For, one day, you'll find your very own glow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I wonder how my teacher's doing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Is something the matter, Shayna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No... It's nothing. Um... What was it you needed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm here about that job you wanted done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, right! For the time being, I'd like you to be my bodyguard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There are loads of people who will come at me and try to challenge me to a test of strength. Normally, I would just take them on, but like...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The theme of this event is Getting Cuter With Discipline! So I think fighting should totally be avoided, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I see. And these are the people from whom you wish to be protected?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yup! You're always surrounded by adoring fans, so I figured you must be a total pro at handling them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmhm. Indeed. Such is the life of the Pure White Lion of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I am used to drawing people's attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I knew I could count on you! You always respond to your fans super sincerely, no matter who they are, so I just know you'll treat my fans well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I totally didn't think you'd actually take on my request, though! Like, wow! Thanks so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I could never turn down someone who so desperately wished for my help. Besides, Envylia is experiencing a period of calm. I am not so needed as I once was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I have kept up my training, however, so it is highly unlikely that they will prove a challenge for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Whoo! That's what I'm talking about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>By the way, Leoniaz, what's with the get-up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This event involves mingling with the general public. I fear that I would look out of place in my knightly garb, and I certainly would not want to intimidate anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Of course, I had to make sure that my outfit was suitably elegant, so as not to detract from yours, Lady Shayna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That is how I came to select this piece. It is rather fetching, wouldn't you agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, yeah! Seeing you in this, I can totally see why you have so many fans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ahahah! I am honored to hear it, my lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>In any case, I suspect that we will have many guests to tend to at this Fan Club Event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yep! And we don't wanna startle anyone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Okay! We've gotta handle this ourselves! It can be our warm-up exercise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Then let us get to it, without further delay, and remember: we are strong, we are proud, and we are beautiful!</td>
