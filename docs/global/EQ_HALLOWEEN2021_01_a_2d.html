<td>Huff…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What am I doing here…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hurry! Hurry! Or we'll miss the candy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wait for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hey, where am I supposed to put this stuff?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Line it up over here. Also…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(Everyone seems to be having fun, but I don't want to be suspected of being a vampire and causing a fuss like before...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(Looks like a festival where children are the focus. Best to stay out of the way and not stand out.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Found ya! Here, have some!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hyahh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Th-this is…candy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>They're being handed out. It's Halloween candy. Pretty good stuff, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>R-Ramses? What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I didn't see you around even though this festival was happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>As I, Ramses, successor to the sun, was invited here to this event again…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…means that I have the obligation to make sure everyone is having fun! And that includes you too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>M-me too? But, this seems to be a festival for the city's children…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>My take on Halloween is that everyone no matter their age should be having fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Adults, children, phantom soldiers should equally be part of the event!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Equally…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Even though people have called me a monster, am I really to be included here…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's time to come with me and receive candy with smiles. Let's go, Coredlia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh…? W-wait a minute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If I…hand out candy, the people might get scared…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Scared? Of what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Um… Because…of what happened before…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That was then and this is now. Look at how you're treated by people now, compared to before. Things have changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If the environment changes, the people will also change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>In addition to that, I'm here to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ramses…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(He's accepting me for who I am without prejudice…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Well, you're right. I'll do my best then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's the spirit! I have an idea. Why not also invite Tethys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But I'm not good at this sort of thing…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>See, Tethys is saying she can't. Don't worry, we can play together instead, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No! I want Tethys to play with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What's going on over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ramses! Don't start running so suddenly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hey, Ramses and Cordelia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It seems there was an argument going on. And so I'm here to settle it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So, what seems to be the problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Okay, so this child wants to play together with Tethys…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I want Blanchett and Tethys to both play with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The two of them can play together. Just not me…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Why??? Let's play together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hm…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Alright, little girl. First, why don't you help me hand out some candy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hand out candy…? Sounds fun! But Tethys…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Sounds good! Tethys, when you're ready you can join us, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Well…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(I'm sorry…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(I won't be any fun for them, so I really shouldn't be joining…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>H-help! Someone help!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What the…? What was that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Someone's screaming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Rattys came and took our goods!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Numa! Numaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Are those the goods for the costume parade? Where are they taking them? We won't let them get away!</td>
