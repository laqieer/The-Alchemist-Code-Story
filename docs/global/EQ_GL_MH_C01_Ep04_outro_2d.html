<td>A short while after Siegfried's party leaves the ruins, two figures emerge from the nearby forest, having watched the situation unfold and resolve from afar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>After making sure the coast is clear, they head towards one of the underground entrances to the facility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>My Lord, it appears they were investigating this room in particular.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Then let us make haste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The taller figure regards the laboratory with mild interest while the slighter one surveys the debris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Anything of note?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The large Prototype has taken major damage. It doesn't seem to be functional any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What of the memory component?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Intact, my Lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Good. Salvage as much as of the rest as you can. I will have the scholars retrieve and analyze the data later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I am certain there will be much to glean from its encounter with those people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The taller figure leans against a pillar and begins to muse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The Professor… I suppose she was bound to show up sooner or later. Her former apprentices coming in search of her was unexpected, but that is fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>After all, the boy was with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Given how previous experiments with the Prototypes had failed to produce any sort of reaction, he may hold the key to unlocking these mysteries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The slight figure places a hand atop the large Construct in an attempt to dislodge its memory component. Its detectors suddenly blink for a moment, startling the figure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>As quickly as it happened, the Construct goes completely silent again, and the memory component clicks loose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hmm… It's almost as if it was sentient. Fascinating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I believe that will be all, for now. Contact the rest. We retire for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Certainly, my Lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The slight figure pockets the memory component and gathers up other small materials. The two scan the room one last time before leaving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>They disappear into the night, obscured by the falling darkness.</td>
