<td>Well, at least we made it out safely and didn't get thrown in jail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That would be scarier than the beasts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We can't go back there, though. Not unless we want to be caught again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Smiling mischievously, Minerva produces a small vial of crimson liquid from her bag.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Teacher, is that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A blood sample from the savage beasts. At the very least, we should be able to ascertain the level of Alchemia particles in their body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Minerva pulls out her supplies and begins her work. A small while later, her jewel begins to glow brightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Whoa, that can't be good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, my. This is comparable to the sample my colleague sent me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Given how savagely they were fighting before, I wouldn't be surprised if some of their blood managed to seep into the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Definitely not contamination from the samples, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That squad that marched us out... Seemed a bit too well-prepared and excessive for a patrol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's too much of a coincidence for them to be there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Those guards are definitely aware of what's going on in the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What should we do now? I think we observed all we could back there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If the squad's there for a reason, now's our best time to check out what they're up to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I agree. Sundown's in about half an hour. I don't think they'll be expecting us again quite so soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Fairly said. Shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Everyone ready? It's probably going to get dark out real quick, but we can't use lights or they'll see us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Stay close and be extra careful where you step.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>OW!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Idiot! I told you to move quickly, not clumsily!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...! Did you hear that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yeah. Move over a little. Watch it, don't fall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(Hehe... It's so comfortable leaning on Sieg.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well, if it isn't our dear Captain from before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ugh. What a nasty dent. This better not be damaged...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hurry up, we're late. The rest of you, make sure no one is following us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Aye sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I wonder what's in the boxes. Looks... heavy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Guess we'll have to find out. But first, let's take care of the guys bringing up the rear.</td>
