<td>001</td>
<td>Nnnghh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Where...am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I remember we were all caught up in the awakening of the Cursed Beasts, and then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Nimul? Where are you?! Is anyone...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We were wondering what uninvited guest had just come into our home and made a mess, and what do we find but a survivor of Gluttony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Survived? Hmm... Perhaps flushed out would be more accurate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You abandoned the village, and now you flounder for life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I understand now, looking at you. Humans do not give up easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I remember you! You were the one who—!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I have no idea of what you speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>However, you must leave, human. This is my domain. All the ways about here belong to me..</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Only those whom I allow may stay here. For my way is the only one that exists here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Any sympathy I might have once had for you and yours was exhausted long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Exhausted the moment my way—that of the Cursed Beasts—was rejected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The Cursed Beasts are your...way? You created the Cursed Beasts?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I am the unquestioned way of this world. All of this world is of my creation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Why what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If you made this world, then why?! Why would you create something as terrible as the Cursed Beasts?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If only they had never existed, then...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Then the Sephira, the previous Vessels of Purification...Julia. None of them would have ever needed to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Her love deserved more than to end so prematurely! She and my brother should have been able to have an entire future together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I see your hatred, your desire for revenge for the deaths of your loved ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I am curious whether or not you truly believe those emotions are justified.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You're...curious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes. The day you lost Julia, your comrade in arms, I too, lost someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Nidhogg. Though it was unfortunate that it forgot the duty entrusted to it and ran amok...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It was among the select few I consider to be dear to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You... What were you to the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Your people destroyed Nidhogg for the sake of your own survival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If I, in turn released the Cursed Beasts, would it not have been justified in your opinion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I... I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Your self-centered justice is limited and bigoted. It sees only what has been done unto you and not what has been done unto others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That is why your fate is to be destroyed by the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What? Wait, what are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>And yet you speak of love. How curious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>This love you speak of is little more than a basic instinct that all creatures possess, that is better known as lust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What is the purpose of granting it more importance than it is truly owed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Love and lust are different! They must be. They just have to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Julia always looked so happy because of that love she treasured so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Even though it was a love that could never be requited! Despite that, it made her smile so blissfully!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Without love, why would we bother caring for and supporting one another? I believe that is what separates love from pure lust!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Are you willing to put yourself on the line to prove that there is a difference between the two?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>In your world, lust is the love trap that ensures the continuation of a species.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I will be watching your actions carefully, as they will prove either that love can truly save your pitiful existences, or that it is little more than survival instinct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>However—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hmph. More uninvited guests have entered my realm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Who dares?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Nngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>N-Ni...mul...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Good, you're awake. It sounded like you were having a nightmare or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'm sorry for making you worry. I had...a strange dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>How much do you remember? We were attacked by Beelzebub, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Oh! The village! What happened to everyone?! Are they all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Where...is this place? Everything is...white. I've never seen anything like this before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Nor have I. I believe that somehow we ended up in an entirely different belt region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Aaahh! It's cold! It's so cold! I wish I'd brought along warmer clothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I believe that this is what is known as snow. In addition to the cold, this place is quite dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>How is our ship?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Er...well... It's not looking good, boss. Definitely can't fly yet. I mean, the ship took some damage but the real problem is the reactor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>So the ship usually compresses the magil in the air to make energy, but the intake mechanism was damaged when we got hit and now the magil conversion rate is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>In short, you are saying that it will not fly without repair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Why've you gotta be like that, Waginau? I was still talking! It's rude to just cut in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What is the point of wasting time with a technical explanation? In an emergency, simple and straight to the point is most effective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Well, yeah, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I see. How long will the repairs take?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>So, my initial assessment is, uh...a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You said that you'd be able to fix it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>That was before I saw the extent of the damage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>It's pretty bad. It's the magil intake mechanism that's broken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Plus, it's not exactly easy to do this out in the elements, what with this blizzard and everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Ah... I can see how it would be difficult to do precision work in this weather.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>That's not even the least of it! The Engineer Soldiers aren't built for the cold! Their oil keeps freezing, and the monitors keep fogging up... It's a huge pain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Ugh! If we had to crash in the Luxuria Belt Region, couldn't we at least have ended up somewhere where the weather is a little more stable?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Luxuria? Lust...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Oh! Emmel! You're awake, then! That's great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>So yeah! We're in a new Belt Region!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>It's the Luxuria Belt Region. With all this ice and snow that never melts, I seriously think this is the worst one of the lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>The Luxuria Belt Region...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It feels like there's no end to these little surprises. It's hard not to feel overwhelmed by it all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Of course, Adaleigh did talk about this place, but I never thought that it would be so cold as this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>It's hard to believe that people live here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Right. Well, you see—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>This is the heart of the Luxuria Belt Region, the territory of the Cursed Beast, where the cold winds rage and scream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Just west or south of this area, we'd be in much more comfortable weather.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Why do you always have to steal my thunder, old dog? I was about to say that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I have a name, you know. And I am neither old, nor a dog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>How shall we handle this, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>It's freezing outside, and the ship can't fly at the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>It's still warm inside the ship, but how long will that last?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Well, it'll stay warm for as long as the reactor holds up, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Like I said, the magil intake mechanism is dead, so it's not going to last that long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>For this to happen when it is urgent that we return to the Sephira village is a complete disaster!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>That was your hometown, right? That's a pretty big deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Aw, man. I'm sorry. If only my ship were made of sturdier stuff, then you wouldn't all be stuck here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>No, I must apologize. I am frustrated, but you have done all that you can for us. I didn't mean to sound as if I was accusing you of anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>The fact of the matter is that it's not possible to repair the ship at the moment. We'll have to wait for better weather conditions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Isn't that right, Adaleigh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Unfortunately, we don't know anything about the weather patterns of this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>It's possible that if we wait, we might just end up freezing to death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Then I propose the following. Why don't we leave the ship here for now and try to make our way to where there are other people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>If I understood you correctly, Adaleigh, there are people living not too far from here. Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Yeah. Last time I was here there was a settlement that helped me out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Then we should make our way there, gather information and supplies, and also take the time to plan out how we will repair the ship. I believe that this is the right course of action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I have no objections.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I am glad to hear it. Let us waste no more time in setting out, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Is everyone else okay with this new plan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Sounds good to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I agree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Emmel? If you don't feel up to it, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>No, Nimul. I'm fi—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>In your world, lust is the love trap that ensures the continuation of a species.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I see. In that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Aaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Wh-what is it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>There's something huge right outside of the ship!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>This shaking... Is that the wind?! The snow storm seems to be getting stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>This presence... Everyone, prepare yourselves! It's here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>What?! What's here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>What?! No way! This magil response is almost on the same level as that Guardian Dragon's...maybe even greater!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>No... This is...! That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>The ruler of the frozen lands...the Cursed Beast Asmodeus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>What was that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>The hull's taken some damage! The magil response is increasing with the snow storm! We've got a group of monsters or something attacking us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Nrk...! The ship can't take much more damage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Waginau! Yna! We need to do something about that magil response!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>R-right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>What should I do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Provide support from inside the ship! It should be enough to have the Engineer Soldiers back us up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
