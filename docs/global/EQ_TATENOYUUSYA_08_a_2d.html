<td>You okay, Melty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Y-yes, everything's fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I can't help but feel worthless and weak since I'm always being protected by you all... I wish that I could stand next to you and fight for myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's not true. You fight just fine with your magic abilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Sure, but that's not the point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>As someone with royal standing, I should be the one protecting everyone, but instead...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're all fighting for me right now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Melty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm not sure why you're freaking out about this. People at the top of the food chain have their own ways of fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You should think more about that if you're really a princess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My own way of fighting...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What's wrong, Naofumi? Something bothering you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It feels like they're getting more restless the further we head down the road... I wonder if something is upsetting them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The reason for their disturbance may be just ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You're right... It looks like these monsters are running more rampant than the ones we've already seen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I wonder if it's because the wave's coming soon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes... The monsters here have sensed the presence of the monsters from the other world—your world. That must be agitating them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Monsters are getting more agitated the closer we get to the village... And Balloons are heading straight for it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Could it be that the Wave will occur...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Naofumi! There you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Melty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It hasn't been too long since Raphtalia and Filo left this village. We need to catch up with them now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No... We need to stop looking for them for now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We both need to stay here and prepare to take on the Wave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>H-hold on, what are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm sure those two want to see you again as soon as possible, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's not like we'll never go looking for them. I simply said to stop for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But why do we need to stop?! Explain yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You're the one who said we can't take the Wave on without them! So why are you changing your mind now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...We're out of time, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The time frame you gave us for the next Wave is drawing closer. Have we figured out where it'll occur yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I think we have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>How did you figure that out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The Balloons are heading for the village, but they're not the most intelligent of creatures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Whatever's attracting them here must be speaking to their instincts... They must be sensing something connected to our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Waves are the rifts of different dimensions from which monsters pour out of. The calamity of our world... The Balloons sense it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>In the same way, monsters of this world who are sensitive to that presence must get more agitated as they get closer to it... Just like the monsters who are getting closer to this village are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>In other words, the Wave will be occurring in this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>We're too late—the wave's coming any minute now. We won't be able to evacuate the villagers in time if we go looking for those two now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What are your friends supposed to do in the meantime, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The Heroes must suppress the Waves, meaning they'll always find their way towards them. They'll figure out where I am once it starts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Raphtalia and Filo will come here eventually once the Wave occurs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You sure have a lot of faith in them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I guess you could say that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(That's why he wasn't in a rush to find them... I can't believe I jumped to conclusions like that...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Um, Naofumi, I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>S-someone, please help! Monsters are in the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Th-there's so many of them! And everyone is freaking out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I don't blame 'em. It's no fun having someone barge into your home like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We're not gonna let 'em get away with it, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Here they come!</td>
