<td>So this is the next target, is it? A loan shark by the name of Kanayoshi Gozoh... Interesting name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Let's go, Tsuru!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Infiltration successful. And would you look at all this treasure! Someone hasn't been too careful with the money they've taken from others...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The money should really be restored to the rightful owners. Don’t worry, I’ll save you the trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Aaand...all set! Okay, time to head out, Tsuru!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oops! Not yet. I almost forgot to leave behind a calling card! How rude of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What? You don't see the point of what I've written here? Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh? What's this? A...card?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>”I've taken the most valuable piece of art in this place. Yours truly, the Phantom Thief Chat Noir.” What?! Phantom thief?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>To not only have gotten past the security of this place, but to have done it before me? Well, color me surprised...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What am I saying, I can't dwell on this. I have to get out of here. Come on, Tsuru!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's lovely out tonight, isn’t it? Perfect weather for a late night stroll... So, what brings you to this tycoon’s mansion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Who are you? Wait, are you that—what was it again—“phantom thief"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I am indeed the Phantom Thief Chat Noir, notorious for my exploits all across the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I had heard that the legendary thief called the Night Fox could be found here in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Correct me if I am wrong, but...would that happen to be you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>And if it is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Then it would be my displeasure to tell you that you’re not at all what I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I was quite excited about getting to meet the legendary Night Fox, but... Oh, well. I suppose I built the moment up too much in my head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The legends about the Night Fox are true. The Night Fox is the most skilled thief in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>However... Perhaps you were expecting my teacher, who was the previous Night Fox.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I inherited the title from him. I am the new Night Fox.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ah... Now it all makes sense! So you're not the original, you're just his successor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So, what? You came to Wadatsumi just to confirm whether or not the Night Fox legend was true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Of course not. I am here to steal this country's most valuable treasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Just to steal, huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm curious, second-generation Night Fox. What motivates you to plunder?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Why...? I just... My teacher...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Uh-oh. We've been discovered!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh, dear. Our conversation has dragged on for far too long. Time to go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Shall we go half-and-half on these guards, successor? I would greatly appreciate the help, if it is not too much for you to handle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>How high-handed! He's treating me like some kind of servant... Come on, Tsuru!</td>
