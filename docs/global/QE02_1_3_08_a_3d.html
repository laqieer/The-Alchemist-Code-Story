<td>Hey, how far down does this thing go? Don't you think we're going a little too deep?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wait, I'm starting to see some kind of light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Whoa...! Wow! What is this vast open space?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's large enough to hold a motorbike race here comfortably. Is this an auditorium or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wait. What's that? That thing in the center...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Is it a pedestal for the Sacred Stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You might be right. There's a depression there that could've been made by placing something like a heavy stone on top.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh?! Wh-whoa! What is this?! Lo-look carefully all around us! Concentrate your eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hold on... What...is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>There is a myriad of holes closely packed together on the floor! Do these shapes...belong to Demons?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Were there Demons asleep here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hounds! Three Hounds closing in, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>In a place like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I guess that means the Beckrams come and go as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Were the Demons they allowed to spread originally from here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wh-what's that? There's a Hound on top of two other Hounds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's their fusion function where three become one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, they've transformed into one large dog with three heads!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Aye, they've combined to become an even more powerful creature commonly known as Cerberus!</td>
