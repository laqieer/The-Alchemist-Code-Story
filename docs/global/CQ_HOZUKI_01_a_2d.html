<td>My father said this to me when I was young.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Culture is made and cultivated in the hearts of the people who live in a place. All culture that exists today is what has been passed down from the generations that came before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>However, as times change, so too do the minds of people. Culture that cannot keep up with those changes will die out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>In order for culture to continue on as tradition, something fresh and new must be continually incorporated into its foundation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wadatsumi's current culture is very insular. With the world rapidly changing every day, if we continue on as we are, we will be left behind by the rest of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The time is now! Flower arrangement is being tested by the changing times, but I will not fail this test!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...All right, it's finished! For the first time in Wadatsumi's history, a glorious arrangement that makes use of foreign flowers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh! An arrangement using flowers from Gluttony! It's so cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hehe, right? I drew on traditional Wadatsumi flower arranging techniques to draw out the full beauty of the foreign flowers to their fullest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Flowers from a foreign land... Oh, these are the flowers that you brought back when you traveled outside Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But why are you showing this to me first?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm a calligrapher, so I don't know much about the technical side of flower arranging.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's because seeing your writing that one time made me feel like I was in another land, and that's what made me think of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh! Um, are you talking about the book where I incorporated elements of calligraphy based on the style of books in another land?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's the one! Normally a pen is used to write in such a smooth, round, and soft style, but you somehow did it with brushes prone to smearing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's so unique in Wadatsumi that it really gave me a thrill when I saw it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>A thrill... You felt that from my work and made such a magnificent arrangement with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>As a fellow cultivator of Wadatsumi culture, I can't afford to be outdone! I thought about this arrangement a lot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Now let's show this to the traditionalists! Hehe, I think this will open a new door for flower arrangement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh! Hozuki, wait! Hm... I wonder if it'll go over well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What are these flowers? I've never seen them before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Those are flowers from Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Flowers from another land? Is it all right to be using those?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Isn't using flowers from another land disrespectful to our traditions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What?! O-of course it isn't! It's because I'm respecting our traditions that it came out this sparkly and beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Sparkly? Any creations based on things from another land are just pale imitations of the real thing. Hmph. What a waste of my time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I-imitation?! This is not an imitation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh no, I hoped this wouldn't happen...</td>
