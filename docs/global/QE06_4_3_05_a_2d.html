<td>I grew up hating humans. From the very core of my being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>And my sister should've been the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But one day, she changed. She no longer felt that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And she was so much happier for it. Her smile was so bright. So, I thought it was okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If a world that unified humans and demons could make Kaede smile like that, then I swore I'd do everything I could to protect that world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But I didn't, did I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I can't remember what happened after all that. All I know is that my hatred for humans slowly consumed me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It was always with me, at my core. I may have buried it, but it was still a part of me all along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I just ultimately wound up surrendering myself to that familiar feeling. And what I found at the end of that road was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>An even greater hatred of humans from another. A rage that desired to destroy everything. One that resonated with the rage I once felt, brought it back to the fore, and made it stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What is it I wanted to protect? What was even my goal anymore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I hated humanity so much, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I began to lose sight of who I am...of whom I'd become.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You know exactly who you are, though. You just won't admit it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I wonder what actually differentiates demons from humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I don't have time for you or your stupid questions right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Honestly, I think it all just comes down to diet and appearance, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Shut up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>There's only so much you can do about your appearance, but I've lived off human food for a long time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>And I can tell you this much: Celis' meatballs were seriously the best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I said, shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I... I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You're being offered an olive branch here. There are people willing to help you. It's okay to let them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You are not to say another word!</td>
