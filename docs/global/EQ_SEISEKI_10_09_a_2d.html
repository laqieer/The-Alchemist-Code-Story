<td>Northern Pride. Headquarters of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Lord Commander Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Basheeny...how is Almira's condition?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Fortunately, there is no risk to her life. Still, the wound was surprisingly deep. She is currently receiving treatment by the medical unit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I see. What is going on? What were you doing with Almira...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I had received a report from Kazahaya that she was headed with Captain Othima to Saga, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's a long story. However, in summary, while heading to Saga, I encountered the fleeing Almira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Fleeing? From Saga region?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes. She told me she was able to escape due to Kagura's quick judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Were they attacked by Greed Dike in Saga? Yauras wasn't able to make it out in time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Regarding that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is difficult for me to report, but...Captain Yauras was killed in the line of duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>She was slaughtered by the Templar's leader Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Furthermore, Sol...he has detained Captain Kagura and is said to be currently headed to Saga region in order to seize the Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Before making his way to Saga, Captain Othima informed me that protecting the Matter was the highest priority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm sure he will be able to rescue Captain Kagura as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Is that all...true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes...unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>My lady...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Currently, Greed Dike's main army is approaching us here in Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We encountered them ourselves. Their numbers are vast to the point that we could not determine where their ranks ended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I believe that Captain Yauras and Captain Kagura assisted Almira in her escape in order to pass on this report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I thank the two of you for this report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We serve at your pleasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huff...huff... We've received a report from the frontlines!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Greed Dike's army is approaching! Their exact numbers are undeterminable due to their endless ranks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This is unmistakably Greed Dike's main army!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Mistress...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Proceed to intercept immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Inform both the Royal Palace and the Holy Order to hurry with the evacuation of all citizens! Basheeny, contact each squadron!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Very well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...So, it's finally gotten to this point! I won't let you do as you please, Orion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Saga region. Near the Wind Temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Venom Arrow Rain!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hyaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I heard you were calm and calculated. Your passionate attack plays quite against my image of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I heard that you were a man who destroys without discrimination or regard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The most efficient way to avoid further damage is to finish you off as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Efficient, huh? I heard that was your catchphrase.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>However, aren't you acting in contrary to your beliefs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You went out of your way to appear before us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If you had hidden along with the rest of the wind tribe, you could've prevented any and all casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'm a captain of the Holy Guard. I would never run while letting you remain unchecked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>No...that's not that the only reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You're going to tell me you're here to take me down and save this redhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>However, the truth is that there's a reason you can't move from here, isn't there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>A reason she can't move...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I told you just now, didn't I? The Matter has consistently been stored within the temples.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I doubt this tribe is an exception.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You managed to evacuate all your people, but...you cannot move the Matter from this temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>If someone has to protect the Matter...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It's pretty much predetermined who that person would be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>In other words...the final Matter is still stored in this temple. Or else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You wouldn't do something so inefficient as launching an ambush against me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...Seida...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...Are you finished?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Heartbreaking Arrow!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ack...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You can conjecture about my presence as much as you like. Either way, I'm going to finish you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>He-hey! Hold on a second...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>No. I won't give you a moment's grace. This is where it ends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Tsk! You won't even let me get a word in...?! In that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Wh-whoa...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Seriously... You may be getting worked up, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I have here one of your precious comrades. If I were to use her as a shield like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You're an idiot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You really don't know anything about us, do you? Look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>...?! He-hey...didn't you hear me?! Can't you see her here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>From the moment we each became a Paladin, we resolved ourselves to our fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>In order to rid this world of any and all threats, we are more than willing to sacrifice ourselves. Isn't that right, Kagura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>We of the Holy Guard will never succumb to you and your kind! Twin Fang God Wolf!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Argh! Dodge it!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Whoa...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>That was close... What power! Hey...are you okay, redhead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>How about you worry about yourself instead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Where did all those arrows come from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>You've been targeted from every angle. You have nowhere to run. Goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Ack...?! Arghhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Yes...! Seida!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>...No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>That impact just now...that wasn't my technique!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I think you should retract that last goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>You suppress your emotions and calmly take down your enemy. I'll have to admit, I don't dislike your composed attitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Hey, you...do you want to be my woman?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Sol...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Ack! Sorry, but I'm not into kids!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I see. That's unfortunate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>The Alize people settlement...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>No matter how much I fall for a woman, it goes against my philosophy to obtain her by force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>From behind...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Even if I were to obtain someone by force, their heart will never belong to me. It's unfortunate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Seidaaaa!!!</td>
