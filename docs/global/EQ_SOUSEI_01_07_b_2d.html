<td>Yeah, we're fine. How are the villagers faring?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We've managed to evacuate the majority. That is... Thanks to Yna Ku's assistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yna's...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I borrowed your airship, Adaleigh. I hope you don't mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Not at all. In fact, nice work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Adaleigh... Yna... You've both done so much for my people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>W-well, duh! Why wouldn't we help out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Oh, no... The divine protection of the Guardian Dragon is fading from the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Already?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>The Great Nidhogg's divine protection...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Oh, Chief...! Is this further punishment for our sins?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We depended so heavily on Sephiron...and now her wrath, and the wrath of the Great Nidhogg, descend upon us!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>From wisdom comes understanding, from understanding comes mercy, from mercy comes severity, from severity comes beauty, from beauty comes victory, from victory comes glory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Glory is the foundation, and upon the foundation does the kingdom form! With hidden knowledge in hand, heed my voice!</td>

<td>The Great Nidhogg...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>It's changed direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Where is it headed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>

<td>L-Lady Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>She has merely fainted. Hardly a surprise, given that she expended so much power.</td>
</tr>
