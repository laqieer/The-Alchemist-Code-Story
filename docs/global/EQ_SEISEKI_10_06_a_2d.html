<td>The only captains left under Lord Commander Kanon would be Captain Othima and Captain Seida. What is going to happen?</td>

<td>Huh...?</td>

<td>Kanon always told me that you're always supporting her when it matters, Basheeny!</td>

<tr>

<td>Everyone is relying on you?! Don't lose faith now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Both Captain Yauras and Kagura entrusted this to us! Whatever happens, we have to...</td>

<td>...Almira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...Hide!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh? Wh-whoa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Is that...Greed Dike's main army?! Look how many of them there are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's like I can't see where their numbers end... They've increased their numbers exponentially since when we encountered them in Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hmph. You're Paladins, yet I smell darkness within you. What a strange one you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh...?! Get down, Almira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I see. You've countered my blow. A somewhat worthy opponent for a change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ack...?! Are you a Templar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>A Templar...?! What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>My name is Zangetsu. I am who despises Paladins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So you have nothing to do with Greed Dike?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't like groups.</td>

<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I am merely taking advantage of the situation that the Holy Guard has been placed in due to all this conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The time has come! The time take down the Lord Commander Kanon who stands in my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...Where is she? Is she in Northern Pride?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>D-do you really think I'd tell you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Aghh...!</td>

<tr>

<td>Ack! Lo-Lord Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hehe. You're not going to tell me you've decided to switch sides again, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Agh! Almira! Behind me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hehe. Do you think you can escape an army like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Th-this is really looking bad! What should we do...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hyahah! The once noble Holy Guard and now look at you. How the mighty have fallen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Argh! Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>A-a large horse is closing in! It's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Orion...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Waginau, what are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ah! That brat Basheeny, who went over to the Holy Guard's side, is blocking the path ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We're wasting time. Take care of him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...You don't have to tell me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I've been told by my leader to take out any who block the march on Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Behind us...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Wh-whoa...when did they get there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Soldiers of Greed Dike, there's no need for you to make a move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>W-who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I am one of the Templars...Zehn. In accordance with my master's orders, I will take you out for blocking our path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The Templars! Almira, be careful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>G-got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What're you doing? Are you dancing around in order to show off your blade?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Does this look like a dance to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...Aghhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Almira?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Wa...was I just...cut down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It can't be...?! Almira!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>How?! How did you get to Almira when she's behind me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>So...you're the one who killed Vier with the help of Monzein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I will not let those who've murdered my comrades survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Under my iron command...your life is surely forfeited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>A-another blade...?! Not good...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...Grand Cross!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ugh! You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Huh? Did you do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What are you playing at? I thought you despised the Paladins...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Of course, the Holy Guard are nothing more to me than an entity that must be annihilated. Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I have no intention of joining you, Greed Dike. You, too, are nothing more than an entity that must be annihilated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I see. So you turn your blade against us as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>To begin with, my cursed fate began...when you people destroyed my homeland of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>In other words...your annihilation takes priority over the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Because of your greed, you senselessly destroyed my homeland. Taking you down now...seems to be the most logical course of action!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Heheh. I'd love to accept your invitation; however, I happen to be quite busy at the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Never mind. Take him out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
