<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>What a beautiful flower, Yuffie! You've taken really good care of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>... ...♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hm? Are you going to give me a flower? Thanks, I'll take good care of it. It's a small flower, but blue and beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(I think this was called a begonia. It's the flower that I was never able to find out what its language was...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(Oh, that's it! I'll ask Dario to teach me how to read.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(That way I can learn from Yuffie this flower's language.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's Dario's portion, right? Don't be embarrassed. I'm sure he'll really like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yuffie...she's finally starting to smile naturally. I'm so glad that we get to live here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Is Gabirond being careless with money again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Apparently, he needs it to tidy up the hardline factions within the Envylia court.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>First Wratharis and then Envylia. He works hard...well, I have been paying for him to do what he does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>When everything comes to fruition, he promises you will be rewarded handsomely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Of course. How much does he think I've supported him? I do intend to get a return on my investment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>By the way, regarding the ancient weapon, do you truly plan to take it outside of this country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Even the Corpse was helpless when it came to that object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Haha! There's no way an outsider can wield Wratharis' ultimate weapon. In order to activate it, you need a special key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I've finally discovered what the key is. My business here is finally done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Your business is done? I thought you were going to move to Northern Pride once you ensured your father's death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That was the original plan, but father is fairly stubborn... If the dosage of poison is increased, he might notice it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Having your brother continue to give him poison disguised as medicine is a lot of work, isn't it? I could just kill him for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That would be no fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Is there any fun to be had in the death of a human?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Don't be an idiot. The death of another is the ultimate form of entertainment. That is what I learned at the Dawn of Wrath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>At that battle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Back then, I was studying economics at Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>When my homeland began the war, at first I panicked. However, something unexpected occurred. Having discovered that I was Wratharis nobility...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The merchants flocked to me for my help in selling weapons and goods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I mediated the sale of weapons to the nobility and they paid handsomely for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ultimately, when Wratharis was destroyed, what do you think was left to me? A vast fortune.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Even though my homeland had been destroyed, I was able to gain a massive amount of wealth. That's when I understood that war becomes money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The more other people kill other people, the more money that can be made. Have you ever heard anything more invigorating? I decided to move to the side of enjoyment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The reason why I fund the Corpse is because I want to grow your little spark of conflict. I want to enjoy the death of more people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The more tragic the circumstances, the better the wine tastes. Witnessing the death of others is the highest form of entertainment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I appreciate your support. However, I cannot understand your mindset.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That's quite the irony to be told that by a killer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The Corpse's main aim is not to kill, but ultimately to obtain the Sacred Stones...who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>... ...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Not good...did someone hear us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ah, Yuffie...don't worry. Not only can she not speak, but she can neither read nor write. It doesn't matter what she hears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You may be all right with that, but it's problematic for me. I'm sorry, but I'll have to tie up this loose end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The Corpse can truly be a tedious bunch. No, wait, if you're going to do it at least let's come up with an elaborate plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Dario! Did you see Yuffie? I can't find her anywhere...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What?! It isn't the bandits, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Bandits?! They took Yuffie?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm not sure, but...recently, there have been people arriving to inhabit the forest nearby. I was careless as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Oh...! We need to save her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You're right. That being said, it would be too dangerous for just you and me to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'll go ask Sir Crowley for his help. Wait here until I get back! Understood? Don't wander into the forest alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>O-okay...understood. Please hurry, brother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Of course! I'll be back right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Dario still isn't back! Meanwhile, who knows what's happening to Yuffie...Yuffie...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Argh...I can't wait anymore! I'll go rescue Yuffie on my own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yuffie! Yuffie! Ack... If only I could hear some sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yuffie...? Are you over there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Stop!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You! You! Let Yuffie go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Jeez. What a messy situation. But I must obey Lord Dario's instructions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Aghh...? You...let Yuffie...go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...! ...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What a feisty brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Aghh...! Arghh...Yuffie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Ack? Huh? ...Dario?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You're putting up a surprising amount of resistance, Dias.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Brother?! What are you doing? Move your foot...please! Yuffie is...! The bandit is over there...where's Zeke?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hm? Oh. Zeke isn't coming. More importantly, Yuffie's on the verge of being killed. You better save her soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Agfff...! Br-brother...? Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Look, Dias. Your adorable little sister is about to be killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Brother, please stop! Aghh...Yuffie...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Lord Dario, isn't that enough? At least allow her not to suffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Stop! Stoooooppppp!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Oooohhh!!! Yufffiiieee...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Oh dear, she died... Your sister, who was so desperate for your help...but you let her get slaughtered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You're a terrible person, Dias.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Wh-what are you talking about? What are you saying?! You murderer! Yuffie...ohh, Yuffie!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Dario, you were tricking us. All this time...you were tricking us. Aaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>But you know that's not true, Dias. You need to change your tone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>It's supposed to be: "Thank you for using a helpless, incompetent, worthless brat like me as a tool, Lord Dario." Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You got to be played by me like a toy. You should be grateful, Dias.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Here. Say it. "Thank you for using and disposing of me, Lord Dario."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Huh? Did you not hear me very well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I said die, you piece of filth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>How unfortunate. I never expected you to be such a stupid child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hey... If someone were to hear all this commotion, it could be troublesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Yes. You're right. Let's go soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Lord Dario, the mansion has been cleaned up as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Who's there?! I couldn't sense you at all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>This is my private army. Don't worry. Business is often accompanied by complications. This is one of the individuals I hired for my own protection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>His name is the Jaw, which comes from his ability to crush and consume every blade that opposes him. He can come quite in handy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>As long as there's money, I'm selective about my work. Setting an aristocrat’s mansion on fire is a walk in the park.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Tonight, House Nash will disappear. I'm sure my bed-ridden father will burn well too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...Let's take out this kid too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Ah, that won't be necessary. What can a helpless little brat like this ever hope to accomplish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Discard him. Just the thought of him struggling to live with the truth of his own weakness and the regret of having not been able to save his sister...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Oh, the pleasure of it! Wouldn't you agree, Dias? I want you to live forever with that feeling of helplessness and regret inside of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Remembering this will make any wine I taste that much more delicious! Ahahahahahahahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>What a pitiful child. If you choose to blame anything, blame yourself for having been born into this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Everything was burned down. What exactly happened to Lord Nash?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Dias, if you would like it, come live at my house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Are you going to be the one to use me this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>(?! What cold and dark eyes this child has...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>(...Ultimately, I survived. I became my father's adopted son...and I spent my days with Logi and Agatha...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>(Still, I never fully trusted my father.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>(Deep inside my heart, I was afraid of being betrayed again.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>(Gabirond took advantage of this vulnerability. Honestly...it's pathetic. Only now can I see that.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>(The mayor, Gabirond, Dario...they are only able to see others as tools.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>(My father was never that way.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I could not even realize such a simple truth as that. Father, I couldn't see anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Yet, that time, when I cut you down...I did not regret it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>No matter the reason, the one thing I could not let you do was to kill Agatha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Enough. I've had enough of seeing my sisters dying in front of my eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>What's the commotion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Ack! Why are there monsters here out of all places...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Hold formation! We are the proud Paladins of the Holy Guard.</td>
