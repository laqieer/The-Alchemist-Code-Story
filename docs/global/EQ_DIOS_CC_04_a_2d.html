<td>Is Gabirond being careless with money again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse</td>
<td>Apparently, he needs it to tidy up the hardline factions within the Envylia court.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>First Wratharis and then Envylia. He works hard...well, I have been paying for him to do what he does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse</td>
<td>When everything comes to fruition, he promises you will be rewarded handsomely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>Of course. How much does he think I've supported him? I do intend to get a return on my investment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse</td>
<td>By the way, regarding the ancient weapon, do you truly plan to take it outside of this country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse</td>
<td>Even the Corpse was helpless when it came to that object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>Haha! There's no way an outsider can wield Wratharis' ultimate weapon. In order to activate it, you need a special key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>I've finally discovered what the key is. My business here is finally done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse</td>
<td>Your business is done? I thought you were going to move to Northern Pride once you ensured your father's death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>That was the original plan, but father is fairly stubborn... If the dosage of poison is increased, he might notice it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse</td>
<td>Having your brother continue to give him poison disguised as medicine is a lot of work, isn't it? I could just kill him for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>That would be no fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse</td>
<td>Is there any fun to be had in the death of a human?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>Don't be an idiot. The death of another is the ultimate form of entertainment. That is what I learned at the Dawn of Wrath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse</td>
<td>At that battle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>Back then, I was studying economics at Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>When my homeland began the war, at first I panicked. However, something unexpected occurred. Having discovered that I was Wratharis nobility...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>The merchants flocked to me for my help in selling weapons and goods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>I mediated the sale of weapons to the nobility and they paid handsomely for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>Ultimately, when Wratharis was destroyed, what do you think was left to me? A vast fortune.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>Even though my homeland had been destroyed, I was able to gain a massive amount of wealth. That's when I understood that war becomes money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>The more other people kill other people, the more money that can be made. Have you ever heard anything more invigorating? I decided to move to the side of enjoyment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>The reason why I fund the Corpse is because I want to grow your little spark of conflict. I want to enjoy the death of more people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>The more tragic the circumstances, the better the wine tastes. Witnessing the death of others is the highest form of entertainment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse</td>
<td>I appreciate your support. However, I cannot understand your mindset.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>That's quite the irony to be told that by a killer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse</td>
<td>The Corpse's main aim is not to kill, but ultimately to obtain the Sacred Stones...who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuffie</td>
<td>... ...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse</td>
<td>Not good...did someone hear us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>Ah, Yuffie...don't worry. Not only can she not speak, but she can neither read nor write. It doesn't matter what she hears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse</td>
<td>You may be all right with that, but it's problematic for me. I'm sorry, but I'll have to tie up this loose end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>The Corpse can truly be a tedious bunch. No, wait, if you're going to do it at least let's come up with an elaborate plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dios.png" alt="Dias" height="128"><br>Dias</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>What?! It isn't the bandits, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dios.png" alt="Dias" height="128"><br>Dias</td>
<td>Bandits?! They took Yuffie?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>I'm not sure, but...recently, there have been people arriving to inhabit the forest nearby. I was careless as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dios.png" alt="Dias" height="128"><br>Dias</td>
<td>Oh...! We need to save her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>You're right. That being said, it would be too dangerous for just you and me to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dario</td>
<td>I'll go ask Sir Crowley for his help. Wait here until I get back! Understood? Don't wander into the forest alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>But you know that's not true, Dias. You need to change your tone.</td>

<td>His name is the Jaw, which comes from his ability to crush and consume every blade that opposes him. He can come quite in handy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>As long as there's money, I'm selective about my work. Setting an aristocrat’s mansion on fire is a walk in the park.</td>
