<td>Oho! Well done!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hold it right there. We aren't finished yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Then I'll just have to finish you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmm? This sensation... You're no mere human, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I know not who is within you, but your familiarity with Koga and Kaede has proven most invaluable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I give you my gratitude for facilitating Tamba's resurrection. But for now, I must also bid farewell! Until we meet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Tch! It must be inconvenient for you to be around someone who knows the truth, huh? That's why you're turning tail and running!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And I do know the truth, Paragon. The malice brought forth by you and Greed Dike is the true enemy of Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And what reason would I have to fear that knowledge?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I understand your despair as well. And the pitiable event that created it. I sympathize with you, to an extent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But that doesn't mean I'll lose sight of what must be done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Tamba!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I told you. No more warnings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Nngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You're a tenacious one, aren't you? Even when there's no hope left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's not over yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Then let's end it already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You are a most impressive demon, I must say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Good. Then you won't mind telling me exactly what happened while I was sleeping.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'll be more than happy to fill you in. Shall we head back to our own territory?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't get the wrong idea. I still don't completely trust you, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Of course. You're wise to doubt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Farewell, humans!</td>
