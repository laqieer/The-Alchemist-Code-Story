<td>If you were at your best, then you would be stronger than me. Without a doubt, you would have won. I still have a long way to go, after all.</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>Right now, though, you can't beat me—and I think that's because you're lost, Chloe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>However, I truly believe that you can overcome this. You're a strong person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You may have lost sight of it, but I know that—even now—you hold a great sense of justice inside your heart!</td>

<td>So I'm asking you to leave this to us! Please, stay here.</td>

<td>Ngh!</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Nina!</td>

<tr>

<td>Don't overdo it! You're suffering, aren't you?</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If you overdo it and get yourself killed, I... I'll...!</td>

<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Don't worry. I won't die.</td>

<td>I have to lead the Scarlet Flame Guard in Sir Gerald's stead. This is no time for me to give up.</td>

<td>If I couldn't handle this, I'm sure he'd laugh at me.</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Nina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Besides, I'm sure that you're suffering more than I am. I have to do my best, for the both of us!</td>

<tr>

<td>What about you? Sir Gerald, he...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's true. My heart still hurts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I gave up, though. If I stopped working hard just because I'm sad about Sir Gerald, he would definitely be very upset with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I want to keep moving forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Besides, he was the one who told me that the scarlet flame in my heart will always be there to lift my spirits!</td>

<tr>

<td>Huzzaaaaaahh!</td>

<tr>

<td>Don't back down! We have the numbers! Let's overwhelm them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Tch... They just keep coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Victor! Look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Whoa! You saved my hide, Nina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Don't get too close to their front lines! We can't risk breaking formation! Natalie, if you would tend to the wounded...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm doing what I can, but there's too many of them! At this rate...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Don't lose hope! If we lose here, who is going to protect Envylia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So long as the Blue Flame Guard is immobilized, it falls on us to protect all of Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>All right! I hear you, loud and clear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Natalie, I know it's hard, but please keep going! All soldiers who can move after being treated, return to the battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Now is the time for us to demonstrate our iron will and complete our mission! Let's show them the power of the Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
