<td>…She's gone. Has she fallen off the cliff?</td>

<td>…!!!</td>

<td>Don't try to go after your royal partner. You can't save her from this height.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…She's not my partner. You have no right to speak of Kaede...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>…It appears blood is rushing to your head.</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…Urgh…ngh…!</td>

<td>…!!!</td>

<td>A demon protecting another… This "king" must be very important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…This doesn't concern you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Know your limits. You took a direct hit from Kagutsuchi. There's no way you're unscathed… Besides…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're missing a member of your party--the one called Kaede, who offset my abilities… That means your defense is weakened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And your other line of defense, has blood rushing to his head. I won't miss this chance--since I've already learned your "skill."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Now with Kagutsuchi staring you down… Let's see how long you can last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>…!</td>

<tr>

<tr>

<td>…Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>…Confound it… He's still too young.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'd expect no less from a chief. A wise decision… The alternative would have been your "king" burning in Kagutsuchi's fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The time is yet to come for our "king." When that day comes, the demons will delight in eradicating the human race.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Today was just a preview.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Don't. There's no use giving chase.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…Our side has incurred heavy damages. Give priority to treating the injured and see that the fallen receive a proper burial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>A demon that can offset my power, huh… I sensed they possessed a power similar to chakra… They can nullify the Phoenix Brigade's abilities, huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We may possess the arcane art, Kagutsuchi…but we must remain vigilant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>…I don't want there to be any more threats to our people, however…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I have no choice but to bear this burden…as a member of the Aquila Rubrum lineage.</td>
