<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>Incredible! I see that the dragon who smote the raining boulders at the world's end is as powerful as ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>You must have been underestimating me to presume any differently. We seven great dragons maintain the Truth of all dragonkind. You lot cannot hope to influence me with your weak manifesto.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>That may be true, but we can at least stall you for time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>You... No, you didn't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>Another detachment was headed for Lady Schmeier alongside us. They are surely neutralizing her as we speak. It's a tactic we learned from those humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>As long as we keep you preoccupied, the Dragon of Wisdom should prove effortless to capture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>A diversion! You conniving toads!</td>

<td>Schmeier! Lil! Where are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragons</td>
<td>Hnng...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>These must be members of that detachment. Did Schmeier do all this? Where could they be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Y-you're late...Zafeiris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Schmeier! Those wounds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>I...messed up. Heheh. I guess I've lost a bit of my edge during this brief window of peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Fortunately, these shouldn't be fatal, though they do hurt quite a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Where's Lil?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>As soon as I saw the raid coming our way, I put her through the Transporter and sent her out to the settlement where Claybelle lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>You let her go alone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>I had no other way of protecting her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>These are the coordinates where I sent her. Go, Zafeiris! Help her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>What are you saying? You're coming with—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Surely you've heard. Ophioneus has gone on the offensive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Lil will not be ready in time at this rate. We need to expedite our plans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>She must go on a journey. She must see the world and those who inhabit it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>But she's still far too young to do this alone. She'll need a guardian to watch over her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Come, now! None of that silent treatment this time! This is what you're best at.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I... I can't protect her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>You leave this to me, and it'll turn out just like before, on the day of that great calamity. I'm certain I'll—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Don't doubt yourself, Zafeiris! You're more capable than any of us. I believe in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Please...take care of our little girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Wait! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>I'll handle things here. Go! Don't let our hope die off alongside our species!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Schmeier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>What she needs now is experience. This journey will help her develop and learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>So, please. I'm begging you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>All right. Let's get you on your way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>Lady Schmeier! Prepare yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>You lot really don't know when to give up, do you? Why must you be so uppity? Indolence is good for the soul every now and again, you know. You'd enjoy life a lot more if you took things in stride!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>There's far too much at stake to be idle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>Lord Ophioneus has declared that the destruction of the Shell of the World is the only way we can complete the process of creation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>We shall be the foundation for the coming new age of humanity. That is the atonement required of us, as the sinful predecessors to those who inherit our legacy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>We have perverted this world, and this is the least we can do to make amends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>So Ophioneus has chosen to bequeath this world to the humans altogether, instead of living alongside them in it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>In other words, he's chosen the path of our immediate destruction. He's given up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>And that is precisely why your research is regarded as an impediment to the end we seek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>Giving free will to the Shell of the World... You are merely incrementing the obstacles that must be destroyed to achieve our grand design!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>That's not how I see it. We both want the humans to inherit everything that we have to offer them. I just think Ophioneus' method is the exact wrong way to go about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>So, of course, I'll be retaliating. You will not have her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>Then we will do what we must for the future we believe in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>As will I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Zafeiris... I'm counting on you.</td>
</tr>
