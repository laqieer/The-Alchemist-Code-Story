<td>Waginau, it's time! We will carve ourselves an opening in the dragon's flesh! Are you prepared?</td>

<td>Hmph... Naturally!</td>

<td>I am learned in the laws of this world. I will create a kingdom upon its ancient foundations.</td>

<td>This dragon held the Cursed Beast in check for years upon years... That its powers would not diminish after its fall is only to be expected.</td>
