<td>002</td>
<td>The old man...died?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Unfortunately...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>When Captain Yauras made her way to him, Captain Monzein was already close to death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>In other words, the rescue party didn't make it there in time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>By the time I rendezvoused with him, he had already endured fatal wounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...It's a little anticlimactic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>For Captain Yauras, it lacks that final touch. How can I say it? Like a joke without a punchline?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I don't want to believe it, but it's true. It hurts but we must accept the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>His only saving grace was his strength. And now he's dead? Hahah...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's pathetic. How am I supposed to accept this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I've had enough. There's no way that old man would die that easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>He still hasn't even bought me the meal he owes me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You gotta be kidding me. This is such nonsense. I'm not gonna accept it!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...Captain Othima...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm sorry. It's my fault. If he hadn't tried to protect me, Captain Monzein would still be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>When Monzein died, he used his Burning Seal. He fulfilled his code of chivalry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>All that occurred was the result of choices that Monzein made himself. I'll tell you this again: don't beat yourself over the head about any of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Enough with the mourning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Monzein sacrificed his life to entrust all of you with the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And if you repay him by moping...it would be truly putting to waste the sacrifice he made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Captain Othima... It's difficult for me as well to accept Captain Monzein's death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>After all, it was none other than him who taught me how to truly be a knight...but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I know...I know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I just can't be like, "I know what you mean," and accept it right now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I just need to get it out of my system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Understood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We're back, my lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Suzuka, Kazahaya...what's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>My apologies. We searched the library from end to end...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But we cannot seem to find any mention of the Veda Templars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I see. I wonder if they're a new organization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>They have enough power to take down Captain Monzein...and even Greed Dike appears to be wary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's safe to assume that they wield a considerable amount of power. Who exactly are they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>They are people of the shadow, who live in the deepest parts of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>They come from different places and their existence is not known to man. Of course there is no documentation on them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Why do you know so much about them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well...most likely, they originate from the Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Lost Blue...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's not known to most, but there is a place for those who have nowhere to call their own, those alientated from society...and those who have been dealt a bad hand by life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>In some ways, you could call it a lawless land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It should be in Slothstein's underground space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>A lawless land...where those alienated from society gather?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yes. Lost Blue is a deep sea village where there is no sky and light does not shine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The girl that we encountered in Lustburg, Acht...she said that she was from there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>There was no such record within all of the documentation material we've gathered from all across the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Why do you know of this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's because, apparently, Captain Othima is also originally from Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm not originally from there. I stayed there for a while when I was in my teens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Having been exiled from Lustburg, I moved around from place to place and just happened to arrive at that city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>So you know who they are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>No, I don't. After all, I was only there for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>There were a lot of people coming and going in search of Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>When I was there, if I recall correctly, there were a lot of people enquiring, but no one really teamed up together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>There is nobody more dangerous than that lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>"Veda"... Acht mentioned that word as well. What does it mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'm not sure how to describe it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Lost Blue is said to be a tower that cannot be seen which leads to another dimension.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>A tower that leads to another dimension?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It's quite hard to explain, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Most likely, it is made of a high-form of energy that could be Alchemy energy. It's a tower that exists without a physical form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>We call it the Mystic Tower Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>The Mystic Tower Veda...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yes. It's quite the mysterious tower. When you go there some of your five senses stop working properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I guess you could say you feel strangely sharp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What do people go there in search for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>The reasons vary, but to put it simply...there are those who go there because they want to discard or forget everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>There are also supernaturalists there who have transcended to a state beyond human knowledge. All of them are fascinated by the tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>After you left the city, Captain Othima...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The people who had gathered at Lost Blue became a band of mercenaries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>How come?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Who knows? They were just a group of uncooperative deviants who happened to be in the same place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>That being said...they did work together as thieves to help support the town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Are you saying that there's a chance that a portion of them were radicalized even further?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>It's not hard to consider, even if it's just a rumor...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I've even heard that the people of Lost Blue have contracts as assassins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I can't believe there's such a place that offers sanctuary to sinners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hey wait...I'd prefer if you didn't make outright assumptions like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I told you that Lost Blue was a place where people who were forced out of their world gather, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Amongst them there were those who had been removed from their world for innocent reasons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>There are others who had been saved by that place...like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You mean a part of it serves as the final basin that swoops up those who've lost their place in this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Yes. In any case, it's not possible to ignore that many people with combative capabilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I think we need to rebuild our strategies based around the capabilities of those powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>In the underground of the Slothstein area, a city called Lustburg exists, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>It'll probably be a waste to send soldiers there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>They knew about me. In other words, they must be aware that I can figure out Lost Blue's location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>In other words, even if we entered there, we wouldn't be able to get information on the Templars?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>They're terrible at cooperating...but they look after their own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Anyway, even if we were to get someone to talk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>There's no proof that they even exist so we wouldn't be able to determine any individual traits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>If it becomes a cat and mouse hunt, we'll just end up wasting soldiers that we could use elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>It'll be more efficient to focus on Greed Dike's movements right now than to chase them when we don't even know their location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Yeah. They should be accompanying Greed Dike in their quest to seize the next Sacred Stone anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I believe we should take measures as soon as possible to protect the countries that haven't been attacked yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>We were able to stop Lustburg's Sacred Stone Asmodeus from being stolen, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Envylia's Leviathan was rendered powerless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Next they'll aim for Wratharis' Satna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Or maybe Slothstein's Belphegor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>If they've received word about the Saga's Crystal Quartet Matter then there's a chance they may aim to obtain those.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Either way, they could attack here at any point...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>No...I feel like they won't show up here in Northern Pride for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Judging from what Captain Kudan had been talking about...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>The Lion Monarch Orion's goal is to obtain the Alchemy Source that Nimul had.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Judging from that point...I believe that to be the Tower of Babel that Nimul is said to have created...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>The tower that stands in the center of Northern Pride will be Greed Dike's final destination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>You're right. If that's the case, then the next place that Orion will head to would be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Neither Wratharis nor Slothstein, where the location of their Sacred Stones are uncertain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Saga's Matter...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I'm not sure. In the past, I might've made that assumption, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>He did end up appearing in Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Huh? Orion is famous for fighting at the vanguard, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>That's why I assumed he would act counterintuitively. The fact that he hasn't done that surprised me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Counterintuitively...that Lion Monarch Orion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Yes. Orion displays himself as brash and all action, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>That's just one side of him. In fact...I believe he is actually a calm and excellent tactician.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Huh?! A tactician?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>That was also my impression having encountered him face-to-face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Since you served under him, what do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Why do you think he chose to attack from the vanguard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Most likely...it's because he obtained something that allows him to have an advantage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>The Veda Templars!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Yes. A tactitian's plans can often be predicted by another tactitian.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Because he knows that...Orion went out of his way to introduce a chaotic element into his assault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>To be honest, I have absolute no read on the Veda Templars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>That can't be. Are you sure you're not underestimating yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>No. I'm certain of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>That man is mad, but he is also a substantially superior tactician who is playing on a whole other level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Meaning...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>If he is a tactician, then there is always the possibility that he would extend his reach to countries we might be less likely to consider.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>It's not good for us to always be on the defensive. I believe it's best if we launch a pre-emptive act.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Understood. Captain Othima, please head with Basheeny to Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>What about me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>You make your way to Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Just in case...it's important that Seida remains in Northern Pride so that she can utilize her ability to read over a wide terrain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>In that case...I guess I should head to Slothstein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Yes. If there are no problems there then make your way to Saga and rendezvous with Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Kagura, Captain Yauras...please look after Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Don't worry. Leave it to us. All right then...now that everything's been decided on, we've got no time to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Wait! Everyone...before you leave, please promise me one thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Promise what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Please promise me that you will come back here alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Huh? What's all that about? Don't be so dramatic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>She's not being dramatic, especially after what happened with Captain Monzein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>In fact, it would be highly efficient for us to refocus our mental state right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>We need to recognize just how formidable our enemy is. We can make it a lighthearted promise for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Yes. Come now. Everyone, let's raise our weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Not exactly a fancy farewell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Usually, these kind of feelings should be buried deep inside one's heart, you know? But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>I...will accept Monzein's unrefined determination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>I promise to prevent any further advancement of Greed Dike's army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Me too! I will not let Captain Monzein's death go to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>It's okay. Captain Monzein's soul continues to live within all of us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>For the sake of the ambitious Captain Monzein, we will not be beaten!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Of course. I can just imagine what he would say if I were taken down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I promise to return alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Thank you, everyone! For the sake of Captain Zain and Captain Monzein as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>We will shatter the ambitions of the Lion Monarch with our own hands!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>The Holy Guard have successfully driven off Greed Dike from their occupation of Envylia and Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>However...Envylia's Sacred Stone Leviathan has lost its power and Captain Monzein of the Second Order has died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>They had suffered too great a sacrifice to smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Meanwhile, the threat of Greed Dike continues to grow, led by the determination of one man...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>This threat will later be talked about through the ages as the largest ever to have arisen in the continent of Babel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>This is the memory of the mad monarch bearing the name Lion. And of the great war he began that would overturn the laws of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>THE ALCHEMIST CODE</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Sacred Stone Memories -The Destiny Harbored by the Lion Monarch-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>We will soon enter the territory of Wratharis. Be a wee bit careful now of your surroundings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Understood. Captain Othima, do you really think Greed Dike will show up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>We'll have to see. More importantly, there's something I want to ask you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Is it about the battle we fought in Envylia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>No... Do you have a favorite food or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Huh? A favorite...? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>It's a very important matter. The more specific you can be the better. Can you tell me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Um...okay! Ah, let me see...hmm...maybe...Melpoto mushroom stew?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>I see. Nice. Very useful. I'll make it for you sometime soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Huh? Th-thank you. Um, what is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Oh, nothing. It's just you're a tricky one to pin down, so I wanted to know what kind of things you liked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>I want to get along with you. You know...since the old man died, I realized I'm the only man out of all the captains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>...Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>On top of that, all the captains are strong-willed women...so I thought you might be a little lonely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Honestly...Greed Dike really messed things up for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Orion needs a real good kick in the pants for having caused this situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Yeah... We need to properly lay them to waste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>I'll assist you with everything that I've got. It's payback time for what they did to the General.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>General...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>I'm talking about Captain Zain. They corrupted Captain Kudanstein...and drove Captain Zain to his death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>After what they...what they did to the General who looked after me...! I'll do it...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Good. Your assistance shines like a beacon on the road of each land. It's indispensable. I'm counting on you, Kazahaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Yes! By the way, Captain Othima, there's one thing that I don't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>They tried relentlessly to steal Envylia's Sacred Stone, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Why did they give up so easily when it came to Lustburg's Sacred Stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Given their mentality, it's hard to imagine they'd give up until they managed to take it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>I feel like the hint may lie in the words "balance of power in this world."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>Balance of power...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Yes. By disrupting the balance of power in this world, it will bring about the appearance of the Alchemy Source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Since that's what Orion thinks, his goal is not to obtain all the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>As long as he can disrupt the balance of this world, I think he believes that's enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>Lustburg's Sacred Stone Asmodeus is kept stored in a special way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>It's enshrined high up in the sky, making it difficult to get ahold of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Maybe Orion determined that he didn't have enough time to waste on trying to obtain it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>So you think he'll only steal it if it's realistic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Yes. I think so. Lustburg's invasion was more for show.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>Most likely, he wanted to cause the Holy Guard to disperse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>He also wanted to lure out Seida, who is rumored to hold the Sacred Stone of Gluttony Foss. I believe that was his true motive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Then that means there's a chance he might not invade Wratharis and Slothstein as the location of their Sacred Stones are unknown...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>Then the Sacred Stone that is definitely in Northern Pride...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>And, if he has received information regarding it, the other alternative would be Matter in the Saga region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Don't you think he's moving towards either one of those?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>If that's the case, why send soldiers to Wratharis and Slothstein as well? What about heading to Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>To be honest, I half-suspected there was more to his moves than simple wastefulness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>...but it appears he just likes to play games.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>Be careful. It looks like they're going to engage with no questions asked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>Greed Dike soldiers? When did they get here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>Who knows? I'll give them hell for depriving me of the lunch that I was supposed to eat.</td>
</tr>
