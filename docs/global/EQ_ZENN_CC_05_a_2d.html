<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Papa! You're back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huh? You're not papa... Whoops! Sorry! I thought you were my papa. You kinda walk the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So, who're you? I've never seen you before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I always end up clinging to people who want nothing to do with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm Emperor Orion's younger brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I've never been able to say that freely... But, oh, how I've wanted to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>See, I'm the youngest of the dozen or so bastards born to the old king's concubines. I was conceived at the very end of his rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Orion was born to a different concubine, so we're half-brothers, technically. He was conceived at the beginning of the old king's rule, which is why there's such a significant age difference between us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>My father forgot I even existed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>He didn't bother to remember his many concubines' names, much less all the children of his they'd brought into this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Not even Orion remembers me. He doesn't realize I'm his brother. I suppose I'm too far down the line of succession to be memorable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>After all, it's not like lions remember the faces of the zebra on which they feast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My physical wants, at least, were never neglected. I was well fed and clothed, whether I wanted to be or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But I was always starved of familial affection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I do not weep to hear the shriek of cattle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The old king didn't bat an eye when my mother was killed by the members of an opposing faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's when I realized that the weak are doomed to be forgotten. It only makes sense. And, back then, I was nothing but a hunk of zebra, slowly passing through the lion's intestines. Why should he think of me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So I spent my days trying to come up with a way to become someone worthy of recognition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Until, one day, I had a great idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Are you asleep?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wha...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>A-Aya? Aya?! Aya! Wake up, Aya, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Y-you're bleeding...but it's going to be all right. Mama's going to heal you up, right as rain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Are you... Can you bring people back from the dead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>See? All better! Aya? Aya...? What's wrong, my darling? Why aren't you smiling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>There is no remedy for death, I'm afraid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Come on! Wake up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hrk! Ack... Hrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I am able to heal others by projecting their wounds onto my spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>N-no... I can keep going! I'm fine, my darling daughter, so please... Please wake up! Hrk... Ngh... Ack! Hrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Y-you're being brave, aren't you? Don't hold back, Aya. Tell me where it hurts, and I'll make it better. Please... Please say something. Anything. Please...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I can't do that with death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Haa...haa...haa! Wh-why isn't it working?! Why aren't you getting better?! Why won't you heal?! P-please don't go! Don't die! Don't leave me, my Aya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>———</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaahhh! Th-this can't be real... This can't be happening... This is just a nightmare, isn't it? Isn't it, Zehn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I... Ungh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>O-our lives together had...h-have only just begun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wake up, Aya! Please wake up! Open your eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh, Aya... I'm so sorry. This is all our fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Th-this must be our punishment for all the d-death we've caused. Wh-why did we think we could live on without a c-care in the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>B-b-but Aya doesn't deserve to pay for our mistakes! P-please...don't take her away from us! Bring her back! I beg you! I-I'll do anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Aya! Oh, Aya... Not my Aya! Ayaaaaaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ungh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>A-Aya... Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Excuse me, sir... Commander Na Zhu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What is it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We've disposed of the majority of the villagers, but our target yet eludes us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Kill the shrine maiden, then. Her ilk poses the greatest threat to our invasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Do that, and I'm sure he'll come running.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Sir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Commander Na Zhu! Someone is approaching from the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>He's here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Come, rise and fight, brethren!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>H-he's alone?! Doesn't he realize he's outnumbered a dozen to one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Like a sword without a blade to bear, ever do I arrive a day after the fair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>M-my word! He's so fast! A-and that look in his eyes... He's like a demon out for blood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Where there is a will, they say, yet I have all but lost my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Wh-who are you?! Identify yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Cry for peace in the depths of hell, yet only demons will heed thine yell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I-it's our target! Prepare yourselves! He's almost upon us. Engage! Engage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Yet in this world, effort reaps reward. Some would yet restore your lost horde.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I-it's him! The former head of Imperial Security! It's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>A life marked by him will not survive the day. One sweep of metal, and their lifeblood will drain away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Aaaaaaarghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>His name is a whisper on the lips of the dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Wait—don't tell me he's...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You dare ask my name?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Yet even in death they invoke his name with dread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You brutes are not worthy of addressing me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Aaaaaarghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Again the curtains rise, it's time for the second act! Down in hell, fire crackles under the sinners' vat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>The would-be samurai has come to cut a swathe through all in his path!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Well, well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Was it you?! Were you the one who took her from me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>This isn't personal. I'm just here to fulfill my duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You reap what you sow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>This is exactly why I left!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Oh? You abandoned your country, your emperor, your ideals, your duty...all because you were sick of spilling blood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Because I wanted to distance myself from death! How does murder serve a country? Killing innocents achieves nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>But you distanced yourself from me, as well. You left me behind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Hrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Come on. Let's go home.</td>
</tr>
