<td>Hah! Found you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh crap! We're done for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wait... Just one? You're all alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Capturing one little bandit chief isn't going to be difficult for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hahahahah! Never would've expected one of you Legion dogs to have the guts to come in here alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Without your troublesome captain around, none of you scare me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I am nothing like Gerald or Vettel, but I chose to walk alongside them all the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Which means that sometimes I'm going to go all out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Quit your babbling! Lads, get her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Damn it! What am I doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I know Natalie better than anyone. It should have been obvious to me what she would do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Surround her! She's a tough one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Of course I am. I'm a member of the Scarlet Legion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(Still, I suppose I have to admit that my plan failed. I was hoping to nab their leader and run back to Gerald, but now I'm outnumbered and surrounded.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No backing out now. Not unless you beg. Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Not going to happen. I'm not a quitter. I wouldn't be caught dead pleading with the likes of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Heh. Keep running your mouth, see where it gets you. I think you'll be changing your tone before long. Try to leave her mostly intact, lads! We want her in working order. Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huzzaaaahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh?! G-Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You idiot! What possessed you to charge in here alone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You're not the only one who can be reckless, you know! But...thanks. I'm glad you're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You... Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Curses! Why'd that monster of a captain have to show up?! But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We still outnumber you! Nothing's changed! Hahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hmph. I can take all of you on myself without breaking a sweat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And that's how it should be.</td>
