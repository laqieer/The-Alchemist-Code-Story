<td>001</td>
<td>Thankfully...</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The old me no longer exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>After the battle following my escape from the prison, Vier used her Phantom arts to disguise one of the soldier's bodies as my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>A few days later, a small article appeared in the Babel Continental Times quietly announcing that a small riot in Wratharis had been quashed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>In other words, the color that was once my identity disappeared as cleanly from the face of this world as if it had never existed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is Kuro. A Beast Shadow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Kuro. Say, "Nice to meet you."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>May I pet her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sieba. You should be in bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's been days since you received the power from another dimension. Getting used to it takes time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You still look worn out from the whole experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I could say the same thing to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sol said I needed to rest before I took another mission. Even though I'm completely fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Can I see Kuro?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>She's very cute, although she can be a bit moody.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Kuro... Yes, your name is Kuro. We're the same color, aren't we? You and I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>She's beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Kuro is very strong. So am I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I want you to remember...just how strong we are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Soon we'll be gone. I hope you will remember us even after we are no longer here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>He will take on this power after we are done. That clumsy man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So, if you don't mind, when he comes...remain by his side. Be kind to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>He's just as moody as I am, but I hope you will remain with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>He must be someone very important to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Now you know what is most important to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Don't forget it. So long as you don't forget it, it's never truly gone. I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I...! I think...you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Am I...talking too much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Not at all. I learned a lot from you just now. I almost feel like you're my older sister or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>S-sister...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, I'm number seven of this little family we call the Templars, and you're number two. You came first, so that makes you basically my older sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>S-sister...? But I think you're more mature than me, Sieba. You know...bigger in some places...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Heheh...heheheh...hee hee hee... Oh, please. Do go on! No need to hold back. Lavish me with praise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It doesn't look like it, but you're even bigger than Füry...in certain places.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I am! It doesn't look like it, but I really, really am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I wish I could grow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You will! Of course you'll grow, and one day—oh! I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I-I'm so sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I will get bigger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>B-but you said—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm going to be that muscle-brain's strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I will never forget you, Zwei. Never.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Thank you! Like I said, I learned a lot from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Zwei?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Sol. No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Wh-what is it? What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I have to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Wait! Don't go! Tell me what happened!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>We only need three more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Now that Sieba has joined the fold, we have seven of our ten Templars. It won't be long before we have filled our ranks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Which means that it's only a matter of time before we set out into the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Cat got your tongue?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Will you not value life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Each of us are blessed with only one. War is a fool's errand that results in such a pitiful loss of life. So many lives would be stolen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Picking a fight with the world is nothing less than a suicide mission. Even if, by some miracle, we were to succeed, there would hardly be anyone to commend us for our deed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Fair enough, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Humans eat other creatures, thus ending those lives to sustain their own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It's human nature to lengthen one's own life by robbing other creatures of theirs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Life itself has no value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Eating a delicious dish is innocuous enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Before it gets cold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>However, once eaten, it is gone forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>The completeness of will and faith—the refusal to bend to another's will—is what truly ought to be valued in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Hahah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>This is why I like you, Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Well, I don't like you one bit. You disgust me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You wish to overturn that which is deemed right through the power of belief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Therein lies your mistake. You blunder even as you proceed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>A mistake led to me being abandoned. If that can be seen as "right" to some...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Then I am more than happy to be "wrong". I'll make the whole world wrong if I have to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Oho...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Have I inspired you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You have inspired something in me, my fellow. Something...that cries for blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Zwei...?! What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Won't let you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I knew it. I knew it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You're a terrible human being!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I don't recall ever having denied that accusation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Uaaaaaarrghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Sol! Zwei! Drei! What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Sieba...! Stay...away...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You know...I really want to create a bouquet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Then make one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I want to arrange the flowers...build them up...and then snap them off myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Dote on the seeds, water them, let them sprout. Select those which stand proud among their fellows, prune them, harvest them...devour them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Sol... Just before your beliefs, so strong and true, come to fruition; just when you begin to feel hope for what you perceive as your future and glow more brightly than anything... That is when I will harvest you. I am going to snap you off at the stem while you are still fresh and raw!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Right...now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>The organization known as the Templars is but three paces away from completion. The flower that has bloomed under my care is blossoming. Nothing could bring me greater joy than this moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>That explains the name...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I didn't think... I mean, who the hell names themselves after the land known for betrayal?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I am honest to a fault. You could say I warned you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Drei... There are three reasons why I welcomed you into the Templars with little argument.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Firstly, because you provided me with the opportunity to recruit our seventh member.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>M-me...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Your personage, uncouth as it may have been, took shape before my very eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>You exposed yourself to danger after danger for such trifles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>T-trifles?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Just when I thought you had begun to blossom, your petals began to wither. If your color continues to fade like this, you will be entirely unworthy of appreciation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Wh-what the hell...are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I can't stand to look at you anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Sieba!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>You never did learn when to quit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>So you...lied to me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>There is no lie here. I wanted to see what blossom you would bloom into. I long to see your petals fall at the moment of your death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>For this, I have watered you. Gently...and with care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>You cannot imagine my disappointment when the moment you obtained absolute power...your spark died out. Fizzled into nothingness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I didn't mean to. I didn't want to! I wanted to keep it, but I threw it all away for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I wanted to show you my truest self, but I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>You are no longer worthy of being an appetizer, let alone a flower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>You are lower than a weed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>You're mine! I can do whatever I want with you and all my loot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Don't throw me away! This is the real me! I'm shining now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I'm shining for you, right here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Don't go! Please don't go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Kuro.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Huuzzzzaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Zwei! That's enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Haa...haa...! I can't die yet! Don't let him kill me! Not until he is here...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I will stop him! You can still...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>The way you attempt to hold back oblivion even as it crushes your spine... Such strength! I just can't get enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I'm not that capable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>You know, I still don't think there's a scrap of value in all that stuff you spouted about the value of life, but that doesn't mean I want to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>And you're wrong. It's not about strength. Only discipline can make one strong enough to carry that weight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>I knew you smelled fishy. Ugh, you stink.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I never needed a horoscope to tell me that you're a traitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>You see, Sol?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>As for the second reason why I allowed you to join the Templars...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>That would be because Zwei was grateful to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Ahh, yes. I believe I have more than compensated for my betrayal on that count.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>The third reason...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>I thought you were a decent human being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Oho? Well, well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>There's never been an opportunity for me to use the full range of my powers before now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>You're the perfect target for me to see what these powers from the other dimension are capable of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>How does it feel to be the one on the other end of an experiment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Honestly? I can't get enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Sieba...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Come on. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>That's enough dilly-dallying for now. Let's just get to the fighting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>D-dilly-dallying...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>I-I'm the older sister, right? Well, consider this an order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>A-all right. I'm with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>I must cull a few rotten weeds... All so that I may pluck you from their midst, Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>If there is to be a test, then let us commence it now!</td>
</tr>
