<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>And you alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>And you said...my mother took you in? This is all so sudden!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's why I'd like to speak with you right away. We must fight together, so that we may bring peace to Wadatsumi once more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well, it seems Monzein's words were no exaggeration. You came for your roots and your destiny...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Th-this is much more than I bargained for, though! I'm not sure how to feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I imagine it's a lot to take in. I'd like to know more about you as well. But I think our first order of business should be to explain the reason you've been summoned here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I need to tell you of the ties that were created in this place, the Malice that would destroy them, and the Wadatsumi royal blood that flows through your veins...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Not to mention the details of the Blade Fox...and about your mother, and the reason I've been searching for you in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Logi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I understand how sudden this all is. And I know it's difficult to believe. But I hope you can see the sincerity in my face. Everything I've said is the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I... Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I don't expect any part of this will be easily explained. But the fact is, we need you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We need your power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is something the matter, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...No, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Will you lend us your strength?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So it was you, Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Judius!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I must say, I'm impressed you were able to take the Mikaboshi when it was so heavily guarded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Unfortunately, it is my prerogative that all variables must be eliminated. So I will be taking it back with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And all of you will die here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh, what do you know? He's every bit the supervillain you made him out to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You don't really think you can beat all of us, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, I don't think that at all. I know I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Heh. The sad thing is, you actually believe that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Logi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm still not sure what to think, exactly. But it doesn't matter. You're in need of my help right now, and I intend to provide it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's my only reason to fight alongside you at the moment, but you can rest assured I'll fight with you till this battle is won, and then we can figure out where to go from there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I hope that's not a problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Of course not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Logi Crowley... Son of the Blood Wolf Zeke, and Celis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>All variables shall be eliminated. This place is to be your grave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Shouldn't your attention be elsewhere?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Blade Fox Corps Second Squad Captain, Ugachi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Well done, Captain Ugachi! Perceptive as ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I never let an opening go without jumping in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Still swinging a sword, I see, despite your obvious...disadvantage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I couldn't face my fallen allies again if I gave up the fight just for losing an arm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's what I'm talkin' about! You got the passion, man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>And what are you supposed to be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I'm Edgar L. Leonhart. I came to Wadatsumi to help a friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Leonhart?! Oh, dear. The variables just keep piling up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Spiritbonding, too?! So you're a descendant of the Sephira?! This just keeps getting more and more aggravating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>So. Many. Variables! Rrraaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Edgar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I hate variables! The future cannot be so random! Everything should work out as planned! All variables are to be eliminated!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Every. Last. One!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Ghah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What do you think you're doing? Out of my way, little one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You're not eliminating anything! We will not allow you to use Wadatsumi as your plaything anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>All is for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>How dare you! How many innocent people have died because of your evil machinations?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It is only natural for the weak to be stamped down. I've turned their meaningless existences into meaningful deaths. No doubt they're thanking me from the great beyond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Nothing I've done is worthy of anyone's hatred or disdain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The strong tread upon the weak. This is a fundamental rule of our world. And no one gets to decide that they don't play by the rules!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>The best you can do is hope for me to turn your death into something with meaning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You fiend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I won't allow people to be abused anymore. I cannot abide any further pain and sadness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We will protect Wadatsumi from your Malice to the very end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Rraaaaaaghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>How can he still be standing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Is that the best you can do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Wait! Stop! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>New plan. I have an understanding of your strength now, and intend to use that to my advantage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I think I'll have you fight each other like I intended from the start!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What are you babbling about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Now that I've confirmed the location of the Mikaboshi, I can take it back whenever I wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Obtaining maximal results with minimal effort is another virtue I've come to know over the course of my tireless research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>And the outcome of that research is quite conclusive. There is nothing you can do to offset the results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Incredible. He didn't even flinch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>And on top of that, he pays no mind to the people he hurts, nor to the evil he spreads...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>So am I to assume this is the man you wish for me to join the fight against?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Our true enemy is a demon known as Malice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>We do not aim to eradicate the demons, but the Malice that fuels themâ€”the Malice that stamps down all in its path with impunity, to achieve its own ends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>It is Malice with a capital M, far better suited to the distinction of demon than those we typically label as such. Much like Judius here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>That willingness to inflict pain on others to achieve one's own goals is the reason Wadatsumi has fallen as far as it has.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>That is the terrible and insidious enemy we face here. Even knowing this, will you still lend us your strength, Logi Crowley?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>It is only natural for the weak to be stamped down. I've turned their meaningless existences into meaningful deaths. No doubt they're thanking me from the great beyond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Nothing I've done is worthy of anyone's hatred or disdain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I have heard your pleas, and though I have yet to fully comprehend everything that's happened, my course is clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I absolutely wish to help you defend this land... This land my ancestors and my mother fought to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>The blood that flows through my veins was born of that desire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I don't yet know how I can help. But whatever it is I can do, I will do it. I promise you that, Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Thank you, Logi Crowley!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>You needn't be so stiff as to use my full name with every address. Logi alone is fine. So, what's the plan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>The Blade Fox has been anxiously awaiting your arrival. I believe your first order of business can be found in Castle Aquila Rubrum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>There's something there which only you can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Learn the sacred art of Kagutsuchi, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I shall guide you. Come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Excuse me, Logi? I'd like to request to break rank here and pursue a separate task on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Kamui? Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I've been sensing a strange energy since our arrival. I can't quite describe it, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I have a feeling that something related to my own destiny may be waiting for me here in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I'd like to follow this lead and see where it takes me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>All right. But at least allow the Blue Tongues toâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>There's no need to worry. I won't get in your way. Or are you more concerned about me going alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Ah, no, of course not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Then I shall take my leave here. Thank you very much. I will return, safe and sound. You have my word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Do you have any idea what he might be sensing, Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I'm afraid not. Could there be even more we don't know about Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>There's no time to ponder that now. We have a lot to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Yes, Captain! Come, Logi. We begin our journey to the stronghold of the royal family of Wadatsumi:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Castle Aquila Rubrum.</td>
</tr>
