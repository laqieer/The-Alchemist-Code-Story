<td>So you, too, have awakened to a new dimension of battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Grk! What is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Proof that a fool remains a fool. To think you would show me all that you are capable of, and so soon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Did you forget? I myself have transcended the limits of this world, having been bathed in an abyss of everlasting darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The...power of darkness!</td>

<td>008</td>
<td>...!</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wife and daughter...?</td>

<td>Before embarking on whatever this is, this man believed in the Door of Truth.</td>

<td>He believed that his wife and daughter, who were lost during war, would be waiting beyond it.</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Silence!</td>

<td>People naturally wish to protect others from the pain they have experienced themselves... In other words...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Indeed. This man once aspired to put an end to the wars with his own sword. Looking at him now that he has fallen so far, you may not be able to imagine it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Be quiet!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I had forgotten who I was, but...</td>

<td>While I was sunk into a world of darkness so overwhelming that I could never have imagined it, my mind churned with such negative emotions.</td>

<td>Oh no! If he unleashes that power, it will drag all of us down with it!</td>

<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Agh...ahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Lord Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Taste defeat and know true regret! This is your end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Everyone, run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>

<td>Your strength is indeed impressive. I did not expect something like this from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I recognize that you are not the Zahar that I remember. However, I...</td>

<td>...Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Lord Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I did not think there was anyone who could challenge Zehn in a sword fight. Who in the world is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The Veda Templars?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ah, the Lord Commander Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Sorry about this. You're something of a thorn in Sol's side, so we're here to take care of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>W-we're surrounded?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ngh... Not even enough honor to do the deed yourself, Zehn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Acht... Neun... What are...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Sol will be here at any moment. We can't waste any more time. Ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>This looks really bad...</td>
