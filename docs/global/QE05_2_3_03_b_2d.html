<td>A trap?!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Your conceit in believing your alchemy would help you come out on top in any situation, has become the cause of your downfall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We, the Sephira, have a thorough knowledge of alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Though we may not be able to wield alchemy, we know plenty of methods to neutralize it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Kill me already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No. You will live. You still have information we need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What makes you think I will talk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Whether you divulge information to us or not is irrelevant. You have already served your purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That we Fruit Peddlers were able to defeat a special ops team from the Holy Guard... That fact alone is valuable knowledge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Even if you lot are nothing more than traitors who defected to Gluttony as loyal followers of Ceclidis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You mean to tell me you pitched a battle and captured us...only as a warning to other organizations?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's exactly what we did. Take them away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What just happened...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sorry to get you involved, but there is something you should know if you consider yourself to be a noble of the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We may have lost almost all of our abilities, but our blood is still strongly attuned to the use of Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Those who have been quietly watching us from the shadows have recently emerged, hunting us down to take advantage of our blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Is that why Mother wanted me to stop pursuing my heritage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Most likely. There is no need for those without the sephirah to be targeted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It would be inadvisable for we, the hunted, to lend you our aid; both for your safety and for the sake of your cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That is why we cannot walk the same path as you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I...understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So this is goodbye. Though we may be following different paths, I pray that hope will light your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Someday...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Someday, I will help bring vitality back to the desert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I believe this will bring the people of this country together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This country will eventually be a place where people can smile and be happy, from the bottom of their hearts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I hope you are right.</td>
