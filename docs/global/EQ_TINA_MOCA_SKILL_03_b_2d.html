<td>Gyaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We did it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Mocca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wh-whoa! Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You really are amazing, Mocca! I'm so proud to be your friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Th-thank you, Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hm? Mocca, you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I never noticed because of your big overcoat, but you're really skinny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wh-what are you talking about? Sheesh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You're so pretty, too... What a waste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm not pretty! Sh-shut up. I...I'm not used to people saying stuff like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I don't think that's true, but... You know, it would be okay to show off a bit more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Like I said, I'm not used to showing so much skin. Ugh, this is embarrassing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I only took it off because I had to, to win. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Really? Well, you'll get used to it with time, but... More importantly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm sorry about earlier. I guess the heat and the troubles of travelling got to me. I got irritated over something stupid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No, I'm the one who should apologize. I'm sorry, Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Until we manage to cure your curse, I'll be there to support you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So, until then, may I stay by your side?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If you would... I'd like for you to stay, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Thank you, Mocca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I've been saved by you, once again. It seems that you're always saving me from something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's not true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It is. This is inexcusable. I can't go on this way. I need to pay you back somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Whatever you want, just say it. I'll give you a portion of my food, or I'll cut down the amount of water I use... At least, I'll try...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This is so sudden... I don't know... Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Did you think of something? Don't hold back. Let me hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Just one time...can you try saying something girly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I want to hear it! You're the one who said I could have anything I wanted, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I mean, yeah, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm sure my friend wouldn't break her promise to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>U-urghh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well, Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I...er... Well, deary...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You can do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Argh! I can't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Heh, heh. You're so cute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Stop teasing me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Who's teasing? I just thought it would be cute to see you all cutesy for once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Mocca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Let's go, Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(I'm going to keep working to support you.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(I know that if we're together, we can overcome anything, and I know we can find a cure for your curse.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(Once we do, let's go home together to the land we protected together; to Saga.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(It would be nice...if we could stay together then, too.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hey, wait up, Mocca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(I want to stay with my precious friend, together forever!)</td>
