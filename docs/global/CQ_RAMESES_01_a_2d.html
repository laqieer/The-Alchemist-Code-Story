<td>Who's there?!</td>

<td>005</td>
<td>Ramses, I need to ask you for a favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...Is that you, Scheherazade? What are you doing here in my manor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>When I came here to leave a message for you, your maid told me that you were training. She led me here to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I-I was choosing which nightclothes to wear! I wasn't training this late at night!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Never mind that. Look at this, Ramses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What do you mean "never mind that"...whoa! What beauty! The paint is glowing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Right? It's beautiful, isn't it? But this is all I have left...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I see. So, you wish to rely on my assistance. However, if you came here to consult about which trader to purchase it from, you'll have to wait until tomorrow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ramses, please, come with me now! In order to complete my painting, I need a considerable amount of this paint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Now?! This has nothing to do with me! It's late. Go home and sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But, Ramses...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Screeech!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What is it now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh? You seem to get many late-night visitors at your manor, Ramses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What are you talking about?! Isn't that a monster?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh, come to think of it, that paint is made from a special mineral.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It contains plenty of that Alchemia that monsters love so much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...So, the monster is after this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Screeech!</td>
