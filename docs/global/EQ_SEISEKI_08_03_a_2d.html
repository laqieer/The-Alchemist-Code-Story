<td>I am Fung Liu. I am what you call...a completed version of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>A completed version of them? In other words...you're also an enemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No...hold on a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ugh...gh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh...?! He took out those immortal soldiers?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If they belong to Greed Dike's army, I don't know why you took them out. What are your intentions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>My intentions? You could say I am here as relief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>As relief?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Due to long experiments, they've lost their own will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Now they've been utilized as weapons without any choice of their own. There's nothing more pitiful than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So you give these immortal beings their death? Is that what you mean by relief?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Chloe, don't let your guard down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Enough...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Aim for its forehead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Let's end it now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There's no point to this. Fighting like this with no will of your own. All it does is give birth to more sadness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I removed the Philosopher's Stone imbedded in its forehead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>They're not immortal. They are just being manipulated by those who wield Philosopher's Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Philosopher's Stones! I see. They're being controlled by Alchemy energy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Victor, contact all divisions. If they destroy the Philosopher's Stone in their forehead, they'll be able to stop their movements. Hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Y-yes, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Thank you for the valuable information. Your advice may very well change the tide of this war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Like I said before...my purpose is to give them relief. You do not need to thank me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wh-what is that pillar of fire?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wh-what the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No way...it can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's the royal castle! Argh... Were they not able to stop Orion's main army?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No...what about the Sacred Stone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That which is responsible for Envylia's Sacred Stone Leviathan is jealousy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>As you well know, its fate has always continued to align with that of the royal lineage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>When it is pulled apart from the royal family, Leviathan is said to become jealous. I've heard such stories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>In other words, the Sacred Stone exists where the king is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Because of its nature, its location is more likely known than the Sacred Stones of the other six major countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That is why Greed Dike went after Envylia before anywhere else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If the king were to fall into the hands of Orion...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No...no matter what happens, the Blue Flame Guard will protect the king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The Blue Flame Guard...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It is the counterpart to the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>As opposed to us who function outside of the jurisdiction of our country in the case of emergencies...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Their duty is that of protecting the king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Is my friend Dilga there as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes, I sent him to support the Blue Flame Guard. Protecting the king inevitably leads to protecting Leviathan as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>More importantly, it's the highest priority. Don't worry...he will do everything he can to protect the king even at the detriment of his own life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That being said...look at that pillar of fire! Captain Vettel, we should head to the royal castle too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No! Our mission is to protect the citizens from Greed Dike! I will not allow you to leave this place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The Blue Flame Guard believe that we'll fight off Greed Dike's army!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We must believe that they will be able to protect the king!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Don't worry. We'll go check on how things are over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Captain Vettel, would that be all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Of course. My apologies. You do me a service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Don't get all formal on me. Hey, ex-spy, this is an emergency. I'll allow you to accompany me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I told you before. I don't take orders from you. Even if you were to reject me, I would still head to the castle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You...! Once we're done with all this, I'll knock some manners into you! Remember that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>This doesn't look good. From the tracks left behind, it seems like they passed more than half a day ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Judging by their pace, they seem to be advancing forward. Let's hurry a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Understood. Um... Was what Captain Yauras saying true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>About declaring war on the Lion Monarch Orion... If that's true...that's a huge responsibility...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>No, no, no, no. Not at all. Who would take that seriously and act upon it with their entire country?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Take it seriously...? So you actually did do it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>N-no...well, um...it was sort of a tit-for-tat kind of thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Kind of thing? Seriously That's really bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Seeing from the way they acted at a time like this, it's hard to believe it didn't have any effect whatsoever...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You want to know why they chose to act now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>If that's the case, I have a general idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Most likely, it's because Captain Kudan was taken out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>It's because Orion was devoted to Captain Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I'm sure he was convinced he would bring down the balance of power in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>By adjusting the balance of power in this world, he would bring about peace. However, Captain Kudan was killed...and the Mikaboshi vanished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Furthermore...Captain Kudan was supposed to be his catalyst and Kanon took him out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>There was nothing left to stop Orion's ambitions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I'm sure he was convinced of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I don't think Greed Dike suddenly sprang into action. I think they're finally acting out a long-awaited plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>To be honest...none of that matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Kanon said not to mix emotions into all of this...but I can't do that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>After all, my entire homeland was robbed from me because of the Mikaboshi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Yes, of course. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>But...what?! How can I help it! It's how I feel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>No, that's not what I meant. Do you really think that's the only reason why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>People think that they destroyed Wadatsumi to expand their territory and influence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>However, the fact of the matter is, they were aiming to get the Mikaboshi. That's the truth of the matter, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>But...because they couldn't get the Mikaboshi, do you think it's normal to go so far as to destroy the entire country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What are you saying? That's exactly what they did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I know...but maybe...there was some other reason why they destroyed Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>No...maybe I shouldn't talk about this. After all, it's just in the realm of speculation. I'm sorry for saying too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Don't be. In any case, I won't forgive Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Mm...well, I guess it's fine if it fuels your passion. More importantly...this is all a little dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Are you still afraid of being captured? Don't worry, they won't strip you naked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Hey...let's forget about that, shall we?! That's not what I'm talking about. Look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>There's smoke rising!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>It's coming from near the castle of Lustburg...let's hurry, Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
