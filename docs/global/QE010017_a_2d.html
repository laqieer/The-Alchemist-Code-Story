<td>Twenty years ago, I killed that man in the great battle that destroyed Wratharis.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What? You killed him? But, he was just right in front of us.</td>

<td>It's Alchemy. Sabareta is transmuting the souls of the dead and controlling them.</td>

<td>No way... And that's the power you two have as well?! Father!</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well... I was wondering if what Caesar said was true. That, well, you killed defenseless people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I told you—if your heart is not strong enough, the power will consume you. I fell under the power's control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I convinced myself that my actions would lead to peace.</td>

<td>Then—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I've no intention of hiding what happened. When the time is right, I'll tell you about it. Let's go.</td>
