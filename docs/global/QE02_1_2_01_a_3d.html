<td>I'm blown away... The glimmering neon lights are too much for my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>High-end clubs, casinos, and...whoa...even those kinds of places! This is amazing. I've never visited such a massive entertainment district before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Aye, this is Little Heaven, Slothstein's greatest entertainment district.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Rumor has it that the Don Taras Family has a mansion somewhere in this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>To think that Fiona is somewhere in this filthy place is almost enough to fry my circuits, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Seriously, even the women walking down the street are excessively elegant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Are you listening to me, aye?! Now isn't the time for indecent thoughts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>D-don't be stupid. Of course, I know that! It's not like I was getting my hopes up or anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Actually, when you look closely, there are also a lot of oddly shabby people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Aye, hidden behind Little Heaven lies the slums of Real Heaven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Those inhabitants are here seeking alms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Real Heaven lies hidden behind Little Heaven?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>In other words, the true reality of the city named Heaven is the slums that lie hidden behind it. How ironic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Aye, humans never cease to amaze me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Anyway, the Don Taras Family mansion is said to be located in the center of Real Heaven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Said to be? That's not very reliable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Aye, the details of this area haven't been laid out on any map.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>A city that doesn't exist on the maps, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>In places like that are where the real image of the country emerges.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Whoops. My bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Jeez. There are a lot of bad guys around here. You better watch where you're running, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Okay! Sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So you're just gonna let him go, aye?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Of course. Listen, Alkemono...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Looking down on someone just because they're a child is a disgraceful thing for any adult to do. Remember that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You gunslingers are a generous lot—even willing to remain silent when you get pickpocketed, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hah. Well, generous is overstating things a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If I got agitated every time I was pickpocketed, I wouldn't be...wait, what did you just say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huff...huff...heh. Foreigners are the easiest...huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Finally found you, aye! It was no easy task!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ehem. Well. Let me tell you this as an adult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Being a thief is a blatant crime. You better reconsider your actions—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Look, I don't have all day. Can you get to the point?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Give me back my fortune, you punk!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So much for your generosity, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Your fortune?! No way. That's all you have?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>My head is swirling with indescribable emotions right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ack! I've got more important things to deal with! Hurry up and give it back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hey! Let me go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh? Hold on a second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What! Argh... I can't deal with idiots like you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ouch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ron Shubert, 11-year-old resident of Real Heaven with multiple thefts and petty criminal records.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>A Guard Droid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The sum of money you currently possess places the probability of theft at 85%.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Estimated from your current heart rate and criminal record, I have determined you should be restrained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wh-wha...! Hey! Let me go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huh? What's a Guard Droid?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Alkaroids deployed by Alvarez to maintain security, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Their excessive enforcement has been problematic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Le-let me go! I need this money to buy my mom's medicine! Come on, let me go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Let him go. I gave the boy that wallet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh? Wh-what are you playing at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'm stating the facts. Let the boy go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I cannot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What? Why? I'm the owner of that wallet, and I'm telling you to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Estimating from the gun in your possession, you are a gunslinger. The contents of the wallet are far too little for someone of your profession.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>In comparison to the average income of a gunslinger, there is a 4% probability that the money belongs to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I think I'm gonna vomit out of embarrassment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Furthermore, you bear a striking resemblance to Edgar L. Leonhart,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>the suspect guilty of abducting Mayor Alvarez's bride from their wedding. The probability of this is 95%. I will now restrain you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>So, that's how it's gonna be, huh? It makes everything a lot easier! Time to vent all my frustrations!</td>
