<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>It looks like we were able to chase away all the beasts! What a relief! Thank you for helping, Mikoto!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm the one who should be thanking you. I've never done anything like this before...heheh. Today, I'm experiencing a lot of firsts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But that's strange. The bad feeling within the grounds still hasn't dissipated. I wonder if something happened to the barrier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It smells like something big is going on! Hey, Mikoto, you and I, let's solve this puzzle together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Just you and me...? But I can't leave this place...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What?! Why can't you leave here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I've been told by everyone in this shrine that if I leave this place something bad will happen. Huh? What do you mean, Gods?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Um. The Gods are telling me to step outside the shrine. They're saying that as long as I remain within the grounds it's okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So they gave you their permission? Eheheh. All right then. We're the Tama-Miko expedition. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Th-the Tama-Miko expedition?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I-I'm outside the shrine...and without even asking for permission. I've been outside a few times, but this is the first time I've snuck out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wasn't today one of experiencing a lot of firsts? In that case, let's do a lot of things for the first time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heheh. You're right. When I'm with you, Tamamo, for some reason I feel like I can do everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You can do everything! You can go to lots of different places with me...for example, a festival!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>A festival? You're talking about a ritual, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Not something so rigid and formal. The grounds here are filled with shops selling delicious things to eat! It's a lot of fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I didn't know there were festivals like that! The festivals that I know about are also a lot of fun, and you can talk with a lot of interesting people. Hehe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Talking is fun! But outside of the grounds is filled with a lot more fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>More fun...outside the grounds... But I...huh? So-someone is coming from that direction. We need to hide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's hard to believe that beasts would emerge here! We must quickly determine the reason behind the barrier's instability!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>According to the report, the village has also suffered damage. It looks like we'll have to ask the Shrine Maiden Mikoto for her help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That should be our last resort. We cannot have her shoulder the burden of everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You're right. She is so kind and generous, and...huh?! I hear the voice of beasts coming from that direction! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Phew. It looks like they're gone. What's the matter, Mikoto?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I wonder if everyone is safe in the village...my father...my mother... Tamamo, we need to quickly solve this incident!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes, you're right. I wouldn't want anyone to suffer! Hm? What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That? Oh, that's the barrier around the shrine. Hey, the barrier's seal has been damaged! It's almost as if it were bitten by something...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Does it look like damage inflicted by a fang like this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh? Yes, exactly...eeek! A pack of wolves?! They must be the cause!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I guess we'll have to send these guys back where they came from!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ye-yes!</td>
