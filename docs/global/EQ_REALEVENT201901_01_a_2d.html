<td>U-um, excuse me... I don't mean to bother you while you're working, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huh? Is this about your plans for the 3rd Anniversary TAC Fan Meeting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We're sticking with what we've got planned. We're just gonna express our gratitude to the users for bringing us through three whole years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's not like your ideas were boring or anything, but we just don't need to do anything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I understand. In that case, I'll make the DLC according to the plan we discussed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Thanks. I've got a briefing to get to, so I'll see you later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Haa... I really thought there was something to those plans. I'm sure the fans would've enjoyed them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Numa, numa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Nah... I understand how you feel, but as producer, Imaizumi's word is law.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Numa...</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>——On a certain day in 2019 (FgG Studios)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Today's the day of the 3rd Anniversary TAC Fan Meeting! It's finally here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I can hardly believe it... Three whole years! Thinking back, I'm not sure if it's been a long time coming, or if it all passed by in the blink of an eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hey! It's too early to get all sentimental on us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Right, right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We're only here thanks to the support we've received from the TAC user base! We've gotta show them a good time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's right! Thankfully, we have TAC's Director here to help us out with our strategy this time around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hey, Fujita! Things are proceeding just as planned, I hope?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sure are! I'm being so thorough, I've even had them do a cursory debugging!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Good. I'm a little concerned, but I'm sure things will be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The DLC will be ready shortly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh? Wh-what? Fujita...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>N-no way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What are you getting your whiskers in a knot for? You should know what's going on better than anyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Your idea to add those touches to the strategy wasn't bad. That's why we decided to use it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You got something to say, Gakki? What're you getting all puffed up about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Nothing. This is fine. I just...thought it would be fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Make sure you have a chat with those Worker Rattys later. We don't want them running amok again. Not too much, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>O-oh, yes. Of course. My apologies for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Well, they're going to be the ones on the receiving end this year, at any rate. As usual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>All right! Now, let's rehearse the quest! Director Ratty, your explanation, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Right. Yes. During this quest, the player will receive a buff from, just like last time, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You're taking too long! Fujita, show him how it's done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Got it. The key to this quest is the Rampaging Ratty, thought up by none other than Director Ratty himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>A shortcut to completing the quest is to prevent the Rampaging Ratty from creating the DLC.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes, exactly. The Ratty in question will do all it can to complete the DLC.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>We're going to have the Rattys work themselves to the bone several times over as the bad guys this time around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Gakki will once again serve as the players' ally, helping them put a stop to the Rampaging Ratty. You'd better give it your all, you got that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>L-loud and clear! I'll do everything within my power to cheer on the player!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The other enemies should also have the appearance of being workers, like Worker Rattys, and you'll have to keep them from actually getting to their work stations... This point is particularly important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hmm... Do you think they'll really be able to take down my final form after they've had to deal with a bunch of those worker-types?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I think...I'd like to see that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It'd definitely be a treat to watch them try... Although, it might be a bit tough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hahah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That's right! And let's not forget that Director Ratty has a role to play, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's your punishment for failing to stop the Worker Rattys and for making Gakki all puffed up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huh? What? M-me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Just like last time, you're going to be the coordinator, but you're also going to be on the anti-Rampaging Ratty side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Oooh, that puts him on Gakki's team!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, yeah, but they're both playing bad guys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So, when the Worker Rattys are taken out, and the time comes for the TAC Producer and the other TAC celebs to make their entrance, Director Ratty had best flee, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oh, yes. I wouldn't want the Producer to get angry at me for secretly using buffs on myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hahah... I guess that makes Director Ratty pretty important to this quest too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Yep. He's the character that you aren't sure if you should take down or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Don't forget that if you use certain skills that relate to the special guests, Director Ratty will happily fix things in your favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huh? So... You should use the skills of the one called the Sun of Lost Blue against TAC's Producer, and the skills of the Coquelicot against Director Ratty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yup! You got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I am humbled by the splendid role which you have given me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Looks like we need to amp up Director Ratty's punishment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Understood! I will gladly accept any punishment you decide to give me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Hahah. He's so enthusiastic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>As for the Worker Rattys' punishment... Well, they're already stuck with the role of playing the bad guys year after year. That's bad enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Yeah, I guess that's a lot like being punished regularly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Um... Please hold on a moment. Now that I have been forced to take this fluffy form, I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>The Rattys are hard workers. I don't think they deserve this treatment. They really care about the roles they are given to play, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Don't worry, Director Ratty. We know that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Yup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Heheh, this is perfect. You see, Director, this is the reason why we made the change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>We wanted to show our appreciation for all the hard you and the Worker Rattys do for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>R-really? That makes perfect sense... I'm terribly sorry for my misunderstanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I'm glad to hear it! So, what are you going to do now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>W-well, I will create a revised version of the DLC, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>That's the ticket! I'm counting on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>As for the reward, what we've got down will do just fine, I suppose. You don't think it's too much, do you, Fujita?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Not at all. This is our 3rd Year Anniversary, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I think we should hand out some other Enlightenment items in addition to the usual Lion Sets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Our system is going to be quite a bit different to last time's, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>There're lots of things we have to make happen, and there's plenty more that we'd love to see come to pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>So we'd better make this event a success, no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Speaking of which, Director Ratty... Why hasn't there been a change in your appearance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>H-huh? Well, I was never really human to begin with...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Well, whatever. Anyway, I'm counting on all of you! Don't let me down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Right. Of course. I will do my very best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Numa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Numa, numa! That's right, they're going to use our plan! Ours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Numa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Numaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Numa, numa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>(Huh? Are they actually having a conversation?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Well, we're going to get to work coordinating you-know-what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Numa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Oh, right... Thank you. Good to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Alright, well... Let me once again state that the fact that we have made it all the way to our 3rd Anniversary is thanks in full to all of you who have supported us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>With gratitude we, um... Well, we'll be waiting for all of you (not the Rattys) at the venue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>We hope that you enjoy this event!</td>
