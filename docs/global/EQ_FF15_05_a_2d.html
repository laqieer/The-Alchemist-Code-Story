<td>Something strange is going on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The Magitek Axemen...there's something about them that's slightly different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Agreed. I feel it as well. They're a tad stronger than usual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Those soldiers aren't human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>As you've probably discovered from fighting them, they're cyber soldiers with no human inside them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I've heard that Slothstein has similar cyber soldiers called Alkaroids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hold on. There are cyber soldiers here as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yeah. On top of that, from what I've heard, there are Demons in Slothstein who operate on Alchemic Energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's all I can tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I don't really get it but I'm assuming it's some kind of magic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, I guess you could call it that. Anyway, let's head to Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(Demons...Alkaroids...Magitek Axemen...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(I wonder if it has something to do with the incidents in Slothstein that Gabirond was talking about.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I don't understand the details, but let's hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Dias, you can sit in the passenger seat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...! I'm riding on this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You don't plan to walk, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No...but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hurry up and get in. We're crammed in tight back here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>O-okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Woo! The wind feels great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>All right. Say "cheese"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hmm? It's a camera. Wanna see the photos later?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The city is coming into view.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...What's with all the smoke?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Whoa! Is that the city?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Most likely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You're not sure? Man. The thought of seeing a new city is getting me all worked up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we'll be getting there that easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>These guys again.</td>
