<td>Fraternizing with the enemy is a grave sin indeed. I would have thought you'd know that, having served at my side for as long as you have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It seems that I was mistaken. Take him to the block.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes, Supreme Commander!</td>

<td>S-Supreme Commander! Please! I beg you! Supreme Commander!</td>

<td>Those who betray me will pay with their lives. You should consider yourself lucky to be granted a quick death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>She won't overlook even the smallest act of betrayal, and cuts down even her longest-serving followers without mercy. She's truly terrifying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, I'm impressed that she found out about his, uh, "fraternizing", even though it only happened once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I bet she doesn't trust any of us, not even a smidgen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Tch. Why must everyone cause me trouble?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hm...? There's something outside my window... Ah! Intruder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ooops! You caught me!</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ah!</td>

<td>Identify yourself this instant!</td>

<td>Who, me? I'm Vivi, from Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(She gave up her name that easily?! What is she playing at?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm just out on a little errand and, well, I found myself staring at you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I couldn't help it! You just looked so lonely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Me? Lonely? Tch, don't be ridiculous! Is that all you have to say for yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's it! Right there! That's the face I'm talking about! You know, if you're always so serious and pouty all the time, you won't grow any taller!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'll keep you company if you like.</td>

<td>It is insolent for you to stand before me without a shred of fear, but also...interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Come to think of it...she's always been a strange one, since the time we first met.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>She may be a spy for Wratharis, but she has never shown so much as an inkling of having reported about me to her superiors. Furthermore, she comes and goes from my room without a second thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And I... I accepted all of that. Even though she was a stranger to me—and an informant for a foreign nation at that! But now, I...</td>

<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Supreme Commander of the Greed Dike Navy, Mei Fang... It's time for you to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(Ngh... I can't believe I got so caught up in my thoughts that I fell prey to a surprise attack! How could I be so careless?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(If Vivi is my weakness, then I will cut her out of my life! It's better to trust no one at—)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Mei Fang!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>V-Vivi?! Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Sorry I haven't been able to come around for a while! I was doing this job that was just dragging on and on—but I'm here now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You have some real nerve laying a hand on my friend! You'd better be ready, because you're not going to be getting up after I'm finished with you!</td>
