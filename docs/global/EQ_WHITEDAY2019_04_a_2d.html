<td>005</td>
<td>He's breaking the law!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah, you've both said your piece! Anyway... What're we gonna do now? We've lost sight of those two, thanks to your little argument!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well, Fraise didn't show the slightest sign of weakness the entire time we were watching him, did he? I'd say it's about time you gave up, Gino! Just admit that you were wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmph. Why should I? It's not like you proved that he isn't weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, for the love of...! Now you're just arguing for the sake of it! You really are a petulant child, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What?! Who are you calling a...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You gonna say something, kid? Or just keep clinging?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh! I-I can't believe I didn't notice you there! How long have you been...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>U-um... What can I do for you? Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Unnghh... Nnngh... Mommy! Waaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Woah! Hey, hey, hey! Wh-what should I do?! Oh, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>D-don't ask me! She was stuck on you! She's your problem!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You're the one who noticed her first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Waaah! Waaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Did she get separated from her parents because of that Ratty fiasco? Hey, little girl, can you tell us what your mom looks like?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Waaaaaaahh! Mommy! I want my mommy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Well, this is gonna be tough.</td>

<td>There she is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There, there. We heard you crying from so far away! You did good to call out for your mom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Don't worry. Fraise is bringing her here right now.</td>

<td>There you are! I was worried sick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Mommy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Phew, that was close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hm? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I just can't help but think about how perfect Eve and Fraise are together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm starting to get sick of hearing that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But it's so true! They're an OTP for a reason!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If they get married, I wonder if that's the kind of mother Eve would be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I can see the two of them building such a happy little family together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It'll be so perfect! A true happy ending!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ugh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Getting married isn't always a happy ending.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There are plenty of families plagued by misery. But of course you wouldn't be able to imagine that, would you? Your head is stuck so far up in the damn clouds that all you see are fantasies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>A man who weakens himself by falling in love is useless on the battlefield. He either ends up dead, or so miserable that he wishes for death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>And then what happens to the woman who is left behind? Huh? She lives out the rest of her life alone, forlorn and heartbroken. Not to mention the damn children!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hey, come on...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What? I'm just giving her a reality check.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>A part of you has to stay hungry to grow strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Playing it safe after getting married... Abandoning your desires for the sake of your family...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Who could possibly be happy with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Not all families have both parents present. As far as I'm concerned, he's been my only family since I was little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Sure, it's fun for them while it's fresh... But nobody can stay happy once they get married.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What? If you have something to say, then spit it out already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I already know that not all families end up happy. You don't have to tell me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>But... But that's why I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Unnghh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Uhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Moa...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Tch... Why didn't she just say something back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hey! Gino!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What're you just standing there for?! You made her cry! Go after her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Y-yeah, all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I said it was an accident!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Shut up! I'm already having a bad day because of some brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Not to mention my girl getting away! You bumping into me is the last straw!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I'm not exactly having a good day myself. I'm warning you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Aren't they the guys you were fighting with in front of the sweetshop earlier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Yeah, but there're more of them now. Tch... What a pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Moa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Moa, are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Eve...? And Fraise! What are you two doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Who made Moa cry?! I will not forgive you!</td>
