<td>001</td>
<td>So this is what it's like inside the ship that can cross the Barrier. It's even more impressive in person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We don't have time for that! What're we gonna do now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That Cursed Beast is starting to wake up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Nimul, I have ordered the Sephira Guard to begin preparing for battle, as you asked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But...surely...you don't really intend to fight the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No. It's not time for that yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We are going to board the airship and pursue the fleeing Guardian Dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What? Why? The Great Nidhogg has fled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Surely you do not intend to squander Emmel's efforts! She has bought us the time we need to seal the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Emmel did what was necessary to save the Sephira. At the time, that was the right thing to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But at this rate, we're not going to be able to seal Beelzebub...the Cursed Beast of the Gula Belt Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? But... The avatar of that dragon, Asena, or whatever... She gave you her powers, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So if we use thoseâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Matter... The crystallization of the four elemental powers of nature that slept within the Guardian Dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Those powers serve to enhance the purification powers of Sephiron herself. It is thanks to them that we were able to seal the corruption of the Cursed Beast beneath the earth for so many years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>However, the Matter is incomplete. The majority of the dragon's power still sleeps within the beast itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So we have no choice but to go and retrieve the rest of it from the fallen Guardian Dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I suppose that explains why the dragon asked you to slay it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>How are things going on your end, Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Fortunately, my forge on the village outskirts was intact...including all of the arms and armor I left behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>While the hands of the inexperienced may not be able to draw out their true worth, they should serve to supplement our efforts somewhat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Adaleigh. If we start our pursuit now, whereabouts will we be when we catch up with the dragon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, right. Let me see... From the looks of things, I think we can trap it before it reaches the Great Forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Your ship must be fast. I could use one myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>How can you be so flippant at a time like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Waginau... What's got you so angry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Don't be so callous! Our reliance upon the Great Nidhogg is second only to that we lay upon Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yet you talk of slaying it as if it were a common boar! Do you realize how our soldiers' morale is flagging? Do you think the village elders are going to support you after this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It must be done, Waginau, lest the world crumble at our feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Things are already in motion. The world waits for no one. It is far, far too late for us to stop now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ngh... I suppose that this, too, is the way of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Then this destruction... Our destruction... Is this our fate? Are we meant to just accept it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Nimul...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Fate isn't something we are given. It's something we must all carve out with our bare hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You need to understand this, Waginau. Everything in this world is dependent upon our own personal choices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Our choices... I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Nimul, even when faced with a desperate situation like this, you stare resolutely forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yeah, I'm something of an oddity. When everyone is down, I feel like I want to start laughing and never stop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You're strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I simply have faith that anything is possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Lord Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What is it? Did something happen to Emmel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No, she's still sound asleep, my lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Tell me what happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>A large number of Fallen have appeared around the temporary shelter where the villagers are taking refuge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The guards are doing what they can to hold them back, but these Fallen are far more powerful than any we have encountered before. Perhaps the awakening of the Cursed Beast has something to do with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Alright. We need to get them to safety. Waginau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ready when you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Adaleigh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hold on! I'll be back in a sec. I've just gotta go mobilize the Engineer Soldiers I've got in the hanger...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I have been working on creating arms that can combat the corruption for some time now... This is an excellent opportunity for me to test them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Good. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
