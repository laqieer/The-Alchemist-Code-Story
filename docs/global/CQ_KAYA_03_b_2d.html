<td>001</td>
<td>As expected of the Alchemia Pura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You are certainly no slouch either. The average person wouldn't be able to tell that you'd just gotten finished training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This is more difficult than I expected... It is regrettable that Zain did not push you a little harder while training with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I haven't seen you like this in a long time. Why the sudden change?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Why are you willing to risk your life to continue your research?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>For one, pure curiosity. Second, the same reason that you risk your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And that is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I want to support the Lord Commander... Help Zain just like you do. But in my own way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You've helped me realize that there's something that only I can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Learning from history leads to a deeper understanding of both Alchemy and our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I believe that will be a great service to the Holy Guard and the Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And that's something both Zain and I aren't capable of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Zain only looks forward. You have your own darkness to face. This... This, I can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There is no future without history. And yet our history is missing pieces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>By filling those blanks, Zain can build a brighter future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I believe I'm better suited for work like that more than anyone else in the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Everyone should do what is best suited to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Zain's role is to keep moving forward and protecting absolute justice. Mine is to work behind him, rooting out corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And my role is to watch both of your backs, seeking the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Everything in its right place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Very me, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I want you to promise me one thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>In the event that something happens to you after diving into the darkness of this world, make sure there is someone to take your place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>As a Captain, that is my request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I understand. I promise. Though I must say I believe I have already been doing so, even without your request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Shall we call this a tie now that you've sheathed your sword? I take it I'll be allowed to continue my research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes. You've shown me your passion. I have nothing left to say on the matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Just...don't overdo it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I could say the same to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Still, I never thought I'd hear you talk that way about Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You and me both... I never thought myself capable of something like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>And you still agreed to my condition? Well, let's do what we can for Zain. Together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Making silly promises... It really isn't like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But I suppose it happens.</td>
