<td>001</td>
<td>Where is that peddler? No sign of them yet. Maybe I should keep going...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wait… Who's that over there? Oh… Just a couple of kids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hurry up, sis, or they'll sell out before we get there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's my mission to buy one for everyone in our family this year, and I don't wanna miss out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I know, but you can't just run off on your own! Hold my hand, okay? We'll make it there together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm not a little kid, you know! I don't need your help with every little thing anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Heh... That's such a little kid thing to say. I should know—I used to be like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>And Glanz always played the part of the big sister, worrying about me and stuff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I wonder if they'll really be there? At the party, I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I know they were invited, but after the way we left things last time...I wouldn't be surprised if they opted out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>They were just trying to help me, and I threw their good intentions back in their faces. I yelled at them, said some awful things...and I didn't even apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And after all that...have I even done right by the Unicorn Knights?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A place for girls who have nowhere else left to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's what the Unicorn Knights are all about, but I'm not sure I've upheld that reputation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It kind of feels like all I've done since I became captain is fight in their...in Glanz and Rochelle's stead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I can't face them now! Not yet. Not until I've become someone who can restore smiles to the faces of those around me and keep them there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Aha! Found you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Icona! What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I just thought I'd join you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Join me? But you said it wasn't even my place to do this! What changed your mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Don't tell me you suddenly developed a soft spot for kids?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Haha. Nope! Mini humans and their emotions aren't my concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I figured. But then...why are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I need a few components for my machines, and I heard there might be some I can salvage nearby.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Besides, it's better to deal with problems sooner rather than later. Makes life easier in the long run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So, by accompanying you on your little mission—illogical and inefficient as it may be—I can help ensure that any hiccups are dealt with the second they pop up, thus saving future me a headache.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Geez... You sure love the sound of your own voice, don't you? Listen, I can handle this on my own, so why don't you just—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Slim as it may be, there is a chance something could go wrong if you're alone. That would impact future missions, robbing me of precious research time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So! How about we stop arguing, and start finding that peddler?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ugh... Fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>However...was there really any need for us to get involved in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>This again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Issues between buyer and seller belong in the marketplace. They're not for us to settle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Maybe, but...like I said, that guy was in a really foul mood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'd hate to see him ruin the Winter Holiday for his kids. This is meant to be a happy day, a time to laugh and have fun with your loved ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I suppose that is the theme of the day, although I confess I don't understand it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What's there to understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Everything is more fun when you do it with friends or the people you love, right? Even stuff like going swimming, or learning new things...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Y-yeah? I think so. At least...it's always been that way for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That's where that saying comes from: time flies when you're having fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But time is finite—I understand that better than most people. That's why it's so important for us to really enjoy the time we have with the people we care about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Wasting a special day like today on being annoyed at somebody is just...sad. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Interesting... So that's what's motivating you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And? Is there something wrong with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I wouldn't say that. I'm well aware that there are a number of people in this world who think like you do, and put the needs of others above their own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I just don't understand them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Well, don't you think that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hang on... Someone's coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>All right, missies, which one of you is the peddler with the exclusive goods?! If you value your life, drop all your valuables and run for the hills!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I knew we'd run into a lowlife like this eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Well, don't just stand there—get ready! We're in for a fight!</td>
</tr>
