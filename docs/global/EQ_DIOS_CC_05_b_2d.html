<td>001</td>
<td>That strength...it's no ordinary monster. We have no choice, but to temporarily fall back...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Get out of my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>With just one blow, he destroyed that monster we were struggling against...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You came at the perfect time. After you take care of all the bandits, clean this up as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Did he take out all the bandits on his own? Wait...no, please a moment, Sir Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Stop following me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>As much as it hurts to admit, his ability with the sword is the real thing. Furthermore, his calmness and stability in dealing with that monster...could Sir Dias be a hero for the ages?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm home, Yuffie...sorry I haven't been back in a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I want to make a more beautiful tomb, not something as simple as this. Just give me a little more time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I must've been getting carried away, having made a new brother and sister. Because of that, I'd forgotten...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The world is a hopelessly distorted place tainted with despair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But don't worry. My eyes are finally open. No longer do I dream some naive fantasy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yuffie, when I come next time, the world will be different. I will create a world of peace where everyone can live happily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Brother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>?! ...You're the child who was caught by the bandits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Um...thank you. This is for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This small, blue flower...is it a begonia? Do you know the language for this flower?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>For this? Um...I think it was "I forgive all."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Forgive...I see. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(...It's a flower far removed from my own life. Yuffie, why this flower...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Thank you for saving that child. May god shine down on you, Sir Paladin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Sir...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Do not pray to god! Prayer will not save anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If you have time to be praying, then work towards obtaining the power to change this twisted world. That is the only thing you need to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>O-okay...understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Who would've thought you'd come home in two days. You also seem quite refreshed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Who knows. So? You obtained some information regarding the Sacred Stones, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That can wait. Rejoice, Dias. You have been officially appointed Captain of the 4th Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Me, a Captain? Well, that's a rather shallow endeavor you've got going there, Gabirond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's pointless to try to use that title to shackle me down. I realized this during my assault on the bandits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I will move on my own. It's more efficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If you become a captain, you will be given command and authority over an entire battalion. It'll become much easier to search for the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That would be one thing if each Paladin equaled in skill to that of Bertrand, but Paladins these days...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Does such a knight even exist?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The Peacekeepers did nothing more than get in my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I much prefer the alternative of searching for the Sacred Stones on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Wait, Dias! Do you think I would allow such insubordination?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Allow? Who is commanding who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What are you saying? I am the commander of the Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I see. Then it's just a matter of switching the head of the Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Gabirond, if you die, the Holy Order will send in a new commander for the Corpse, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>For me, it doesn't matter who it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You take advantage of my power. If so, then make sure you're providing me with enough value that equals this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You can either die here and now, or you can let me remain on my own. As commander of the Corpse, the choice is yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Just don't shirk your period reports.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yeah, I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What's with those eyes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Such emotions as anger, hatred, sadness, impatience, and fear are easy to manipulate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>He was supposed to be a tool that easily expressed such emotions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>However, he was looking at me the way one would look at the gravel on the side of the road. What is going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ack. Something bad may be brewing beneath the surface. Just in case, I'll report to Lord Dario.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Please wait, Sir Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You're from the Peacekeepers... Is there something you want to say to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Your victory over the bandits was highly impressive. We wanted to apologize for our earlier rude remarks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Moving forward, we of the Holy Guard will follow you without hesitation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It appears that we will be joining your troops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Please, we humbly ask that you let us serve as your troops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Sir Dias...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'll act on my own. There is no longer...any whom I trust to have my back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Sir Dias?! Please wait, Sir Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>(What simplistic animals. However, that is the nature of man. To clamor to the power stronger than your own.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>(That is why I must obtain absolute power.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>(Only by ruling with absolute power can the world be changed. I will fulfill the promise that I made them.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>(Agatha...this time I will follow through. I will protect you.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>(Logi...if your naive self were to see me like this, you would look me straight in the eye and try to stop me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>(Yes. You can come at me whenever you want to, but you will never be able to stop me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>(To fix this distorted world...I will gather the Sacred Stones and obtain absolute power!)</td>
</tr>
