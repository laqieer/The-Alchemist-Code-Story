<td>Excuse me?</td>

<tr>
<td>031</td>

<td>Oh, uh.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Azami, you should yield more of yourself to your comrades. Allow them to cover your back. You must do so to your opponent, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>To my opponent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yes. Yield to their movements and you will be able to prevent or parry their strikes with smooth, fluid motions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Try not to be so obstinate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The hands that grip your weapon, those mouths that talk back, and the brains that you need to keep coming up with half-baked ideas... All of those are made of the meals you eat.</td>

<td>If you do not eat, you will have no strength to even lift a finger. Do you understand?</td>

<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Life is nothing if you don't live it, and food is what keeps you alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>277</td>
<td>So, to insult food is to insult life.</td>

<td>All right!</td>

<td>All of your dishes are my favorites, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Oh, I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>So what did you make?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>A lot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life.</td>

<td>What?!</td>

<td>Azami!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Move! Get out of my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Azami!!!</td>

<td>Gaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Azami, stop! No... Please! Azami!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>We're supposed to vanquish all demons who bring pain and suffering, remember?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>We swore to bring about blissful days of joy! Don't you remember?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>We said that with our blades, we will clear the way for Wadatsumi's future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>We swore it together, Azami!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Don't say it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>"Kill me."</td>

<tr>
<td>275</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Please...! Don't say such a thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Fate cannot be overturned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Y-you again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>None can turn falsity into truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>If one's hopes are severed without ever knowing the truth, then one will travel down a path far different from what they were meant for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Hopes...severed...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Indeed. Even I cannot measure the impact such a thing would have upon this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Is that why you're here, talking to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Do you or do you not seek the true path?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Will you live a life of falsehood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Or will you choose death?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Death...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Without fulfilling my oath?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>That is indeed an option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>An empty fate in which you are destined to fade without reaching the truth. A life which will end without ever seeing the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>It is your choice to make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I... I choose to see the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Then I shall observe every aspect of the choice you make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Now, child molded by the land of sin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Show me the answer the truth guides you to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Amane, I still see hesitation in your blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Observe your opponent and read their intentions as though you are them. Then end them with one deadly strike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Okay.</td>

<td>Azami, you should yield more of yourself to your comrades. Allow them to cover your back. You must do so to your opponent, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>276</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I...choose to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Live and clear the way for Wadatsumi's future...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>With our blades...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>With our... Our...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Celis... Azami...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Hnngh... Nnnh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Whaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Aaaahh! Waaaaaaaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>A long, long time ago...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Humans and demons fought one another, and both were desperate to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Demons devoured humans in order to live, and humans killed them so that they would not be devoured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>In the end, sadness and hatred enveloped Wadatsumi like a shroud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>D-demon! Run! Demons are here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>As the battles raged on, humans and demons quickly became consumed by their hatred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Amidst the chaos, a lone human man and a lone demon woman overcame their differences and fell in love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Against all opposition, they wed. Tired of the fighting, demons and humans alike were moved by their relationship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Thus, a pact was made. The demons swore that they would no longer devour humans, and the humans vowed never to kill another demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Aaaaarrghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Dad! Dad, no!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>So that she would never have to harm a human like her lover...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>..the demon broke both of her own horns. She fashioned one of them into a special stone, in which she sealed her godlike demon powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>The other horn was shaped into a blade, so that something would be able to subdue the stone if the demonic powers within the stone were ever misused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>And so, peace was brought to the land of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Grrraaaaggh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Gyaaaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Demons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>That is an old tale known to all in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>However, in the Wadatsumi of today...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>It's hopeless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>...demons run wild across the land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Urgaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Wha—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Sorry I'm late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>You're going to be okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Grrrraaaaarrrrggghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Don't worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>It's already over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Grraa— Gyyaaaaaaarggh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>It isn't safe here. You should evacuate, quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>A-are you... Could it be that you all are...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Damn demons! Get outta my sight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Celis, you got some nerve leavin' us behind and runnin' off on your own. You know you're our commander, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>I just did what was necessary to minimize casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>I can never understand you. We exist solely to eliminate demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Can you please leave some for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Oh, come on. There's plenty left for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>All right. They're mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Who...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Tch! Kagomurasaki hokum. Just let me handle this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>You hear me, Azami?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>I thought we agreed to work as a team. You could get court-martialed like this. Keep in mind that you have the rest of the Corps to think about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Tell that to our commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Besides, if they can't keep up, I don't want 'em in my corp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>I don't think you understand what I'm saying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>I'm asking you to leave some for me, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Hahahahaha! All right, then. Follow me then, Azami!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>They're cute together, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>They are very alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>You know, it wouldn't kill you to show some gusto every now and then too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Our house our rules. I'm not gonna be like that. Besides, I have to take care of our younglings today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Seal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Grr...! Gah...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>A-are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>We are the blades forged to cut down demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>Rest easy. No longer will your lives be disrupted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>It's the Blade Fox Corps!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Blade Fox Corps Third Squad Captain, Tanosuke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Blade Fox Corps Second Squad Captain, Ugachi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>And I'm both the First Squad Captain and Commander of the Blade Fox Corps, Celis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>Leave it to us, the Blade Fox Corps, the demon slayers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>The Blade Fox Corps! They've come to save us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Quickly, let's get you some place safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Tanosuke, I'll leave the trials to you, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>You worried about her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>Not at all. She's a strong one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>She's the apple of your eye, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>Nothing like that. It's all for the greater good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>Very well. Leave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>You need not words to subdue the demons. Our blades alone shall be our speech.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>What we protect is the good of the people. Their everyday lives. That is what our blades are for! Blade Fox Corps! Attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>I want to eradicate this infestation of demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>I don't know when it started, but I have always felt a strong urge to do so boiling up from within myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>From within...myself...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>...No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>I was passionate about it, but it wasn't my passion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>I don't know where that feeling was coming from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>But for now, none of that matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>Come on out, young foxes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>Let's begin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>This will be your final examination for the Blade Fox recruitment trials!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>If we do not exterminate the demons, they will devour the everyday lives of the people. I cannot allow that to happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240</td>
<td>I want to protect the normalcy of my life and of all lives in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>241</td>
<td>That is why I am here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>242</td>
<td>Where is this feeling coming from, and where will it take me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>243</td>
<td>I believed that I would find the answer in the end by protecting everything I set out to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>244</td>
<td>Seal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>245</td>
<td>All right, let's get going then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>246</td>
<td>I've set up a force field around a portion of this village. There are about...three demons within it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>247</td>
<td>Your trial is to defeat the three demons. Now, you don't have to be the one who delivers the finishing blow to pass. I'll be observing your skills comprehensively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>248</td>
<td>I, Tanosuke, Third Squad Captain of Blade Fox will be your proctor. Any questions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>249</td>
<td>Are there any civilians within the force field?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>250</td>
<td>We've evacuated the villagers to an area far from here. You can assume there aren't any.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>251</td>
<td>So we can just focus on the demons, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>252</td>
<td>Exactly. This is a trial. We wouldn't demand that you fight while protecting civilians. Not yet, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>253</td>
<td>I mean, it's not like you'll be able to do so. Well, if you could, that would make my job that much easier. The only thing you need to worry about protecting is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>254</td>
<td>"Never turn your back to a demon." Just this one rule alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>255</td>
<td>Turning your back to a demon is synonymous with abandoning someone's life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>256</td>
<td>Exactly. Just as I should have expected from Commander Celis's favorite student. Or should I say Vice-Captain Azami's best friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>257</td>
<td>My name is Amane! I vow to exterminate the demons and protect the people's everyday life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>258</td>
<td>I will bring peace to Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>259</td>
<td>Hahaha! Well, that's some ambition you've got there! So this is just the first step for our glorious messiah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>260</td>
<td>Don't let me down, Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>261</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>262</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>263</td>
<td>Um... Is there anything else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>264</td>
<td>Oh, no. It's nothing. Try not to get hurt, okay? All right, everybody, begin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>265</td>
<td>Over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>266</td>
<td>Grrraaaaaarrrrrgghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>267</td>
<td>Urk...! A-are we really going against that thing?! C-can we really do it on our own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>268</td>
<td>Don't let your morale break! This is what we've trained for! Remember, our blades were forged to protect the people of Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>269</td>
<td>If we lose our nerve, then those who could've been protected will fall victim!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>270</td>
<td>(Azami overcame trials much like this one and climbed her way up. I can't fall too far behind!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>271</td>
<td>L-look who's talking. You're trembling too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>272</td>
<td>F-fool! Th-this is just adrenaline! Here it comes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>273</td>
<td>This is how I do it. This is where it starts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>274</td>
<td>I'm going to bring peace to Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
