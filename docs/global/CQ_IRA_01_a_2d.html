<td>Argh! I just can't stand this! I can't stand this at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Dammit, Corvus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I don't get it! Why won't you give me a solo mission?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I've gotten stronger! You've been helping me train, so if there's anyone who should know that, it's you! And yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I have no doubt that you've followed the guidance of the darkness within me, becoming engulfed the same darkness as I in the process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>However, your darkness is still a far cry from being true darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You're always too hard to understand! Say it in a way that normal people like me can make sense of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm telling you that you still lack the power to handle a mission on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Impatience has no place here. Our training will continue and eventually the right time will come. Yes, that's what the darkness whispered to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm not strong enough yet? I can't stand this! I can't stand this at all! I just can't! I am not weak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Dammit! What can I do to make Corvus see that I'm strong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ah, there you are! Whacha doing in a place like this, Ira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Silma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Uh oh, look at this! You're always all scratched up after training with Corvus, so you've gotta remember to treat your injuries properly, Ila!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, lookee here! This bandage is pretty cute, huh? I'll put it on for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hey! You don't have to do that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What's with you? Isn't it super cute? Now sit still!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I said I don't need it! Why are you fussing over me, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Why? Hmm... We're friends, aren't we? We're both part of the Shadow Messiah and all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You and me? Friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You can't just declare yourself someone's friend! That's not how it works and I don't need friends anyway!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Only weaklings surround themselves with friends and use each other to get ahead. I have no need for that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What? Why? The Shadow Messiah are your friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The Shadow Messiah are comrades guided by the same darkness. That's what Corvus says.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hey, don't you start go repeating what he says when you don't understand it yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I didn't join the Shadow Messiah to play buddy-buddy with anyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I will get revenge on the ones that took everything away from me. For that, I need power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's why I came to the Shadow Messiah. I came to obtain power. I came to get stronger. And now, I am stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm telling you that you still lack the power to handle a mission on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Argh! Dammit, I just can't stand this! I can't stand this at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What can I do to get him to see my strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmm? I think Corvus does see that you're strong. If he didn't, I don't think he would bother to be so hard on you in training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But he won't give me any solo missions. He said that I wasn't powerful enough...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hmm... That would be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>In other words, there's a possibility that people who hold a grudge against us are planning an attack against us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes. Looks like they've even built a hideout in the Western Woods. Quite a number of people have gathered there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We can't allow them to get in the way of the will of the Shadow Messiah. I'll have to report this to Corvus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh my. That's not a comforting sign, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well, the Shadow Messiah should be able to capture them right away. Even if they attack us, we'll turn the tables on them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We can't afford to just let them come for us whenever they want! We've gotta prepare!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>W-wait! Ila! Where are you going? Oh no... Don't tell me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>This is perfect! I'll take all of them myself! Then Corvus will have to change what he thinks of me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hold on! There are tons of dangerous beasts in the Western Woods!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Like I said, I can handle this on my own!</td>
