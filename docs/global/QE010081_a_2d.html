<td>Hey, Logi...assuming you do catch up with Sabareta, what will you do then?</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>

<td>You don't plan to kill him, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...Why do you ask?</td>

<td>005</td>
<td>That man...I don't think he's a bad person. He went out of his way to prevent the death of innocent people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Burdened with the deep despair of Wratharis, he channels their anger in battle...but I don't think he's lost his pride as a knight.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>After having crossed blades with him...I've come to think the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>He wants to change this Alchemy-shaped world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>His methods are wrong...but I'm beginning to think our hopes are the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes! That's why I would like to realize our hopes together with him...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Our hope of peace between the two countries of Wratharis and Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If we can work together with them, I think we can change this world...no, I'm certain we can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yeah! To do that, let's meet him again! Let's come together and convey our hopes to him!</td>
