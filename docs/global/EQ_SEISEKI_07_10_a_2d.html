<td>An assassin hired by Waginau...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. I am connected to Lord Waginau and can wield the power of darkness. It appears we have similarities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Y-you scum! How could you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So...you were the wielder of the power of darkness after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes. I am sorry for hiding it from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Just so you know, I have no intention of joining them. Don't place us in the same boat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey, please wait! You can't go any further...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well, I'm not exactly sure why. I just don't want to let you through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What are you talking about? You've got business with Kanon as well, don't you? If that's so then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I told you, you can't go passed me. I still can't fully comprehend the meaning of her words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I can't afford to let you get in the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The meaning of Kanon's words?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes. She was going on about being bonded and about feelings...the same kind of nonsense that you two have been going on about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm starting to get interested...in this uncertain thing that she places so much value in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>In any case, I can't let you advance any further. I'm sorry I have to do this to you being that this is the first time we've met, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Captain Kudanstein...I'll stop you with all my power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You were hiding...this much dark power?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I don't understand what you're talking about, but now isn't the time for you to get involved. Stand back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>He disappeared...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'm behind you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ack?! ...You're fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's nothing yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Agh?! Wh-what...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Just so you know, I'm more accustomed than you are to using the art of darkness. After all, I've been trained since I was little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I'm ending it here! "Banishment"!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Aghh!!! Ackkk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No way! ...And against Kudan out of all people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You and I are very similar. But...it's odd...my interest lies elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Wh-what...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>More than Lord Waginau...I am interested in learning about what the Commander Kanon thinks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You're quite tenacious. Do you still have strength left in you? I won't go easy on you even in the end, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...I won't allow it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Tsk. I didn't ask for your help...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This man is seeking far greater heights than you are. This isn't the time and place for the likes of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...Huahhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ack! Who...are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Victor?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Little frog! Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Right back at you! Why are you...fighting against Kudanstein?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That has nothing to do with you. More importantly...you should be running away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>This person is obviously on a whole other level than you are. You'll just end up hopping around on the ground like a frog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hey, hold on...why are you worrying about me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...I've started to feel like I want to experience it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I want to experience this thing you guys call a bond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Don't make me have to put in an extra effort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>

<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Huff...huff...! You've finally become decent, you idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'm telling you that passionate feeling you have now is what lies in the center of being human! Come on, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...! Yes!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What beautiful and mesmerizing friends. That being said, don't allow his actions to sway you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...! Wait! Don't recklessly involve yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>While we're wasting time here, Kagura...this world...is being placed at risk...! I...won't...let...you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>No! Guard yourself against it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>My mission was to protect you...but you ended up saving me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Basheeny...hehe...it's fine. Try and rest a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Commander Kanon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Who would've thought you'd be the one to make your way to me. It's been a while, Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Be careful, Kanon! Captain Kudan's power of darkness is even stronger than before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I know...thank you, Seida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I came here to take Kagura from you. Where is she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
