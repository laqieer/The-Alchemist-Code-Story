<td>Young lady, I'm glad you're safe. Are you hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No. Edgar and Ronnie risked their lives to save me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Risked their lives, huh? That's some resolve you got there. Well done, Ronnie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>He-heheh. Nah, it was nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well, what's he up to then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh! Let him be for now. He's depressed that the redhead beat him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Depressed, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Gwahahahah!!! Well, that's hilarious!!! So you finally got thrown off your high horse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Shut up, loser.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You disappeared at the most crucial moment. Did you go running back to your momma?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm gonna kill you!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'd love to see you try! I just happened to be boiling over with anger right now, you massive-armed idiot!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Stop, please! We were finally able to come together. Why do you have to fight?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ack... Sorry. Just call it reflective instincts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Heh. You're a real wuss when it comes to women, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Edgar!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Tsk. Fine. Well, we managed to gain an advantage over that redhead...so I guess I can live with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>An advantage? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I've finally had an idea about where the Sacred Stone might be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>While we were fighting inside the train compartment...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This little guy asked me why I didn't accept the power at the Door of Truth. That's when I realized...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Which little guy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It was right in front of our noses the whole time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Alkemono, you're the one who has the Sacred Stone Belphegor!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Squeak...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Allie has it?! What do you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Think back. Ethan told you that this little guy would lead you to the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>When we asked where the Sacred Stone was located, he showed us a map with our current location marked on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>More importantly...he has emotions and the ability to speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's true that Allie started speaking after Ethan entrusted me with this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Alkemono, you have the Sacred Stone Belphegor inside you! Right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Squeak...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Don't squeak at me. Stop feigning ignorance with your squeaks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Squeak! Squeak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Something's wrong with it. Alkemono?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I remember Logi was tampering with Allie before you and the others arrived, Edgar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That scum!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Squeak...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's no good. The Sacred Stone doesn't seem to be responding. Hey, what are we supposed to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If we can't find him using the map, we've no choice but to search for him on foot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>How are we supposed to find him? He's disappeared without a trace. Right, Tango?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We've searched the surroundings, but there's no sign of him. It seems like he intended to disappear all along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hmph. Maybe you guys just aren't very good at looking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What did you say...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Stop lashing out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It's important to be calm when you hit a roadblock. Wasn't that what you were always telling me, idiot?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Tsk. Shut up. Ultimately, it looks like we have to start at the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The beginning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ethan is the only remaining clue to the Sacred Stone's location. I'm going to save him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Now that we know he wasn't on the train, the logical conclusion is that he's still captured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You're heading to the Beckrams' mansion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Yep. The chances are slim, but we might obtain a clue to finding that redhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>So we're finally gonna infiltrate their home base!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Jeez. Hey, Tango, prepare for battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yes, Don!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Are you sure? I thought you had no intention of getting involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I wanted to be sure of what he was made out of first. I know enough now. He doesn't have what it takes to lead this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Come on. Enough chatter. It's been a long time coming, but we're off to battle now!</td>
</tr>
