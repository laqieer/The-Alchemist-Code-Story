<td>First, regarding the location of the Jam's outbreak, it is spread out all across Saga. Furthermore, the rate of growth is exponentially fast.</td>

<td>Hypothesis...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Yes. First, it's that the source of the Jam outbreak is invisible to the eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>However, although invisible, there is most certainly something present there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Perhaps a likely explanation would be that the Jam's source is a microorganism that is invisible to the naked eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Thus, judging by the speed of growth and distribution...I have arrived at one answer.</td>

<tr>
