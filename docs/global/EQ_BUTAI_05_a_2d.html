<td>I should have expected nothing less from the Holy Guard. This shall be entertaining.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Tch! Not now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So, who will die first? In fact, I would not be opposed if you were to all try and attack me at once. It would make killing the lot of you that much easier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't worry about the soldiers. I will have them stand aside. I won't let them disturb our fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You dare belittle us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Sure of yourself, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Then you won't mind if we take advantage of your kind invitation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No matter what happens, we will not divulge the whereabouts of the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hahahahahaha! I have no interest in what you know about them! The Sacred Stones will come to me eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It is more important to me that I eliminate you, the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Now come, Paladins! Let me show you the meaning of strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmph. Disappointing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Got you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Weaklings!</td>

<td>026</td>
<td>You are better than I had expected. Unfortunately, you are still no match for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Not even the so-called Great Thunder Axe can hurt me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'm not done yet! If we leave you to your vices, more innocent blood will be spilled! Lives will be lost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>We will not allow you to trifle with the lives of others! My chivalrous code forbids it! For that is our absolute justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What a bold claim! The absolute justice of the continent? When you are so weak? Don't make me laugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Nnrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Justice must be strong! The weak cannot be righteous! Strength and justice go hand in hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That is not true! Your power cannot be justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's right. We won't let you be the one to define what justice is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hmph! Maybe try to strike me even once before you object to my words!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The weak can do nothing against the power of my justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That voice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ahem...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Watch flowers bloom in spring. Skip work during the day and work nights instead in the summer. Make a campfire from dried leaves in autumn, and sleep in on the cold days of winter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Appreciate the subtle differences in how wine can taste depending on the scenery before you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Kudanstein... What are you on about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>There used to be a man who would protect this country for reasons as simple as those.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>He loved this country, and died dreaming of the day in which it could be called safe again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Nonsense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You're right. Just some absurdity from a fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But our cause is one that protects even such absurd nonsense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Your sense of justice is fragile. I'll prove that to you, here and now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hah! Then show me, Kudanstein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I see that I was not mistaken in my assessment of your strength! Still, you are nothing before me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You're probably right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I would not be able to defeat you aloneâ€”but I am not alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Miracle Kanon Slash!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting, Captain Kudan!</td>

<td>058</td>
<td>4th Regiment trainee Basheeny, reporting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Our strength is different from that which you would call strength. It comes from our bond, which connects us because we choose to be connected and to support one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>This is the power of the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Hmph... Hahahahahaha! What power?! You call this bond powerful?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You flock together because you are weak! The weak will bend their knee to the strong! This has been proven time and time again throughout history!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Our justice would defend those who are forced to bend their knee. We will not lose to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Then prove it, Kudanstein!</td>
