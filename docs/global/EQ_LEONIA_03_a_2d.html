<td>Gentlemen! Calm yourselves. If Shayna caught sight of you like this, she would be most saddened!</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>And you are...?</td>

<td>I suppose you must be another Fan Club member. Well, so are we. Don't talk as if you're buddy-buddy with her; you're no better than any of us.</td>

<td>I am the Pure Whâ€”ahem. Nobody special. I am merely here to do whatever I can to both protect and support Lady Shayna.</td>

<td>Shayna! Please, tell me! What's going on between the two of you?!</td>

<td>Huh? Like, nothing? Guys, listen up! Leoniaz is serving me today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>S-s-serving?!</td>

<td>Oh, dear... I think we're giving them the wrong idea, my lady.</td>
</tr>

<td>Darn it! Curse you! Stay away from our Shayna!</td>
