<td>Huff...huff...huff...! Hyaaaaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You're inexperienced in Alchemy, but your brute strength is more than a man's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ack. Even in training, I've never been able to do Alchemy really well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Whining won't fix anything. If you can't master Alchemy, the only other alternative is death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ohh... That's harsh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Not your death...Chloe's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Do you want to save your friend? Then you must master Alchemy as if her life depends on it—because right now it does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Um, Captain Cadanova! Please...teach me Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Kanon, what do you think is the most important quality when it comes to Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>W-well, I think that would be...the amount of Alchemia Particles you're born with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's the state of your heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My heart...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Right now your mind is trapped in the desperate need to master Alchemy to quickly save your friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Then...what should I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Kanon, remember your honor and the path you believe in and must pursue. Why did you want to become a Paladin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>W-well, you might laugh, seeing how incompetent I am, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I want to become the captain of the Holy Guard and protect the peace in Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I joined the Holy Guard because I wanted to create a world where everyone could be happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Then stop being swayed by your emotions. Everything you do must be to fulfill your greater mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Understood, Captain! I'll...try my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>They should be arriving soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Za-Zahar, why are you doing this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>As a hostage, you'd do best to remain silent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You were next in line to be captain, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Why did you turn against the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You're still a Squire, correct? Here's my advice: Don't become a Paladin. You're better off that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'll show you with this battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What? Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>They're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You're Chloe, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Y-yes, Captain! Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Unbelievable! Has he extracted Alchemia Particles from your body?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I-I'm so sorry! I allowed the enemy to steal my power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No, I'm the one that should apologize for having put you through this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>N-not at all! I...I'm sorry for being a burden to you, Captain Vettel! Sniff...waaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's been a while, Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Heh. I've missed you, Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Zahar, your sin of having made one from Envylia weep is heavy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Heheh. Even when I think of you now, it makes my right eye ache.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>This time, you won't get away with just losing an eye. I'm going to stop you here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hmph. When you can't even use Alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Not can't—won't! I'll teach you that there's no peace in Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'll teach you something as well. The only thing that can change this world is invincible power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Captain Vettel, be careful!</td>
</tr>
