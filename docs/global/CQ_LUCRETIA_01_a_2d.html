<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Sigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(Not again.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Do you understand, Queen Lucretia? For the hundredth time, I must inform you that you are the queen of this country!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's true that you have accomplished countless military exploits as a knight. However...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's outrageous for you to advance past the vanguard on your own and leap into the midst of the enemy troops!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Please, exercise caution and be aware of your position as queen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Fine, fine. As you've said, I'll be more careful next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Now, excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(Seriously. I positioned myself at the vanguard because I am aware of my position as queen.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Did you receive a scolding again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Lord Gane...it's you, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Don't let it get to you. We are all aware of your triumphs on the battlefield, Queen Lucretia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You are the "flower of the battlefield." Your radiance increases the men's morale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's encouraging to hear that. So...what can I do for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ah, I am simply here to help put my warrior queen at ease and give her respite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Would you like some tea? I've obtained some good tea leaves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I appreciate the gesture, but I have business to attend to. Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I see. That's unfortunate. On another occasion, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Queen Lucretia! You are very welcome! Please, take your time to look around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Thank you. I'll do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(What a beautiful dress...with such glittering colors...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Oh! This embroidery! And these frills! How adorable...! It's so pretty!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ohh...such beauty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Is it to your liking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Mm...ahh...it's a stunning dress like always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Much appreciated. By the way, the dress that you purchased the other day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, I'm sorry. I still haven't worn it yet. Still, the soft violet color was very beautiful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Please, no need to excuse yourself. Thanks to your victories in battle, Queen Lucretia, we can live in peace every day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>However...one day, the war will be over. I pray from the bottom of my heart that I will be able to see you in a dress then, my queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Heh. I wonder if anything other than armor would suit me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Absolutely, it would! Make no mistake about it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Thank you. When the time comes, please make the ultimate dress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes. Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That's right. I'm in the middle of tailoring a few new dresses. I think you'd like them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I see! I'm looking forward to them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Well then...I guess I should return soon. Looking at the dresses make me lose track of time.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh? Queen Lucretia... Were you secretly out shopping?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hm? Oh, you again... What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No...I just happened to be passing by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(Passing by? I feel like he was waiting for me. What a curious person.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>A clothes shop...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>If you wish to wear dresses, then you should summon a tailor to the castle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>After all, you are the queen. That much should be expected...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Sigh... It's true that I come from royalty, but I am also a knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>During this time of war, I have no time to be dressing up when I must be protecting my people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Besides, I cannot summon a tailor to the castle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The other day, you called me the "flower of the battlefield," didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes, indeed, I did. I was not flattering you. Those were my honest words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Queen Lucretia, when you participate in battle, the morale of the soldiers is completely different. You inspire us all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I don't necessarily consider myself to be a flower, but I do wish to protect my country and my soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If I were to call a tailor to the castle, all my varlets would be overjoyed. They would make me wear one dress after anotherâ€”none of which would catch my interest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Eventually, they would stop me from showing myself in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>If that were to happen, it would be the end of your so-called "flower of the battlefield."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Would you be all right with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Queen Lucretia! There you are! I'm here to make a report!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The enemy troops are approaching in droves! Their first wave is already looming up ahead! Please! We await your presence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You did well to inform me! My horse! I'll join you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'll go as well!</td>
</tr>
