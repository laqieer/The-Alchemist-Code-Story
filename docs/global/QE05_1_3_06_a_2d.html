<td>There are a lot more beasts than I had expected. No wonder a bodyguard is necessary for you to get to the altar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Malta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Do you remember, Kamui? We were attacked by beasts like this when we were just kids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I remember selfishly demanding that we go to the orchard at the base of the tree to gather fruit at night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ah, I remember that now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I managed to fend off the beasts, but I was too exhausted to move afterward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hehe, Protector Judah came and found us just in the nick of time. He gave us such an earful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>He sure did. Why tell this story now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You protected me with your life. That was probably the first time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The first...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I wonder how many times I've come to this altar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My entire adolescence was spent praying here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Malta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You were here too, remember? When Protector Judah was alive, you spent your time here, learning about Spiritbonding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So, you could say we grew up together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What's going on, Malta? Is now really the time to be reminiscing about the past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. This is the only time we have left to do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>After that, you gradually began leaving the village for your duties more and more often.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You brought me so many gifts from outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I really loved the way you smiled when talking about the outside world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>To tell you the truth, I was always envious of you. It seemed like you had a choice about how to live your future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes... Thinking back on it, I realize you never had that same freedom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I was born with a natural affinity for becoming the druidic priestess, and my obligations as the Chief's daughter sealed my fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>M-Malta?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Th-this is the same darkness that had enveloped Hisham! A corrupting energy!</td>
