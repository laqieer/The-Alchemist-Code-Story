<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hmm... What shall we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>N-No... Now, the magic...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Will fail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Gaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No! The ritual cannot be completed now. We should get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey, Sol? The magic those guys were using...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes, it did look familiar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's a Wadatsumi ritual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It looked like they were performing it wrong, so it wouldn't work. Still, all those rituals were lost when the priestess was killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But perhaps... Maybe when Wadatsumi was invaded, something was taken from the priestess's house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>During the fighting, there was no one to enforce the law and prevent looting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The magic they were using earlier is a kind of illusion used to manipulate people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But that ritual should only be able to affect the living. It's not meant to be used on the dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Perhaps, he mistakenly got it into his head he could control an immaculate immortal soldier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>An immortal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>They were an experiment used during The Lion Monarch's Charge at Greed Dike...and mobilized to invade Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I never thought I'd see the likes of them again, let alone here. And so well preserved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Indeed. But exhuming them doesn't sit right with me. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...Though I suppose I've no place to say such things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I've no interest in what they meant to do, but it is a grim thing for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The magic they intended to use was certainly not meant for whatever they were up to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We should try and put a stop to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Even if it won't affect immortal soldiers, who knows what trouble they might cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes, but isn't it a problem if we're the only ones who care about that child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I don't think so. And I'm coming with you. It's the least I can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(Even after I'm gone, there are those who will think of you and treat you as precious.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(...I'm so glad.)</td>
