<td>Zeldris, what are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I am here to obtain a new source of power. Power beyond your understanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You all have been a constant nuisance to me. Is it not natural to desire a power that will rid you of your troubles?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We will never lose to you, just as Meliodas never will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hmph. Your misplaced faith is pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>There's nothing pathetic about having someone to believe in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Those are words of someone who has never been betrayed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Even if I am to be betrayed at some point, my faith in Meliodas will always be resolute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hahahahaha! Faith! What a ludicrous notion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>To unconditionally believe in others and abandon all responsibility for your actions by refusing to think for yourself... You wouldn't call that pathetic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's not how it is! Don't you have somebody or something to believe in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I have a mission to accomplish. I have duties! I will not let such pitiful emotions sway my mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>There is nothing pitiful about how I feel towards Meliodas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Really? Ha. I'll enjoy seeing whether that conviction of yours lasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It will not change even if I were to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're beginning to become such an eyesore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're the one wreaking havoc in my world! You're the eyesore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So you denounce the concept of faith and trust. Some would reach for a source of light to trust in, even after being cast into the abyss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yet you refuse even that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You must be the natives of this world. Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I will warn you just this once. Do not turn your back on me, or else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You will soon be like them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Nng!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wait! Those are the people of Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Will you harm these innocent people who are under the control of my Piety?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You will learn what it means to get in my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...!</td>
