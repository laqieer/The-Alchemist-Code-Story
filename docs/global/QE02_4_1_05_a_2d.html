<td>Don! That was a close call! You saved us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Agh. I can't believe you saved me. Am I going senile?</td>

<td>Yep. We should just assume that they now know all of our movement patterns and habits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Do you mean they can predict our actions?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yep. Although I have no idea how they're sharing that information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Anyway...the longer we take, the more they'll comprehend our movements, making it harder for us to advance forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There's no time to waste. We've no other choice but to step up our game and push forward!</td>
