<td>Shortly before the attack on Roxanne's manor...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Whew... I thought I'd never get rid of that lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I guess fame's a massive double-edged sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well, it is hard not to notice a dashing young man like yourself coming into the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Uh, good day, sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh, don't look so surprised. I heard everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>A Holy Guard, no less! Hmhm...hardly a common sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hah, well, I could do without some of that attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Returning from a mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Just en route to a friend's place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Speaking of which, I'm late enough as it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A beau of yours? You did say she would throttle you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It'll go double because we have guests, so yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(I wonder when was the last time I saw Soren...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, you must be in a hurry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...But I'm afraid you're not invited to the main event, so you'll just have to entertain me instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh? Not bad, Prince Charming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You knew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hard not to be a little wary when a woman of the cloth takes an unhealthy amount of interest in a man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sticks out like a sore thumb, in fact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Smart AND sassy. I'm going to enjoy this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmhm... Very well. As a reward, you may call me Nesha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...If only to beg for your sweet release later on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(S-She's strong!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(This chain—it's almost too fast to be real!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Eyes up here, darling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Where'd she—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Shion!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Heh... I'm getting a case of déjà vu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Just like back in Sakris Village, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>How unexpectedly romantic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ah well. I don't mind having a third join in...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The more the merrier! Ahahaha!</td>
