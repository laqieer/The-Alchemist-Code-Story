</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's coming into view. That's the port of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes. There's no doubt about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Your voice is quivering, Kagura. Are you nervous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No. It's just that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Are you feeling nostalgic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Home is home, even if it's transformed into something as desolate as this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Kagura...we must complete this mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>After all, the only thing that can destroy that thing is my sword and your skillset.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm aware of that. The power of the Mikaboshi must not be unleashed into the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Now that it has been uncovered, as a Paladin of the Holy Guard, we cannot do anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Besides, it is also the destiny of my family, so it is worth risking my life for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>At the moment, it is still unclear regarding the number of conflicting forces who will be after the Mikoboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>However, in order to avoid a single casualty, we must thoroughly prepare before implementing our strategy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Just as expected, Yauras should be now leading the knights of each regiment in pursuit of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What about the 4th Regiment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>They haven't been notified. I'm keeping it a secret from them. If Kudan were to come, it may become problematic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>For him, Wadatsumi is a place that changed who he was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Having experienced his own weakness there, it changed his core ambition to passionately seeking power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If Kudan were to learn about the dormant Mikaboshi, one can only imagine what this will lead to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If he were to forget his own morals in his pursuit of power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>In order to avoid the worst case scenario, we must keep him out of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I don't want to think of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes. But...I understand. We cannot allow Kudan to get any closer to the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>After everything is over, we can explain to him what had happened. The best we can wish for is that he will understand if not agree with this decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>In order to make this work, we must complete this mission swiftly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You've grown, Kagura. As Lord Commander, I am proud of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It appears that our welcoming party has come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Let's go, Kagura! Let's go save this world! ...Rising Sun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Kanon and the other have managed to protect the Sacred Stone that has long belonged to Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>However, the clothes of those seeking power have begun to tighten.</td>

<td>A Few Days Earlier...<br>Holy Guard - Council Room</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>There have been reports of skirmishes between a few tribes in rural areas of Saga. However, they appear unlikely to develop into bigger problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>In Gluttony's desert lands, there has recently been a pattern of large-scale bandit groups showing up and going on a rampage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The Guild led by Ryle and the Sand Hawks led by an individual called Balt have been working together to stop the bandits, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Whether or not they have been cooperating with each other is under suspicion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Around Wratharis, there is increasing discontent of farmers against the large landowners. It appears they are considering an uprising.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hmm... Well then, of the Paladins we've dispatched to the Saga region, send two battalions toward Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Use the Paladins currently stationed in Gluttony to act as a cushion between the Guild and the vigilantes, so that everyone can focus on the bandits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The situation around Wratharis is a little complicated. If we dispatch Paladins without fully explaining the situation, the citizens could rise up in revolt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>We'll dispatch several Paladins. They will work with the land owners and the farmers to reach a middle ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>If we can solve problems through communication, then that's always the best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I agree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Kudan...you're back. I thought I tasked you with dealing with the extreme rebels that have appeared in Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Yes. I've dealt with them just as you ordered. I've come here to report on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hmm. So you managed to quell a rebellion like that within a few days, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Never mind that. Give me my next assignment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Wielding my spear against amateurs who are extremists only in name leaves me wanting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Please give me a more solid missionâ€”one that I can bite into.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Heheh. Always the same, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Unfortunately, there are no missions that I can currently send you on. Take this opportunity, to rest your body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Tsk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huff...huff... Sir, I have a minor report to make. Please lend me your ear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Is that really the truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>There are many prying ears around here. Tell me the details later...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Everyone! My apologies, but we need to suspend this council temporarily. Please take the time to rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Our conversation should be safe here. Now tell me in more de...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hey, who are you people?!</td>
