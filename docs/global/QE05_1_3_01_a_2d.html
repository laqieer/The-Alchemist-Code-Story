<td>"Aurora formed in glory, fell my foes with flames of mercilessness!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's not good enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Alchemy and Spiritbonding share the same foundation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Essentially, that is to enhance your own Alchemia and conduct transmutation through a catalyst.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Alchemy tends to rely on Philosopher's Stones, a sort of concentrated Alchemia crystal, to be this catalyst.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>However, with Spiritbonding, the sephirah upon your body acts as the catalyst.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No matter how naturally talented one may be, each body is limited to only ten sephirah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If opponents bear the same number of sephirah, it is the difference in experience and skill that decides the outcome of a battle. Like so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Agh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What's the matter? Out of breath already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ngh! "Wisdom clears the path to clemency—"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Smart move, but too slow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You are quite adept with the use of Spiritbonding, but that alone will not make you a sound Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Casting is only necessary when supplementing what you lack when Spiritbonding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Most Sephira only have one sephirah upon their bodies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Casting allows them to beseech Sephiron for the absent sephirah needed to successfully use their desired spell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We Protectors, on the other hand, are connected to all ten sephirah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Guh! Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You must open the door that bars you from the great Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You have the power to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(The door? What does he...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Is that the door? That's right, I've seen it before. If I could just open it...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huaaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Haha! That's it! Remember that sensation, for that is what it means to be one with truth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>H-haa... Haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hm, that is enough for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Th-thank you for your guidance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It has been a while since I have had a student so promising. I'm sorry if I pushed you too hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I will be more careful next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(I never expected that being the Protector would require such mental fortitude and power.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It seems Lord Waginau has accepted you as his pupil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Chief! Even so, I am nowhere near his caliber.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Haste makes waste, young one. Take comfort in knowing you are indeed making progress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes, I know you are right. It is just that the prophecy Malta received lingers in my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It would be wise to just focus on your training as Protector for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Let me deal with the worldly obligations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We can always ask Lord Waginau for assistance if it becomes necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Kamui, why not take it easy a bit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Sorry, Hisham. Have I disturbed your studies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Not really, I just mean... You've been pacing ever since you got back home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(I cannot stop thinking about the abnormal movements of the Sacred Stone and Gluttony's armies. What is this uneasiness in my heart?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Kamui, are you home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Malta? Are you well enough to be out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Um, I was just wondering, can borrow you for a second?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I mean, with your training and everything, we hadn't had much time to talk lately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>So I was wondering if you and Hisham would like to join me for a picnic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh, go on Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hisham?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I don't know what you're so worried about, but this could be good for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Go take in some outside air and refresh your mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes, you might have a point...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hisham? Are you not coming?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'm busy reading. Besides, I don't want to get stampeded by a thirsty horse or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Wh-what?! I'm not—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hisham, did you not know that we have no horses in this village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but I've already decided to immerse myself in a book today! You two go have fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Gladly.</td>
