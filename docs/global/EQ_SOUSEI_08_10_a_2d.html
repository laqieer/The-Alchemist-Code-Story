<td>The will of the Cursed Beasts surpasses even the limitations of time. Back when I was controlling Satna, that proved to be quite the ordeal to overcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>But you have to overcome it, because in order to get the Cursed Beast's power, you have to speak directly with it, on its own...plane, I guess you'd say. I'm sure she's doing fine, though.</td>

<td>Oh, all I did was mumble something about how, if it joined me, I'd bring the world back to the state it was in before it got sullied by all the corruption. That did the trick.</td>

<td>What's important is figuring out how much they know, and what they've come here to do.</td>

<td>You say that like it's some big mystery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>They're obviously here to crush the Infinite Serpent so they can save the world!</td>

<tr>

<td>Huh, and here I thought you'd finally decided to get on board with our plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Well, I... I mean, stalling for time is the best option available to achieve your ends. I'm sure these actions will at least spare the current generation, and protect the world of today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>But tomorrow must still come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Yeah, you're right. But the people of tomorrow will handle it. They'll make their own destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>It's the future, after all! Things'll be a bit better than they are now, if nothing else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Such flippancy! Regardless, what should we do in the present? Attack them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Yeah, of course! Emmel still hasn't gained control over Lucifer's core. We've gotta make sure she has the time and space she needs to finish the job.</td>

<td>Gaining power through Cursed Beast cores... They're both such sinful children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>And that's exactly why they have the right to carry the weight of this world's fate on their shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Helene, I'm going to leave Emmel in your care. Women have to watch out for each other, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
