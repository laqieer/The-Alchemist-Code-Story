<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Please accept me, Lucifer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I know. The dragons' dearest wish was to recreate the world, and you don't want to relinquish the hopes and prayers they entrusted to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But my choice here is not to deny your wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We simply want a little more time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If you are truly settled on relinquishing the world to us anyway, couldn't you spare us at least that small leniency?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Access to Superbia Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Life extension request from human species accepted. As a beast that devours sin, I shall heed this entreaty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Seems like the synchronization is going pretty well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Synchronization?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The will of the Cursed Beasts surpasses even the limitations of time. Back when I was controlling Satna, that proved to be quite the ordeal to overcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But you have to overcome it, because in order to get the Cursed Beast's power, you have to speak directly with it, on its own...plane, I guess you'd say. I'm sure she's doing fine, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So you've had to speak with a Cursed Beast as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yeah, but mine was a total brat! All it did was talk about how it was going to eradicate humankind and stuff. Frustrates me all over again just thinking about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yet you were able to tame it, in the end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh, all I did was mumble something about how, if it joined me, I'd bring the world back to the state it was in before it got sullied by all the corruption. That did the trick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You...lied to a Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Sounds like it to me. A total scam, all the way around. A world changed by your magic alone wouldn't look much different in the eyes of a being like Satna...or anyone else's, for that matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hey, lay off. Not my fault the Cursed Beasts are gullible asâ€” Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Check it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Looks like they've finally arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Took them long enough! Though it's possible they just got flung to some out-of-the-way time period when they were caught up in my Space-Time Manipulation, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well... Does it matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What's important is figuring out how much they know, and what they've come here to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You say that like it's some big mystery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>They're obviously here to crush the Infinite Serpent so they can save the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Then they waste their time. This world can no longer be saved by anything but the Ceremony of Creation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ignacio!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What Emmel is doing right now is simply buying time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Once the lands fall to sin, the Ceremony must be carried out if humans are to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh, and here I thought you'd finally decided to get on board with our plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well, I... I mean, stalling for time is the best option available to achieve your ends. I'm sure these actions will at least spare the current generation, and protect the world of today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But tomorrow must still come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yeah, you're right. But the people of tomorrow will handle it. They'll make their own destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's the future, after all! Things'll be a bit better than they are now, if nothing else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Such flippancy! Regardless, what should we do in the present? Attack them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yeah, of course! Emmel still hasn't gained control over Lucifer's core. We've gotta make sure she has the time and space she needs to finish the job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's too soon for Nimul to see her. We'll have to keep them busy for a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Gaining power through Cursed Beast cores... They're both such sinful children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And that's exactly why they have the right to carry the weight of this world's fate on their shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Helene, I'm going to leave Emmel in your care. Women have to watch out for each other, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I've been watching out for her either way. I don't exactly need to be prompted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Good. I'm counting on you to keep it up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Now, let's get this thing over with. It's time for the next chapter in our prideful yet gloriously useless struggle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Welcome, travelers from without.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>We're glad to have you here. Please enjoy yourself to the fullest, before this world ceases to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Is this really the Infinite Serpent's stronghold?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It's weird how welcoming and hospitable everyone is. Kinda creepy, even!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Perhaps Emmel really did take over these lands, and it's made everyone friendlier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Maybe she'll even come out to greet us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...Are you being serious right now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hey, if she really is here, then the sky's the limit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I mean, why would Emmel be in Superbia Belt in the first place? How could she have taken down a Cursed Beast on her own? We're already in very unlikely territory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>For a matter this grand, I'd expect her to have at least talked things over with us and asked for our help. If what we've heard is true, this all seems very out of character for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hmm... Maybe she didn't think she could count on you this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Mira, don't be mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Sorry. I was just trying to lighten the mood with a little joke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>There's no need for us to just accept Shahel's words as fact. In fact, it's probably better to doubt them, at least a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>My point exactly! So much of what he said just doesn't add up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>We needn't jump to conclusions. We can decide what to believe after we've seen the truth with our own eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yeah. You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What a leisurely bunch you are. I'm surprised you were able to make it here at all with that laissez-faire attitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Oh, I know that voice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Quence?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hey. Been a while. Since Ire Belt, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I sure owe you a lot for what you did to my homeland. I haven't properly thanked you for it yet, have I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Oh, great. Just what I need right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Did you come all the way here just to track down little old me? I'm honored!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Nobody is here for you, and you know it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Don't get me wrong, if it means I can finally sever our ties, then I welcome this unexpected reunion...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>But we're fighting for the future. That's our purpose now. We're not here to return to the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Is that...sarcasm? Are you trying to be ironic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Not a bit. I'm just being honest with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Well... Then I'll return that favor, and say that I'm truly glad you didn't remain behind in Ire Belt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Because if I'd seen your face then, I would've killed you on the spot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Hahaha! What a coincidence! I would've done the same to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>What in blazes is that? A special trait of the people of Wrath?! If I can't get through with my magic, that's going to be a real problem here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Everyone, get behind Mesarthim!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Shield Maiden, huh? I've suffered my fair share by your like as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>If not for that shield, I dare say Invidia Belt would long have been sunk into the depths of the sea by Leviathan's power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You know, even I can get mad when the situation calls for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Oh, do lighten up! That was nothing more than a friendly greeting. Nothing personal, I assure you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Unfortunately for you all, the road's closed. If you really want to get through, you'll have to come back another day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Where's Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Come, now. Don't insult everyone's intelligence by asking something so obvious. You know why I'm standing here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Then we'll just have to force our way through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Wait, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>We've got this! The easiest way to deal with Space-Time Manipulators is to pit them against other Space-Time Manipulators...probably!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>You two...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Do you really think you'll be able to take me? I was always a step or two ahead of you back in Ire Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Excuse you? That's ancient history now. Leave the dead buried, man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>We have some unfinished business with you anyway, so we'll just take you back with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Ambrosia's waiting for you in Luxuria Belt. I'm sure she's got quite the welcome party prepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>And we'll drag you back with us kicking and screaming if we have to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Oh, you've gotta be kidding me there! I'll fight to the death if I must, but you're sure not getting me anywhere near her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Anyway, no need to worry about this guy. Like I said, we've got this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>The rest of you go on ahead to find Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Andechs. Daphne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Yeah? What's up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Take care of the enemies here, and support Mira and Nyx.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>You can count on us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I'm happy to stay behind. I'd like to give this blowhard a little taste of the suffering he brought upon the people of my home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Just don't do anything too crazy until we have a chance to catch up with you, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I won't. My sister's safety is on the line, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Let's just try to regroup as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Good luck to you all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>See, this is why I hate dealing with large groups...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>When they split up, it's pure chaos trying to deal with them all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Come on, Mira. Let's introduce this guy to the ground, then bring Ambrosia back a nice little souvenir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Ooh, that's a great idea! I bet she'll be over the moon! Not that we'd really be able to tell...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Yeah, she'll probably just have some harsh words to say, and keep that stone face of hers up the whole time she's saying them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Right. I wish she'd be a bit more honest about her feelings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>The heck are you two talking about?! She's blunt as a brick! I've never met another witch as honest as she is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Time sure is a cruel mistress, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>You can say that again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Come on. Let's make him face reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Right behind you, Nyx!</td>
</tr>
