<td>There's the beach!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wait, what's with this?! It's covered in garbage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I brought things to play on the beach with, but we won't be able to with all this. Jeez.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We didn't come here to play, you know... Still, is our mission this time to pick up trash?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No... We're supposed to be on guard duty and deal with the recent rash of attacks by humanoid machines on the beach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Humanoid machines...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why would anyone throw their trash away in a public space?! Unforgivable... Unbelievable... Unacceptable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But who left this trash here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Regular trash, oversized trash, mechanical trash... I can't imagine it's all just trash from beachgoers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I understand your anger, but I think we should get a handle on the current situation first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>B-but how are we supposed to do that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Haa... Not good, not good. Gotta hold it in. Calm, calm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's just like Albea said. I have to keep calm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's understandable that you're angry. I'm angry, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's unthinkable to throw machines away like this. That's why we have to look into this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wait, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ahaha! Over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Aw, no fair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You...really want to do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We came all the way here to get to this beach, after all! I wanted to quickly finish our work and have fun with everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There there. Let's just clean up the beach until the humanoid machines show up for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We can't just leave it in this pitiful situation, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Awww...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well, it can't be helped! In order for all of us to have the most fun, we've got to knock these problems out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Still, it's pretty rare for Noah, Emma, and Pamela not to work together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I-is that not allowed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No, that's not what I'm saying at all. I just thought that it might be easier for you to interact with people that you're familiar with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That is...probably true. I'm always with those two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>They help calm me down when I get angry and give me a silver spoon when I'm about to blow my top...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(A silver spoon?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>They always take care of me. But I decided things can't stay this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I want to change myself. That's why I decided to try working separately from them this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Struggling against yourself in order to ease the burden on your friends... How wonderful, Noah! I may not be able to do much, but allow me to help you where I can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Suzuka...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Well, with that decided, let's get to cleaning this beach...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Isn't there too much trash here? Why? Why is there so much of it? Isn't it crazy that people would dump trash at a beach in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Noah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...It's all right. I got it under control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Getting mad at this solves nothing. In order to solve this problem, we've got to stop the source of this garbage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You're right. Albea did say that we should get a handle on the current situation first and all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Albea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's understandable that you're angry. I'm angry, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's unthinkable to throw machines away like this. That's why we have to look into this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Albea is amazing. She said she was angry, but she didn't look like she was at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I have to do better, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>This would totally still work if it just got fixed up a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>They probably thought there's no need to fix it. I guess not everyone wants to repair things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(This... Is this what running my repair shop, Magbea, can bring?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(I can't put a smile on my face and say that my brother is proud of me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(This is why I still haven't figured out the mechanism in the comb my brother gave me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>That's a cute comb. Is it yours, Albea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Um, yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Sorry, I got lost in the clouds for a moment. Let's get to cleaning this beach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You're really worried about those humanoid machines, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You get straight to heart of things, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm not that worried about them. I understand that machines can hurt people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>However, actually seeing the consequences of it... It upsets me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I don't build and maintain machines so they'll be used like this. At least, that's how I feel about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>That's why I don't feel good about machines being used like this even if I didn't build them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Albea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Ahhh! A robot took the seashells I found!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It took my water donut!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What in the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Why are Alkaroids...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Aren't those AJ2000s and AJ2500s?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Grrahck! Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>They're coming, Albea!</td>
</tr>
