<td>Th-this is highly inappropriate, Mayor Edward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Shut up! What is this place?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I can't believe you the mayor are trespassing on my property. What if the citizens were to find out about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Alvarez! Let's forgo the roundabout questions. Return the Sacred Stone to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but I cannot do that. As you can see, I still haven't finished with my development.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Belphegor! What is going on here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I am developing artificial intelligence using the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Once completed, their work efficiency will rise dramatically, thus reducing accidents and other human sufferings. It will lead to further development within our country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Artificial intelligence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's completely different than the story you told Ethan. Ultimately, you're just doing this for your own gain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What are you talking about? You are also quite versed in the development of Alkaroids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If we were to inject them with Alchemic energy, they would be able to deal with bandits who can wield Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Giving Alchemic energy to Alkaroids?! What nonsense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Why don't you understand? If we left everything in the hands of machines, we wouldn't have to sacrifice human life anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We should use the Sacred Stone and pursue this path!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's a mistake! Machines are ultimately tools. Humans must be the ones to wield them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If we rely on machines, one day they will take our place. We must not sacrifice our intelligence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Do you realize that your orthodox way of thinking has resulted in extensive casualties?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Are you going to continue to create victims like my father Jonathan?</td>
</tr>

<td>Jonathan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>He was made to develop weapons under your instructions. Ultimately, he was targeted for his abilities and killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Alvarez...are you Jonathan's...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The mindset of the user can change even the most excellent products or useful machines into deadly weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Those who are repulsive should be eliminated as much as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I see. I'm sorry. I take full responsibility for Jonathan's death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>But...I cannot allow Belphegor to remain absent any longer. At this rate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Will the colossal island that carries destruction be resurrected?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You...?! In any case, return it immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I thought I just told you that I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If I were you, I would leave now. After all, you wouldn't want the Alkaroids to recognize you as a pirate who is a threat to their artificial intelligence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...!</td>
