<td>Golem slayer, wild beast wrangler... That's going to be a long list of titles to add to my card.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I think we've lost sight of the trail. They've chased us to some unknown part of the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>And since we don't have a map of this place, it's going to take us a while to find our way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Indeed. Given the overgrown conditions of this section, this will soon become quite the task.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>HEY! You there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Halt! This is private property!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>State your identities and business at once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wait, what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Excuse me, sirs. We are accompanying our professor in the study of ecology, and the tavern owner informed us that the trail is open to the public.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>However, we lost our way and stumbled into the deeper parts of the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Please do forgive us. We don't have a map, you see. Would you kindly show us the way out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmph. My men reported hearing a disturbingly loud ruckus, and a trail of blood and slain monsters led us to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I could have you arrested for trespassing and illegal hunting in Milord's private grounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hunting? We were almost torn to shreds by those savage beasts, and we did nothing to provoke them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Maybe you should get your lord to look into these monsters. Won't do to have them escape and terrorize the locals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I will report this matter duly. As for the lot of you, we will be escorting you out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Stay out of these parts if you know what's good for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And one last thing... no funny business. My men are armed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Certainly not, good sir. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(This amount should do it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hey, pick up the pace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Certainly. My apologies. I was simply making sure nothing gets left behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Now that would just be TERRIBLE for your lord's hunting grounds, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Tch...</td>
