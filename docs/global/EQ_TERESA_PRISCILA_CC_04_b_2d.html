</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>I presume you're here now because you've deduced those researchers hid some of their data in this mine, and you've come to destroy it so it can never bring harm to the people. Is that correct?</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>And neither should you, Kalmia! Since you, too, value the safety and security of the people above all else.</td>

<td>I... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>You, who've sworn to keep your fury in check, would never again be able to truly put stock in your own convictions. Would that really be worth it, in the end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Wh-when you put it like that, it's rather hard to argue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Hate only spawns more hate. The target of our enmity must be conflict itself. We cannot let our anger take hold of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I've been preaching that for so long, and yet...I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>I understand how you feel. The same contradiction tears me apart inside as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>But the Ruinmaker is genuinely trying to extinguish an ember that threatens to spark an unimaginable inferno if left unchecked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>A noble goal like that should be met with nothing but support from us. You understand that better than anyone, Kalmia, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Haaah... And that's why you came to stop me from making a terrible mistake. Of course I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>From the day your father took me in, I've tried so hard to be a good sister, always watching out for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Yet here, you've turned the tables on me, showing stronger convictions than my own. When did you get to be so mature?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>Are you certain it's wise to lower your spear? I thought you hated me wholeheartedly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>I do. I can't pretend like I don't. Hatred is not such an easy emotion to let go of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>But conflict—particularly that which robs us of our loved ones and our future—is perhaps the one thing I hate more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>Conflict itself? Not those who propagate it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Indeed. So for the sake of the innocent lives we both fight to protect, and so as not to not spawn any new conflict, I will only strike down those I face on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>That has been my policy for some time. I simply lost sight of it for a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>For now, it means I will not strike you down. Next time we meet, however...you may not be so lucky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>Next time we meet, huh?</td>
