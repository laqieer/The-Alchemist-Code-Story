<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Big mistake, coming here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>For you, perhaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Thousands of soldiers will come to hunt you down. This is going to be nothing like before. You have nowhere to run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hmph. Is that supposed to frighten me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's pointless to struggle, you know. No one will be coming to your rescue. It's really quite sad to see how far you've fallen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You don't seem particularly fazed by this. I take it you've become accustomed to such dealings since leaving the knights?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This doesn't concern you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'd say that's a yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Did you come to fight me? I'd appreciate it if we could settle this later. I'm afraid now is not exactly a good time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I don't really care if it's convenient. There's no guarantee I'll ever see you again if I let you go now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I have to take my chances when they come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>How unfortunate. But, I suppose I'll do what I must in order to continue my mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>And what mission might that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>To bring an end to war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hmph. That farce again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's no farce. It's my calling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>There are simply things I need to destroy in order to achieve it. If I don't, those things will cause much greater chaos moving forward, and helpless people will be unreasonably exploited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I can't remember...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>When was the last time we all laughed together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Memories of my family...are so fuzzy these days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I can't allow this to go on. Never again will I let people suffer before my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The one and only thing I can do is fight on, for their sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You fight for your people, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Even with a target on your head, you choose to fight on alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I haven't the luxury of time to do much else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Even though your mission will die along with you, should you fall?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Do you hate me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wholeheartedly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I appreciate your honesty. Still, for Lamia's sake, I cannot let myself be struck down by you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I will snuff out the seeds of conflict. I will not allow new hate to be born. Whatever it takes, I'll do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You're barely even making sense anymore. What are you even on about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Do you like flowers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What?! Are you incapable of holding a coherent conversation?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I told you, I haven't much time. Even if I can't end all wars, the things I do are not arbitrary; I believe I can greatly deplete the seeds of conflict that would otherwise grow into all-out war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Fine. I'm listening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Though she always lamented the fact that her talents can only be put to good use in battle—the thing she hates most—she still chose to fight alongside me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yet to sever the cycle of hatred, I must inevitably burden her with a final task that I know won't be easy for her. So please, I beg of you, stay out of my way. Let me finish what I've started, properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Rrg. You aren't convincing me of anything here! I don't even understand what you're saying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Don’t cry for me, Kalmia. I anticipated an end like this the moment I chose to fight. It’s no one’s fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I just couldn't stand by and do nothing while our people suffered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I believe in you, Kalmia. You must end this cycle of hate. You have it in you...to end this war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What I do understand, however, is that you're parroting the same ends he spoke of...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yet when they pass your lips, you defile his memory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Kalmia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Priscilla?! What are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I came to stop you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ruinmaker. I hear you've been going around seeking out and destroying any material related to the clandestine Alchemical experiments performed in Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>How did you come by this information?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I've had our intelligence operatives investigate your recent activities since your departure from the knighthood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I presume you're here now because you've deduced those researchers hid some of their data in this mine, and you've come to destroy it so it can never bring harm to the people. Is that correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hmph. And if I have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If you have...then as a knight who fights for the safety of the common folk, I see no reason to turn my spear upon you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>And neither should you, Kalmia! Since you, too, value the safety and security of the people above all else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Killing her here, so far from the field of battle, would be a rather shameful act for a knight in the first place. It would be tantamount to murder, justified by little more than vengeance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You, who've sworn to keep your fury in check, would never again be able to truly put stock in your own convictions. Would that really be worth it, in the end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Wh-when you put it like that, it's rather hard to argue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hate only spawns more hate. The target of our enmity must be conflict itself. We cannot let our anger take hold of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I've been preaching that for so long, and yet...I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I understand how you feel. The same contradiction tears me apart inside as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But the Ruinmaker is genuinely trying to extinguish an ember that threatens to spark an unimaginable inferno if left unchecked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>A noble goal like that should be met with nothing but support from us. You understand that better than anyone, Kalmia, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Haaah... And that's why you came to stop me from making a terrible mistake. Of course I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>From the day your father took me in, I've tried so hard to be a good sister, always watching out for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yet here, you've turned the tables on me, showing stronger convictions than my own. When did you get to be so mature?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Are you certain it's wise to lower your spear? I thought you hated me wholeheartedly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I do. I can't pretend like I don't. Hatred is not such an easy emotion to let go of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>But conflict—particularly that which robs us of our loved ones and our future—is perhaps the one thing I hate more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Conflict itself? Not those who propagate it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Indeed. So for the sake of the innocent lives we both fight to protect, and so as not to not spawn any new conflict, I will only strike down those I face on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That has been my policy for some time. I simply lost sight of it for a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>For now, it means I will not strike you down. Next time we meet, however...you may not be so lucky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Next time we meet, huh?</td>
</tr>
