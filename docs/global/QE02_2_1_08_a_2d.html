<td>So that's the Central Intelligence Administration. I see...the pompous amount of security definitely makes it stand out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Can we save the chatter for later? That's an incredible amount of Guard Droids!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Plus, the Hounds should be catching up with us soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>In other words, we're blocked off from both sides. Well...either way, we've no choice but to ride in. Might as well make a show of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...I'll be back in a bit. Hide somewhere safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wait, are you gonna try to ride in on your own?! That's way too reckless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Jeez. You're talking to the wrong guy. Save those words for the Guard Droids that are standing in our way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Idiot! This is a facility where they gather information, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What are you gonna do if they order all the Guard Droids around the vicinity to gather here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Who knows? I've got no clue what's gonna happen. You'll have to direct your questions elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Are you serious?! You're totally gonna wing it, aren't you?! Miss, please say something to him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>B-but...the fact is we don't have any other option...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...This way may actually work...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmm... That's a good idea, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ehem. No need to worry about the Guard Droids, aye! We'll take care of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Take care of them? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Bzz... The Guard Droids at this facility work a 24-hour shift.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Most likely...they are charged and exchange information wirelessly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If we can find a wireless route and use his hacking skills...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We may be able to shut down the movement of the Guard Droids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You can actually do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Sure we can! We'll stake our hope on this one chance. That's what it means to be a man, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Heh. Well said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Allie...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>While I jam the radio waves, my movement will become slow, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Fiona, Ronnie, I want you to be on the look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Got it! Edgar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Jeez. With the stakes this high, we can't afford to fail. Good luck, guys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Bzz... We'll stake our hope...on this one chance...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Aye?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What you just...moved me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...Aye!</td>
