<td>That was Santa Claus, wasn't it? Let's chase after him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This time we've got to uncover his identity!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>U-um, yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>O-over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I won't let you escape. Just one blow from my scythe...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>H-hey...don't kill Santa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What speed... He's no ordinary human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I can see him... We can do this! Huzzah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, come on! Seriously, who is this guy...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Fine. This calls for the use of our combo skill!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>All right. My blood is tingling with excitement. No holding back now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(They're out for blood. Will Michael be okay?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>All right, that's a dead end! Rosa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Heheh. Leave it to me. We'll send him crashing down to hell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yikes, this is bad. Rest in peace, Michael.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>H-hey... Lofia! Lofia! Please, stop them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We did it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We succeeded in hunting down Santa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh, Michael, are you still alive? Well, I guess alive isn't the right word to use...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh? Old man Michael?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What? I can't believe it... it's really you. What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Are you...okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ow, ow, ow... The passion of you young damsels is absolutely terrifying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hey, grandpa, what are you doing out here dressed up as Santa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I can't believe you survived our combo attack. You're not the one harboring Santa, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Santa? Hohoho... Since you young ladies were late in coming home, I was ordered to escort you back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Seriously... I don't mind you escorting us, but it's dangerous to appear out of the blue! You should be more careful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Sigh... I wanted to hunt the real Santa Claus, who is both agile and strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(Huh?! They still don't realize? Anyway, I'm impressed Michael survived their full-on assault.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>In fact, maybe it's because he's this charming old man who has us in the palms of his hands that he can play Santa Claus so well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Santa Claus, the mysterious man who travels the sky... Heheh. Next year, we'll hunt him down and expose his identity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hohoho! One can only envy this Santa who is pursued by young ladies such as yourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You should be; because, unlike you, old man, Santa is amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>He was like the manifestation of a scarlet meteor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(Whaaaat...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Anyway, next year let's come up with the perfect plan and try again, Rosa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes. Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well then, young ladies, let's return home and celebrate the holidays.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Everyone is waiting anxiously for your return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Okaaay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Fine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(Heheh. Maybe it's best to keep it a secret.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well then... After escorting the young ladies home, I guess I'll pay a visit to the real Santa Claus and give a report on how this year's mission went.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ah, as for you the Alchemist who has observed all that has transpired, let's keep it between us, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td><br>☆Happy Winter Holiday☆</td>
