<td>002</td>
<td>Daphne, you did it! We—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No! Lady Nicaea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh? Eeeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hmph! Seriously, what did I do to get dealt such bad luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Lady Nicaea! Are you alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Y-yes, I am. Excuse me, sir? You saved my life, but I can't express my proper gratitude without knowing your name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(Darn, I jumped out without thinking! It's way too soon for me to get discovered!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>My name? Who cares? What about those things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You were calling them "leftovers" before. So whose leftovers are we dealing with here, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh no! The ship is shaking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Brzzii! Brziiiiii!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lady Nicaea, behind us! The real deal has arrived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>GRRRRRRR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>GROAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Lady Nicaea! Hold onto Selsieg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Bwriip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Th-thank you, Selsieg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I can't believe a Cursed Beast showed up this close to the ship...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(And just while we were transporting the princess too!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(It's so close... At this rate the ship won't be fast enough to escape! We won't be able to—)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Daphne!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Lady Nicaea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Here, you can ride Selsieg. This is the time to show us what you can do with the Silver Shield!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You can do it, I know you can. You have all the skills to match that shield of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(I can't do this, I really can't! But if I don't do something then the princess and all of the shield regimen will... I-I must do this!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Understood. Let's go, Selsieg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Bwrii!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Deep breaths... I just need to calm down...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I-it'll be fine... I've just got to believe... It'll be just like in practice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(The only way to change our fates is by borrowing the power of the Silver Shield... So I can't fail here!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>"People of Invidia, lend me your strength!" P-please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Grooooooooooaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(No... It's no good... Why can't I draw the magil from the shield?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Is this...the end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Grrrooooooaarrhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>In the nick of time! Valley of Siddim, all outputs stable! Oi, you guys down there! Move back or you'll be caught in the blast zone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>"I embrace the supreme..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>"This world is covered in sin and sinners, yet we embrace virtue and temporarily release the pain."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...Wow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>This light, I've never seen anything like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>A brilliant beam of light that appeared to cut through the raging winds, surging waves, and even a Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaghhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The Leviathan is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It withdrew?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Lady Nicaea! Are you alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ah, I am fine. More importantly, are all the knights okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yes, Your Highness! We were jostled by the waves, but there's no major injuries!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Good, then we must make haste! Attend to Daphne and Selsieg, and get us out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Understood! Anybody with light wounds or idle hands is to help Vice-Captain Daphne! Move, move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>But whatever was that strange light that so suddenly came from the skies above? And moreover—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What happened to that stranger who rescued me before? I cannot spot him anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Phew... That was quite the fright. Out of all the ships in the world, a Cursed Beast just had to attack the ship I was stowed away on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But that reminds me of that one rumor... That must be the air ship with the power to defeat Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>If that thing works as well as I hope it does, it could be rather useful... I guess I'll just have to see what happens next.</td>
