<td>001</td>
<td>Nnngh... I can't believe I'm already awake. It's only three in the afternoon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm usually dead asleep at this time. I must be stressed. There were a lot of intruders yesterday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So there's a vampire living here? If that's true, we should exterminate it before it brings harm to the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yeah, a friend of mine saw it. A female with white hair and skin as pale as a ghost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah, just like that girl there... She had blood soaking her lips red, and...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huff...huff... They're finally gone. I hope this convinces them to stay away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I know this mansion is old, but it's not like there's treasure hidden in here or anything. We don't have anything worth stealing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ohh, ew. I think I got some of their blood on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaagh! A real vampire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, why do they have to call me names like that? I'm not even a vampire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I was hoping to get some quality alone time while she's off resting, but...I'm about to lose my mind here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I might not be so lonely if mother were here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>N-no! I shouldn't say that! Mother is working so hard for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm an adult now. I can't be dependent on mother or anyone else anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I just need to...um... I know! I'll make friends! But how?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Maybe I can meet some friendly people if I go outside? Ugh, but it's so bright out. It's making me dizzy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...Hm? Who's that over there? Another intruder?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh! Perhaps it's the owner of the mansion? I should probably go say hello.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hello! I'm Alyu, a merchant from Lustburg. Pleased to make your acquaintance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh, um...hello.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(I guess she hasn't heard the rumor about me being a vampire.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>My name is Cordelia. I live in this mansion. May I ask what you are doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I was on my way back home from a business trip when I passed by this mansion, and I couldn't help but stare in awe of it. That's when I noticed a plant in your garden that I've never seen before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I wanted to get a closer look at it, and...well...I know it's bad manners, but... I'm so sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh, no, it's fine. Is this the plant you were looking at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's the one! I'm a connoisseur of sorts, but I've never seen anything like that before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I didn't know such a rare thing was in our garden... I rarely leave the house because I don't much care for the sun, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What a waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I have just the thing for you! Let me show you my catalog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>These glasses completely shut out and reflect sunlight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>People around you might not appreciate the reflected light, and these might not be the most stylish, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>These are the thickest lenses I've ever seen! Will I even be able to see through them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well, how about this? It's an alchemical hood! It's enveloped in a small quantity of Alchemia, which helps protect you from sunlight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's very effective, but you might look like a member of some dangerous cult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This might help isolate me from sunlight, but...wouldn't it isolate me from society as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You...don't like them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, um... S-sorry. I'm sure they function exactly as intended, but aesthetically...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>If that's the case, I can go find plenty of other products! I'm quite confident in my ability to procure great merchandise...I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Heheh. Thank you. I would be glad to welcome more intruders like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Look! The vampire's out of the mansion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Heading out in search of blood, are you?! We'll stake you before you have a chance to bare your fangs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ugh...not again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>And I was in such a good mood, too!</td>
</tr>
