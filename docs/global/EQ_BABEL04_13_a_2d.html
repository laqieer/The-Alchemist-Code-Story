<td>So, you are going to kill me? Is that it?</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Now don't go getting the wrong idea!</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So you were buying yourself time, were you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>

<td>Wow, you look great! Really! You're super hot!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ngh... We're not children anymore, you know—and yet you still act like one. Y-you haven't changed at all. I'm...really not a fan.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You must hate me so. I feasted upon your brother's body. I am doing my very best to destroy what's left of your precious Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>How very sad. Your entire clan is dead, and your domain continues to be desecrated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Does it not make your blood boil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>

<td>There are people I want to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>My brother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>He endured unimaginable suffering, and never once complained. He was always looking out for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That's why, even if I stumble, or fall over...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I know that I can pick myself up again and keep moving forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
