<td>You almost done? We should really get back to hunting down Hidden Ogres.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But...! But Iâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>All right, fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh?</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's...been a while since I've been comforted like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's kind of sad. Well, I'm glad you're done crying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...?!</td>

<td>What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Is it weird that didn't feel like the first time you've pat me on the head? It felt...strangely familiar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Are you sure you're not just imagining it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's not all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Sometimes I hear a voice not my own in my head. I see visions of places I've never seen before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I sometimes feel like I'm not myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yeah, I get what you mean.</td>

<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We've wasted enough time already. We need to get back to our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You are Amane, member of the Third Squad of the Blade Fox. My subordinate. Don't make it more complicated than it has to be. You're not very good at thinking about that stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's true... Wait, did you just insult me at the end there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Look, I don't want to worry about you like this anymore, so can you promise me not to go off on your own like that again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Right! I promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Meals and blades are made to what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>To vanquish all demons who bring pain and suffering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>To bring about blissful days of joy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>With our blades, we will clear the way for Wadatsumi's future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What's up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I just remembered an oath, a promise I made when I was younger. I cannot die until I fulfill that oath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>An oath, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes. Every promise I make is another reason why I cannot die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That is a good thing. Now, shall we get going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Right! Captain Tanosuke, give me your orders!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You being obedient feels kinda weird.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Okay, let's take care of these demons and get back to searching for Hidden Ogres!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You got it!</td>
