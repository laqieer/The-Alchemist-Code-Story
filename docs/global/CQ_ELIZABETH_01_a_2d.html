<td>Pl-please, no more! I have a family that I care about very much, so please excuse me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey! Hold on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Seriously. I just asked him to help me a bit with my experimentation research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I wonder if it's not also the role of a soldier to help me out with my research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh well. I guess I'll have him help then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh, there you are! Hey, Decel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Elizabeth...I'm sorry. I'm busy right now. Let's talk later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Not to worry!Â  It'll finish right away. You just need to taste this delicious medicine. Okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I refuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Decel, I've used your favorite mockle seeds for the taste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's not a matter of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If you drink it and submit a report, I'll be able to reward you from the research fees!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If you insist, I will do anything for you, Decel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What?! Why won't you drink my medicine?! I'm asking you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Look. Just once, I caved in and drank it after you begged me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The report from that day was really good! It's really different when you use someone who has medical knowledge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I was walking the fine line between life and death for a week after that. I did it for the sake of preventing other casualties, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You haven't learned anything from that time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Come on, this time it's gonna be all right! Okay? Okay? Pleeeeease!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>U-um... Excuse me, Lord Decel, but it's time soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Apologies. I'll go soon. I told you, didn't I? I'm busy. I've been called into combat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>In that case, I'll give you this muscle strengthener as a bonus! Ah, I might as well add this magic enhancer too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I've seen that medicine before. I heard that you gave it to a soldier, and his diarrhea wouldn't stop for a week.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You can hardly call that a side-effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Awww! Hey, wait!</td>
