<td>Gerald! Are you alright?!</td>

<td>Forget about me! Make sure not a single knight dies on this battlefield!</td>

<td>B-but your wounds...</td>

<td>I'm fine! That's an order!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Fine... Whatever! Just remember, I'll kill you if you die!</td>

<td>Thank you, Ren. You saved my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I got the assassins. You just concentrate on the battle. Leave the professionals to the professional.</td>

<td>How many freaking people do they have?! This is nuts!</td>

<td>Ha. Are you really the Ren I know? I thought you'd be having a lot more fun than this.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This is a little hard for me...because talking about this was banned in the village and it is still difficult for me to willfully speak about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But I must! You need to know that your father was highly revered among us therians as a hero who was willing to fight and die for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There is not one among us who does not carry that debt of gratitude. However...at the time, the relationship between therians and humans was much worse than it is even now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So a decision was made to continue to keep our distance from the humans. That's why you were treated the way you were before. I have decided that it is time to change that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We are facing something greater than any differences between humans and therians. We are fighting for a way for all in this world to live together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And? You expect me to just believe you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Look at all the therians I have managed to gather. I asked them to come and they did, because they believed they owed that to you after you saved them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Whatever happens... Whatever you decide to believe...we are here to do something about the constructed distance between therians and humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>My dream is to see a future where therians and humans can stand together and laugh together! I will get stronger so that I can be the bridge to that future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That is the purpose I found after we last spoke. I will protect the joy and happiness of those around me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Therefore, we therians are here to support the Scarlet Flame Guard against the army of Greed Dike!</td>
