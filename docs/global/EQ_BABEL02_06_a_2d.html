<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Shuddap.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hell no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Still some fight left in you, huh? Let's break one of her ankles. That oughta take the fight right out of her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Great idea. That should set her straight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Aaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Who the hell are you?!</td>

<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The audacity! To lay hands on a child... I would expect nothing less from dogs of the Holy Order.</td>

<td>Guh!</td>

<td>(He appeared outta nowhere. I couldn't see a thing, seeing as he was draped in shadows. It was like he was wearing a cloak of pitch-black darkness.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Girl, what say you? Do you seek power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(Every fiber in my body told me I had no choice but to answer him.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes... I want power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Then come with me. I will give you what you desire—the power to decimate your enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wh-who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I am Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(The moonlight had cast him in a silhouette.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The savior of the shadows... The Shadow Messiah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The...Shadow Messiah...? I've heard of you. Weren't you fighting Envylia and the Holy Order to restore order upon Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>No, that has never been our objective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Oh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Our true objective lies not in Wratharis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>But in restoring true peace to the world by eradicating the false light that shrouds it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I will usher in a new world order! Where none will be shackled by poverty or wealth! True freedom will finally be upon us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>True...peace... True...freedom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>A revolution given birth by darkness! We, the Shadow Army, shall be the ones to deliver the world unto salvation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Girl, join us, and exterminate those who have wronged you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Lord Zahar, are you seriously considering letting her join us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>She's like a wild mutt! She'll brawl with anyone who locks eyes with her. At least some are lucky enough to escape with only minor bite wounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hm. A wild mutt, you say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Look! It's Ila! C'mon! C'mon, is that all you got?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Shaddap and get back here! I'm gonna pulverize you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Ila...! Over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Raaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Haha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Grrrrr! Raaaawr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Ack! Stop biting me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Heh heh. She's adorable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Are we seeing the same thing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'm referring to the alchemy within her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Corvus, you are to train her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Me?! Train her?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I know of none more suited to the task.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>As you command...but you must see other worth besides her alchemy if you're asking me to instruct her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>She is to be the ark that will carry forth our ambition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>The ark that will spread our will to the rest of the world, once our new order has been established.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>All right, then. I'll get started immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Ila!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You're going to learn our dark arts. Get ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What the hell are you ramblin' on about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I'm saying I'm going to teach you the real art of fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>You're gonna teach me? I would've preferred Lord Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>You think I'm no good, don't you? For starters, you'd better learn your place. Lord Zahar doesn't have time to deal with peons like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>P-peon...?! Shaddap! I'm gonna make ya eat those words!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Ha! You let your rage control you, and your alchemy suffers for it. Learning some humility will serve you well, peon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I ain't no peon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>(He beat me to the moon...and then some.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>(I didn't even get a punch in, or a kick. I couldn't lay a finger on him! Who the hell is this guy?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Dangit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Have you finally realized how weak you really are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Grr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>We'll stop here for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>You've got to crawl before you learn how to walk. Fighting's no different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I'll be waiting in the same spot tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Dangt! I'm gonna show you tomorrow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Hah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>(We sparred every single day.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>(And I got beat every single day, too.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>(But then, one day...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Raaaarrrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>(I've got you now!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>(He blocked it?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Lemme go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Don't drop me like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>You told me to let you go, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Shuddap! I'm gonna make you pay for that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>The shadows whisper to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Ugh, he's rambling like a madman again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Ila!... You're beginning to grow on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Uh... You got a fever or somethin'?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>We'll call it a day. The real training starts tomorrow. Get some rest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>H-Hey! I ain't done yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Corvus, how goes her training?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>She's not bad. Her movements are getting sharper. We can use her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Honestly, she's better than I expected. She shows much promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Heh. I look forward to seeing the fruits of your training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Of course, my lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Lord Zahar, the Holy Guard are making their move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>They have dispatched the Holy Guard knights stationed in Northern Pride to escort a cleric to Wratharis. It appears he will be replacing the current one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>A cleric would have a Philosopher's Stone on him, wouldn't he? I bet it would have a good serving of alchemy stored in it, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Heh heh heh. Corvus, Letitia, get ready to move out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>As you command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Corvus, bring Ila with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>But she's not—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>What better place than the battlefield to let her off leash?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>They're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>It's the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Ila!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Lord...Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>You have my permission to go on a rampage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>All right! Lemme at 'em!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Lord Zahar! It's an ambush!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Time to die, Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Lord Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Are you hurt, my lord?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>I'm sorry I'm late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>So, this is the great and mighty Zahar, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Spica, we can talk after. First, we make a meal of these holy curs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Yessir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>I'll lend a hand, too!</td>
