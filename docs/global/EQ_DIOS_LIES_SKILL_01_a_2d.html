<td>Ooooh... What should I do?</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Her Highness granted me permission to give Asmodeus to Dias...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But whenever I lay eyes on him, I get so flustered! I need to come up with some small talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There's actually so much I want to say to him...but my heart just starts beating like crazy...and my mind goes blank.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Plus, I haven't seen him since...that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He smelled...so nice then, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>—No, never mind that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>How do I really feel about him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hmm... Oh, I've got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I just have to get him here! If it worked with Alma and Rebecca, then this time shouldn't be any different!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This is where...we all started seeing...eye to eye. It's where we finally became friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That day... I looked into the ice mirror, but I didn't see Dias. Will I see him this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>They say that true love never dies. Can I honestly say that's how I feel about him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well... There's no point mulling it over any longer! The Stub Rules flower will show if he truly is my heart's desire. Time to go find it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But then again... It'll be hard doing this on my own. Maybe I should ask Alma and Rebecca to come along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No, what am I saying?! They barely came out of our last sky skirmish alive. I can't endanger them again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This is my own problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I can't believe I even considered pestering them for help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's right... This is supposed to be a no-magic zone... I'm sure they'll let me off; I mean, this is a do-or-die situation after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What the heck?! It just won't stay down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>ROOOOOOOOOAR!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Lisbeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You all right? Man... You're hopeless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Dias...? What are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I figured I'd take a last-minute tour to see if I missed anything worthwhile in Lustburg before leaving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Lisbeth, care to tell me why you're here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, um... I came here looking for the Stub Rules flower! It only grows deep in the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>This couldn't wait? Didn't you just survive the last battle by the skin of your teeth? You need to give yourself time to recover.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Wouldn't searching for it after you're back in peak physical shape be bet—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No! It's got to be now! There won't be any point later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(You'll be gone soon...and I need to know how I really feel about you!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Alright then... Lead the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Well? I'll see for myself what's so astonishing about this flower. There must be a reason you want it so badly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Besides, you're always giving everything 110%. Maybe I'll even pick one out just for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Dias... I don't know what to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Now that we're committed, shall we deal with this lot first?</td>
