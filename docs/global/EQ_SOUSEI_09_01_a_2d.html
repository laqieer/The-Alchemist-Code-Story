<td>001</td>
<td>It was just a promise made between children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It isn't right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I know it isn't! Sacrifice?! Emmel, why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There are so many other people here in the village! Tons of people way better at Spiritbonding than we are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But...this is just the way things are here in the village, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Only certain people have what it takes to become the Vessel of Purification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And this time, it's me. It was decided before I was even born. This is my destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's not true! I heard it was supposed to be Eulalia, but she can hear the voices of the spirit... You know, of the dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So the chief said that because that makes her too valuable to sacrifice, it would be you instead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So, you'd rather...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No, I... I don't want Eulalia to be sacrificed either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But I really don't want you to be sacrificed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Okay. But so what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What do you mean, so what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We fought in circles like this for ages. But in the end...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Fine, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Then I'll change it! You say this is just the way things are? That this is how things have to be? Well, maybe so, but that just means they need to be changed, so I'm gonna change 'em!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Really, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I promise! I'm going to grow stronger—even more powerful than the village elder! I'm going to make a world where nobody ever needs to be sacrificed! Where we won't need any more Vessels!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's my dream, okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And just like that—just like always—our fight ended with the echoing sound of my brother stomping out of the room.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Off to change the world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I swear! He's so childish. Was he trying to comfort me, or annoy me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's what I thought at the time, but thinking back on it now, that sentiment of his...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It was an impossible promise. Yet, knowing he meant it from the bottom of his heart really saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Where...? Ngh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Emmel?! So good to see you awake! Don't move yet, though, or you'll hurt yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Eu...lalia? Where...am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We're a ways out from...Hierosolyma? I think that's what the city was called. It's the capital of Superbia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>How much do you remember? We were brought here through Quence's Space-Time Manipulation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Quence's... What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh, no, Nimul! Is he—? Nffffffffgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I told you not to move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Good to see those eyes open, boss! How are you feeling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Awful, if I'm being honest. You're the one who brought us here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yeah. We made it out by a hair's breadth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What's the status of the Cursed Beast cores?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ah! I... What?! No! The power of the Cursed Beasts I took into myself... It's all gone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ah, crap. Good thing I got us outta there when I did, then. That thing musta been the complete package after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wh-what exactly does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It means that everything is going just as my father planned. The preparations for the Ceremony of Creation are complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Helene! I'm glad to see you're okay as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yes, I'm fine, though my brother isn't quite so lucky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ignacio...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>He's alive. That's the best I can say for him right now. But he sure won't be regaining consciousness anytime soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What should we do with him? Should we just kill him now and get it over with?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hey, now, don't give me that look! Didn't he betray you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That's a pretty standard punishment for traitors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Eulalia, could you heal him, please? My brother's Alchemy has likely left him with considerable injuries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...All right. If you insist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Are you...certain? I am... I'm grateful for your mercy, but...he did try to kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Right now, I think we have more important things to worry about than individual grudges. Wouldn't you agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That's not how people usually react, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Even if they understand the circumstances, they persist in their hate. Even when they know there's nothing to be gained by holding a grudge, they refuse to forgive. Isn't that how this usually goes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...But it wasn't my brother he aimed to kill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It was me. If it were Nimul he'd attacked, maybe I'd... But, no, it wasn't. So I have no problems looking the other way, for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What...are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Besides which, Nimul only hurt him in the heat of passion. I'm sure he regrets it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>He wants to save everyone, after all. Hurting people is against his nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>So all this pain and grief that was caused here today...I can forgive, and forget.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>And I can extend that grace to anyone who will stand at my brother's side, even if they happen to be my enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I remember I once said you were arrogant, just like Father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yes, you did, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I humbly retract those words. In actuality, I don't really know what you are. I can't even entirely understand you. You're just very...peculiar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>P-peculiar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Perhaps I just don't know enough about the world to know any better. But I really do think you're a peculiar person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...I don't know what to say to that. I'm not trying to be different. This is just who I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Hey, Quence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What is it? I don't particularly want to talk to you any more than I have to, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You really dislike me that much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I'm someone who always follows his heart, no matter what, and you're kinda the exact opposite. Just one look into your eyes and it's plain as day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Nothing worse than talking about real issues with somebody when they've got their head in the clouds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Well, somebody's certainly grown up to be a sourpuss. Not to worry, though. Your flaws don't bother me at all. I can rise above them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>All right. So, what do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I've been wondering. Everything up till now has come to pass through the machinations of the Infinite Serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>But it's unclear what exactly the Serpent's plans are for Nimul. What do you all even want from him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>No idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I might've said something about this before, but I really just jumped on this bandwagon after someone else had gotten it going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I'm in it for the journey, and frankly don't really care about the destination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>So...you're useless, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>How rude! There are countless other ways you could have put that, you know. I saved your lives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I can answer your question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Here in the land of Pride, our greatest desire is one that we believe Nimul can help fulfill through the Ceremony of Creation: to shatter the Shell of the World.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Shatter the Shell of the World...? You mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Yes. The sky that we see from here is not the true sky. It is a mere veil created by the one who controls this world: Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>So long as it exists, no matter how we thrive, this world will never truly be ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Ouroboros...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>But Ouroboros is the one who maintains this world. All of the Belt Regions are her domain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Yes. She does oversee this world, as it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>But that doesn't mean she cares about it, or wants to help it out in any way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Ouroboros has only one goal: to keep the world from changing any more than it already has.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>That's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Not so different from what you want, is it, Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>The dragons who came before us devised the Ceremony of Creation to return this broken world to its original star form. It is a ceremony of revolution and rebirth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Its purpose is to provoke change, which is something Ouroboros simply cannot abide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>It goes against her nature—her very being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>But the immutable nature of the world no longer serves any purpose. We need more than stasis now. Unfortunately, the sheer scale of the problem makes it a complicated one to address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Yeah. It's kind of like we're all trapped in an enormous egg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>And in order for us to be born, that egg's gotta hatch. Only, the shell is too hard for us to crack it without using some really special tools.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>So that's where Nimul comes in, I guess. He's like the pointy beak that we've been sharpening for this exact purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>But all of that just begs the question: What now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I say, in for a penny, in for a pound. I'm ready to see this thing through to the end, no matter what you've got in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>The world's gone...all white. I... Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>——! ...——!!! ——!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Waginau? Ugh. What are you even—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Zafeiris is—! Use—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Wait... Wagi—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>——...! ——!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Wake up, Adaleigh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Gnaaaaaaaaaaah?! Get away from me, you old—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Huh? Wait, what's...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Waginau saved us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Uh. What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>He and his live-in dragon phantom protected us from the Light of Judgment. That's the only reason we're both still alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>What?! But... Aaah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Waginau? Waginau saved us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>We should not waste his sacrifice. Let's find Nimul, and quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Sacri...? Haha. You're... You're kidding, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>You have to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>There's...no one else here. Not even enemy soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Don't tell me... That light, it... Did it...? Everything?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Here we are. This is the deepest point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Wh-what the... What's happening here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Adaleigh. Look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Nimul! Thank goodness you're oka—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Stay back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Nimul? Come on, what're you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>No. This... This isn't what...I wanted...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Nimul?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Adaleigh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>This magil... The Cursed Beasts...? Nimul... You didn't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Yna... Stay away... Stay away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Argh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>I can't...control the cores... Nrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>I hadn't expected this. The cores...of seven...Cursed Beasts... They're all interfering with one another...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Wait, Nimul! If that's the power of the Cursed Beasts, then—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Ngh! This pressure... This power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Old dog...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Could you...please not right now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Taurus' Anti-Curse... It's having no effect?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>No... Yna, this magil, it's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>It's not...of the Cursed Beasts... They were never anything more...than vessels...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Ngh... Go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>He converted physical matter into magil and...consumed it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>No. The Truth of this world cannot allow for us to approach this stone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Alchemy is the same. This stone... It understands. It is aware that this world is made of magil. Or rather...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>You...created it? That is what grants you the right to change this world? I...see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>What are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Just...get rid of the stone! If you keep this up, it's not going to end well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>I can't... This stone, it's... It's like it's stuck to me now. The ceremony... It's starting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Adaleigh, can you reach him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Of course! And we're going to stop him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Stop...me...?</td>
</tr>
