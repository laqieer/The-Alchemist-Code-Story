<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Y-You won't listen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hmm... I thought you were some spineless child, but you got sand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I won't back down. I came all this way for everyone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I used my map to come all this way with everyone to find The World's Most Fragile and Precious Treasure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The World's Most Fragile and Precious Treasure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hey, isn't that from The Adventures of Joe Vandelle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What? Oh, um... Y-Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This cave is from those stories?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Y-Yes. I've always wanted to find this place, so I researched a great deal. I'm sure I'm right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That story about a treasure no one has ever recovered... It's hidden in a dank cave like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hahaha! I see! That's how it is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're a special one. You don't think of stories as just stories, but you go looking for the treasure yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're a toughie. How about you come with us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Gormalas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ah, you're here. Excellent timing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Step back from Su Yi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hold on. Don't you care to hear her response?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>A response?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Indeed. What do you think? I would really put smarts like yours to use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I won't come. I'm... a pirate of the Xiao Shenmei crew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I see. Well, if you're not interested, I can't fix that. Here you go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Is it all right, Captain? You're just giving back the map?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes, yes. I don't need this treasure. It's yours if you want it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But next time we meet, it'll be as pirates. Don't expect mercy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And until then, put some meat on those bones! Eat a sandwich!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>O-Okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(Oof, he was scary... I'm still shaking.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(So that's the pirate Gormalas.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Su Yi, are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Are you hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>N-No, I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Su Yi! We pursued the monsters, but a cave in kept us from getting back quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We managed to clear the rocks and get back, but... I'm sorry. We put you in danger leaving you alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It must've been terrifying. I'm truly sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Shenmei... Liu Shen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Thank you for being concerned about me, but I'm okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I'm okay because I'm a pirate, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>This is the deepest recess of the cave. If there's a treasure, it's here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hey, you two! Look! Look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh my! There're so many flowers! Their petals are shimmering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>They are... It's almost like starlight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The World's Most Fragile and Precious Treasure... It makes sense now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I've heard of this. There are flowers that can only bloom in the soil and climate of deep caves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It's the alchemy of earth, where petals sparkle as bright as jewels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>But they can only thrive in this environment. Once they're taken outside, they wither and die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>So as stories have been passed down, this beautiful sight has become the treasure of legend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Seems so. No wonder Gormalas lost interest. You can't take this with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>No... I don't think he lost interest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>He even remembered the title of the book! I'm sure he was grateful to find this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That makes sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>This is The World's Most Precious Treasure that Joe spoke of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>How lovely...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Thanks to Su Yi, we've found this amazing treasure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm sorry it's not a treasure we can take with us, Shenmei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What're you talking about? We'll carry this with us in our hearts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>This is priceless! There are few treasures as great as this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Oh, Shenmei...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But there are even more treasures that await us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>With Su Yi's maps, we can go anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...! We can go anywhere...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>(My maps really did help the others out. In that way, I too...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>(I may not be strong, but by doing what I'm good at, I can pull my own weight like everyone else.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Absolutely! I'll do my best!</td>
</tr>
