<td>The closer we get to Lustburg, the more I hear stories about Santa Claus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Still, few people have actually seen him. Most people just laugh it off as a fairytale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We've no promising leads, so let's just give up. Anyway, other than the houses of the underprivileged, we know that the dad is usually the one who plays the role of Santa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No. We've come this far! Until I enter Lustburg and search for him myself, I won't give up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>My pride won't allow me to give up on my prey prematurely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What are you two getting so worked up about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I feel like any further pursuit of this will just end in fatigue. I'm heading back first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Fine. There's no point in having someone who doesn't share our motivation. Shayna and I will continue on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Of course! We're gonna catch Santa Claus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Jeez. You two ladies really get along well, don't you? Well, I'm going home now. See you later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>By the way, Rosa, why are you so interested in Santa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, he travels around the world alone, so I'm sure he practices some form of self-defense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>In other words, there's a high probability he has a weapon that I'm not familiar with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I see! I also reached the conclusion that Santa Claus must be strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Heheh. It appears this is no longer a search for Santa, but a hunt for him. I won't stop until I draw blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We must always challenge those who are strong! Come on! Let's go!</td>
