<td>Huff huff, is everyone all right?</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We're fine, but it got away...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Seems like the chocolate eggs are the target, so it probably won't be leaving anytime soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If it can even use high-grade potions, then we're all in grave danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't worry, we'll work this out somehow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A faint alchemia trace...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So its possible to know who the caster is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, more or less.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're picking this up very quickly Soren, I'm impressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>All you have to do is focus and synchronize your alchemia with it, and you'll be able to follow it back to the source!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Wow! That's incredible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Time to apply myself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Focus...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Could it be...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Soren, how is it going? Any clues?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The source of the trace leads back to Minerva's house...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>She's in charge of creating the chocolate eggs this year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Right, and I noticed something unusual there too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There was a Ratty that was constantly shrinking as it continued to nibble on one of the chocolate eggs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So the beast, is actually preventing us from shrinking as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I have a good feeling I know the beast's identity...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But let's not jump to conclusions, we'll need a plan to capture it.</td>
