<td>This is the second time you've come flying into my arms. You're a strange one, aren't you?</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>The situation is different this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You're trying to broker peace with Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>True. Who would've thought things would turn out like this? Hehe... If my past self could see me now, he'd have a fit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You see? People can change.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ah. There's one thing I wanted to ask you. Do you understand the power contained within your eye?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>My eye...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Now that I think about it...you said something similar the first time we met at the Gilrack Ruins.</td>

<td>He didn't even turn to look at the crystals of wrath.</td>

<tr>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sabareta gazes into Agatha's left eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It may be the eye of an angel that leads this world to light...or the eye of a devil that brings about disaster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, you wish for a Babel that is at peace, so I pray it's the former.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>L-Lord Sabareta! We've received a report from our scouts! One Paladin from the Holy Guard is already closing in on us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Tsk. It appears our leisurely conversation is over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The Holy Guard! It must be Dias!</td>
