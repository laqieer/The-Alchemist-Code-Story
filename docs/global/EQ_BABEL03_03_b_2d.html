<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Carla? Um... What? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Is that information necessary for you to know? Are you telling me that you are ready to take on more responsibility? My, how reliable you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I-I would never be so bold as to even think myself sufficient support for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>In that case... Well, I simply wish for you to provide her with assistance when she is in need, though I hope such a time never comes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Of course, magnificent sister! I apologize for being such an unworthy brother. I hope that in time, I may become someone you are be able to rely on more often!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I wish to help you in any way I can. You are always taking all of the burden upon yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I am touched by your concern, Ramses, but there are things you do not need to be burdened with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is my burden to bear. Do not let it concern you. I only need you to go now, to Carla.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Are you still disinclined to do so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>For reasons I do not know, you ask me to protect someone who is not even nobility. I understand she is the head of a mercenary guild—a vigilante leader, even, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I am very disappointed, Ramses... Was it a lie when you told me you wished to help me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>N-no! Of course not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm counting on you, Ramses. Do not let me down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Y-yes! I'm on my way now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Go now, Ramses. There is no reason for you to bear the burdens that I must carry on my own shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Retreat. We must revise our strategy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hmph. This is it for us as well. We now know where to find you. Come, Zofia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Zofia, wait! There's no need for you to do this! There are other things you can fill your days with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You can make friends; go out and play with them! There are so many more things you can do instead of fighting as a slave to this fiend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Above all else, I can't bring myself to fight you! We promised, remember?! We were gonna go eat some good food together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Bean soup, remember?! Don't tell me you forgot! We're friends now, aren't we?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Zofia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Gosh darnit, why are they even after me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Good! You are unhurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ramses, thank you. I'm just wondering: Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I do not have the answer to that. The angel of this desert, my own dear sister, refused to give me any information. If she had not implored me to do so, I would never aid the likes of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Your sister asked you to...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes. She requested that I protect Carla.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Nefertiti definitely knows something. I knew she was hiding something! She's being so—dangit... N...n...negligent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>How dare you speak of her like that! She is not negligent! She is charged with so much more than we can ever fathom, and she's doing it all alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh? Well...I guess you're probably right. Sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So the desert is under attack again. This is bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Balt...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(I have to keep Carla safe. She is the future of this desert!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(I will never again lose my way. I will keep my promise to you, Hawk!)</td>
</tr>
