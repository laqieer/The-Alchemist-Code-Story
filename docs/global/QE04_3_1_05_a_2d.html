<td>You dare say we burden nature?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No...we have not abandoned our responsibility! We live by our own hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Exactly. That's how we learned of the danger to Saga and are now fighting for our future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What would an outsider like you know about any of this?! I've heard enough nonsense from you, you invader!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Of course, you wouldn't understand...you fools! Don't you realize it was your own foolishness that brought about this situation?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't listen to him! He's trying to invade Saga. Of course, he's just speaking nonsense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I know, Lisbeth! His words don't deserve our attention!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Whether you heed my words or not is up to you. I merely inform you out of respect for the strength you have shown me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Shut up! Enough with your arrogant talk, you invading scum!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hyahahahaha! Don't you understand how incongruous your words are coming from one who claims to respect the natural order of things?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Survival of the fittest! That is the law of nature!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? If you wish to resist invasion, then you must prove it with your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's why I am now proving to you my strength! I am not a weakling; I am invincible! Proving this is my justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If a country is invaded and destroyed then that's all there is to it. Since the time of creation, how many races and countries do you think have perished?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>In this world, only the strong remain! That is what history is all about! Whatever tribe may perish, I will not perish...that is my revenge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...Your revenge?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hmph. I got a little worked up and let a little too much slip. There's no need for you to know about that. Well then, let's continue. Let's decide which of us will survive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Under no circumstances will I tolerate your interpretation of justice! You used the Jam to take countless lives...you will not be forgiven!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh? So, you've picked up on the movement of the Jam. That wasn't my idea...but, although it may be cowardly, it's an effective plan...and that's what matters in war!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I will not let you do to Saga as you please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Don't let him get to you, Tina! We have no way of defeating him like this. We need to think of a plan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But what kind of plan? I doubt he'll let us escape alive. More importantly, we don't have any time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Lisbeth is right. We'll just have to find a way out of this. Survival of the fittest, huh? He might have a point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If so, in order to protect everything, I will become more powerful right now! I will not allow Saga to be consumed! I will protect it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The only reason why I can stand here now is because of you Mocca, Lisbeth, and everyone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I will not let all of you lose your lives. I will be the strength that protects all of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Tina...?! But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Don't worry. It's taken some time, but I've gotten a read on Georgios' movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I will use every last ounce of my strength...I will protect you, Mocca, Lisbeth and all of Saga!!!</td>
