<td>Why didn't the Lovesickness disappear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Uhhhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I guess it's piped down a bit, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We've gotta do something about my affliction first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They did defeat those monsters, and for that I'm glad, but then they brought an even bigger one along...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh! N-no, you see, this is, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Never seen clothes like that before. Maybe they're monsters, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Shh! We'd best avoid getting involved with that lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What's going on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh... That lady...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Might she not be a Killer Princess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I see. I think I've got a handle on things now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We've got to resolve this...romance as quickly as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Y-yes, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We can't be expected to just fall in love! And he's my brotherâ€”I shouldn't be involved in this at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I am so relieved to have someone who hails from the same world as I do by my side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I've never seen her before in my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I arrived in this land some time ago... Now, I act as guardian to this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There are far too many people here who are tempted by the sweet nectar of lust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>L-lust...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I shall help you, although it goes against my better judgment. I cannot help but be suspicious of dangerous emotions such as love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There's no telling when that Lovesickness will bring enemies into our midst again, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's true, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That man... What strange clothes he's wearing! Disgraceful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Are they talking about me? I guess we must be in a different time, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That monster won't go turning into a bug, will it? There's that boy, too... I hope they leave soon, afore that happens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The wind's kinda strong here, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Shut your mouths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Listen to yourselves. Judging people based solely on their sex simply because of your society's matriarchal ways... I cannot abide it. You ought to be ashamed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Let not lust cloud your minds, but think for yourselves. Are love and desire really so important to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Heed me now, for I am telling you that the love of these people is necessary not only for the sake of this nation, but for the peace of this continent in its entirety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That is why I must ask you to leave them to resolve their love as swiftly as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I will be the one to decide whether their love is steeped in the base emotion of lust or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Um... Hello? Need I remind you that I am his sister?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>All of this is just too sudden! We can't just fall in love because we're told to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>C-can't we just...pretend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>If you are going to do this, if this is truly your solution, then you ought to be sincere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>R-really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I would prefer you to resolve this issue as quickly as possible, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>H-hey! There's no need to draw your bow! Point it somewhere else, will you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>T-Tinnie! What do you think about all this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hmm... I'm not sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Urghhh! I can't stand this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>P-put your sword away! Aaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Okay, then. Now that we've got the part where you threaten me out of the way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Would you...be my girlfriend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Fine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Oh, dear! It appears we have ourselves a love triangle... And a forbidden one, at that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>W-wait! Hold on a second! We've gotta talk this through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>How do you feel about this, Lady Artemis? Is this...inappropriately lustful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Let's wait and see how things unfold for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What, is this an experiment to you or something?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Motion to dismiss, denied! Lady Artemis, our judge for today, has spoken! The trial will proceed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Tinnie... Are you actually enjoying this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Oh, my, no. What a ridiculous thing to say!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>U-um...! I... I d-don't want to do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The defense's statement could not be heard, and has thus been omitted from the record!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hiiragi, gentle and sweet; or the spice of forbidden love, his own sister, Mira... This will certainly be a difficult choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Tinnie... Who are you talking to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Why, to the Lovesickness, of course! We must ensure that it bears witness to the blossoming of their love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>How can you take this crazy situation so seriously?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>With her pale skin, as white as a marshmallow, and being both tender and welcoming in spirit, one cannot help but want to protect sweet Hiiragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Beneath Mira's bright and lively exterior lurk desires for her twin and other half, making her daily life alongside but not astride him agonizingly tantalizing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>How love flourishes in extreme circumstances... You won't be able to look away from this head-to-head battle of two girls against one boy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Jeez, Tinnie! You're really having fun with this, aren't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>O-of course not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>If we can just get this romance to go off without a hitch, we can go home, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Well, yes, but tonight is out of the question! We have got to keep our eyes peeled!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Come to think of it, you haven't been this hyper since that time you ate marshmallows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Her heart already pledged to the object of her affections, Almace is free to enjoy the thrills of being a spectator!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Huh?! The object of my...?! I'm not...! I don't...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Of course, I'm not planning on telling anyone that your heart lies with your master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>T-Tinnie! Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>So... Are the two of you going to fight over me now? Love is such a conundrum, isn't it? Ahh, I am a sinful, sinful man, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Meanwhile, Nyx is feeling on top of the world and being terribly impertinent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>More like incredibly irritating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Please be gentle with me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>(This is more difficult than I thought.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>(Is it normal to be so embarrassed about this?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
