<td>Mammon's greed for someone even more suitable than I forced a full-blown war of succession to unfold—a war of the backstabbing and poisoning sort.</td>

<td>But the outcome of this war was decided well in advance. For you see, I was thrown a bone, and granted immortality. This didn't make things nearly as easy on me as one might think, however.</td>
