<td>Whoa! Seems like everyone and their dog is out and about today. And they all look so...happy. The Winter Holiday will do that to you, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>But I can't afford to get swept up in all this festive cheer! I'm on duty. The people's lives are depending on me! Let's see... What's everyone else up to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, I'm done for the day. I made sure all those presents found their recipients!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Already?! No way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yup! Icona's a real whizz with the schedule. It would've taken hours longer without her help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh, don't mention it! I was just trying to be efficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey, um...I've been thinking. When we're all finished for the day, why don't we have a party to celebrate the Winter Holiday?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>A party, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sounds good to me. It'll be something to look forward to after a long day of hard work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'll have my group start getting things together for the party as soon as we've finished putting up the decorations around town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's basically tradition by now, isn't it? I hope this year's Winter Holiday party will be just as fun as the last!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh. You guys have fun with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But I have to ask...what's so special about this Winter Holiday? Everyone in town seems so excited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, of course they are! This is a magical time of year!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Exactly! It's a time to be spent with friends and loved ones; a time of joy and good cheer. It's special in every way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh? You don't say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Loved ones...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Good...cheer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What's that, Ishuna? You're mumbling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, uh, I didn't say anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You'll join us for the Winter Holiday party too, won't you, Icona?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Me? I don't know... It's not really my thing. I was hoping to spend the evening tinkering with this incantation gear I found while on the job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh... That's a shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yeah... How about you, Ishuna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Who, me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We're reaching out to everyone still on duty. I think Lofia and Michael in Lustburg will be able to make it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>And Glanz and Rochelle are in Wratharis, but they should be coming too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Wait... Glanz and Rochelle are going to be there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why did you come back? You betrayed us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You sold the Unicorn Knights out, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes, I think so. How about you? Will you join us? The more, the merrier, as they say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Sorry. I didn't mean to strong-arm you into coming. You can say no, if you're not in the mood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, no, don't apologize! I don't feel pressured or anything. I appreciate the invite, and...I'll swing by if I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Glad to hear it. I hope to see you there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But if those two are going, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I dunno...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hey. Ishuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Y-yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You should have been honest with her. What's the point of getting her hopes up if you have no intention of going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You'll feel bad, and she'll feel let down... Dishonesty is inefficient for both sides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I-it's not like that! I wasn't lying or anything. I just haven't made up my mind yet, that's all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Besides, I do actually want to go. I'm just not sure about the, um...timing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You don't have to explain yourself to me. I was just telling it as I saw it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Besides, at the end of the day, it's up to you. Whether you choose to go or not is none of my concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>True enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(Geez... Icona's a weird one. I'm not sure what to make of her sometimes.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Uh, do you hear that? Sounds like something's going on over there...and it doesn't sound good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Uh-oh... We'd better check it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What the heck are you trying to pull?! This isn't what we agreed on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What's going on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well, you see...the peddler is delayed, and so our special Winter Holiday baubles have yet to arrive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ooh, I love those! There's ones with adorable little Rattys with Santa hats on themâ€”some of them even feature the Maruda Tribe! And they sell out crazy fast every year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I mean, no wonder! They're all handmade with love and care, and every little face is unique!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Those are the ones, I'm afraid. I was only able to order in a very small amount to begin with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It's all very strange. This has never happened before! First orders are restricted, and now the items haven't even arrived...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>The peddler might have been robbed. The rarer the item, the higher the resell price, after all. Were any precautions taken to protect them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>W-well, the peddler employs a band of mercenaries, so I'm sure that's unlikely... But at this rate, it doesn't look like I'll be getting those baubles until tomorrow at the earliest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What?! Are you kidding me?! I reserved a dozen of them! They have to be here today! Today, understand?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I promised my kids they'd get a set of those baubles for Christmas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I-I'm terribly sorry, sir, but there's not much I can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Let's all just take a deep breath and cool our heads for a minute, yeah? Yelling at this shopkeeper isn't going to get you those baubles any faster, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You think I don't know that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I know it's not the seller's fault, but...what am I supposed to tell my kids?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Haa... You know what? Fine. It's fine. Good day to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>He clearly doesn't think it's fine, but off he goes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>More importantly, it feels like a shadow has passed over the town, bringing down the mood. When did that happen? It can't all be because of those missing baubles, can it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It could be... I mean, a lot of people were counting on getting those to give as presents for the festive season.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Well... There's only one thing for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I'm going to try and find that peddler!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I-it's the right thing to do, isn't it? Someone has to! We can't just let that guy storm off and make his kids miserable by being in a grumpy mood all day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>They're lucky enough to be able to enjoy this occasion as a family. I want them to have fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>B-besides, I wouldn't want there to be bad blood between him and that seller over something so trivial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I'm quick on my feet, so I bet I can find that peddler and make it back here in good time. I could even deliver the baubles myself, if need be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>It's very kind of you to offer, but...you shouldn't go alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It's really not your place to do this, you know. For one, it'd mean neglecting your duties as a Phantom Soldier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I-I know, but...still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I have to do something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>The Winter Holiday only comes around once a year, and...you never know how many of those you'll get in life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I want to give everyone in this town a chance to really enjoy this precious time with their nearest and dearest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Oh, Ishuna... That's so sweet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>If you'll really be all right on your own, then I say go for it! I'll take over your shift patrolling the town until you return, so you won't have to worry about a thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Really?! Thanks, Lotiyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>A special time, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Achieving endless possibilities for the future, while minimizing the sacrifices required...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I've always believed that this should be my creed as a researcher, but maybe it's time I considered some alternatives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Or maybe they'll come to me naturally as I spend time with other people...people like her. Come to think of it, there are a few components for my machines I've yet to salvage...</td>
</tr>
