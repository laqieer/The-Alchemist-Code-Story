<td>Aaand cut! Did you catch that, folks?! That was a special show just for you, to get you fired up for the Easter celebrations!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Uhh... There's no way that was a show. It was way too realistic. Besides, those guys in masks are clearly being taken into custody as we speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You can't fool me! Those weapons and armor you bear are very clearly not props of any kind! Oh, dear... It seems that this year's Easter is an inauspicious one indeed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Crap... Guess they're not buying it, and I don't blame them. What should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>W-well...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>L-listen to me, everyone! I know that that must have been frightening, but everything is going to be all right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wh-why, you ask? Well, I... I mean... Neica is going to cast her magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Did she say...magic? I think that'd make me feel loads better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The Imperial Easter Egg is all sparkly! It's so pretty! I wonder if the magic will make it sparkle even more?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Are you ready to see some magic in action? Well, here I go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I wish for plentiful harvests for all of Gluttony Foss, and for the excitement from earlier to be resurrected in all of your hearts... Kazam!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wow! It's so pretty! I feel all warm just looking at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What theâ€”?! My scratch is gone! I fell over and scraped my knee earlier, but now it's all better! Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Amazing! Just look at all those smiles!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yep! Looks like everyone's having a blast again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's all thanks to you, Neica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>My powers...actually made people happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>U-um... How about I cast some magic on the eggs everyone found? W-would that be okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, my! Looks like we have another surprise! Neica is going to go around and enchant the eggs from the Egg Hunt for everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I-if you want me to use my magic on your egg, please line up over here, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wow! Thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey, no fair! My egg deserves to be magicked, too! I wanna see Neica's powers up close!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I found an egg, too, y'know! Y-you'll enchant it for me, won't you? It'll be my lucky charm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh, please! Mine, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>J-just hold on! Wait in line for your turn, and I promise I'll get to you as soon as I can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Looks like Neica's having fun! I'm so happy to see her smiling and having a good time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>A festival to celebrate "the resurrection of something dear..." Hmhm. Easter truly is a magnificent holiday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It sure is! Now we all know what this day is really about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Tee hee! And now I know what you're all about, Pam!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You want to go looking for eggs! It's all you can think about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>H-how could you possibly know that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>As for me, I'm itching to try out the food they're serving at the stalls!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well, why don't we enjoy ourselves at the festival for a while, and pick up some provisions for Neica while we're at it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Haa... I think...that's the last one. That took way longer than I thought it would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You did a great thing here today, Neica.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>T-T-Teona! How long have you been standing there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Not very long. I just thought you might appreciate something to eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>O-oh, wow! They were selling all this at the stalls...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I've brought you some meat on a stick, pickled plums, and the ever-popular Colosseum Apple Pie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Th-thank you so much! I really needed this... I'm starving!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You know, I never expected you to use the fact that you're the real Neica like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You really pushed yourself to do your best for everyone, didn't you? I am so proud of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Everyone I passed on my way over here was talking excitedly, thrilled to have had you enchant their eggs for them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>All of them were in agreement that this year's Neica was simply incredible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>When I stood up there...my body just started moving on its own. It was like a part of me already knew what to do. I felt like I was in a dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Ah, yes. I've experienced something similar myself! Now, eat up, and let's go enjoy this festival together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You saved the day, after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Neica! Teona! Hurry up already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Sh-she said..."t-together."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I-I'm so happy! I get to spend the day walking around with Teona! The Teona! Wow, wow, wow! Easter is the best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Happy Easter! We wish you a sweet Easter filled with lots of Easter eggs!</td>
