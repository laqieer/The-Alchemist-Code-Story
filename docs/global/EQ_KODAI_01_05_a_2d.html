<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Wow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh, wow! Wha—?! Wow!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What are you so worked up about? What's so fascinating about this boring old burg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I've never seen so many humans in one place before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And the walls here aren't all cracked and crumbled!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What in the world? Did you used to live in ruins, or something?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Anyway, keep up the pace! Claybelle's is just over this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What? What is it now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I want to go on an adventure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Umm... How about before that, we go to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>There's so much I don't know about! I want to learn more about the humans, and about you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's my duty! Or at least, that's what Schmeier told me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I have to learn about a whole bunch of things if I'm going to save everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hey, you're my friend, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>F-frie—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Y-y-you and me? F-friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hmmmm? We're not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>W-well, you do seem to be a bit ignorant as to the ways of the world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And I suppose it's a witch's duty to guide those who are lost. So, yeah, sure! Why not? We can be friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yay! Does that mean you're gonna show me around?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If you'd like. The people here, including me, certainly owe quite a debt of gratitude to your kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If you really want to know more about this place, then listen up! That over there is the blacksmith's workshop, and that's the store we go to for magical items. Oh, and that one there is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wow... Ooh! What about that one?! What's that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That'd be the patisserie. They sell cakes, but they're so expensive, we only go there on special occasions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>They sell what? What's a cake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>A cake? It's a kind of pastry. Food! It's food. It's baked. It's sweet, and delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But it's their fruity pies that taste the best! That's...another kind of food. A similar one! They're so enchantingly sweet, it's like they melt in your mouth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh, okay. Food that melts. Got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Somehow, I doubt that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You know what? Here. For you. I was saving this for later, but you should try a bite yourself. I think you might like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Tsk, tsk, Ambrosia. Didn't you tell me you had no idea where the last slice of pie I baked went?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Q-Quence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Who's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Nice to meet you, little miss. My name is Quence. I'm sort of a guardian for that one next to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So you're a Zafeiris?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>A Zaf... What? I'm sorry, but I don't speak the dragons' language.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>How did you know she's a dragon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Isn't it obvious? No human can physically house such an immense amount of magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm Lil! I'm Sia's friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, really? Sia's friend, you say? As in, Ambro-Sia? Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Don't give me that look. No, I did not trick her into anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But, a friend? You? And a cute nickname, at that? Is it snowing today, or are these white plumes from the wings of flying pigs I see? Hahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Quence! You're being mean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hahaha! I'm sorry, it's just the first time I've ever heard anybody regard you as their friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You have no friends, Sia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What? No! I-I mean, yes! Are you judging me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It's okay. Schmeier said Zafeiris doesn't have any friends either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I don't know either of those people. That means nothing to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I take it she's lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes. I've been trying to bring her to Claybelle's, considering the fact that she's a dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Really? What do you think our teacher would be able to do for her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Teacher?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oi! Keep that big mouth of yours shut, Quence! We're not supposed to let anyone know Claybelle's teaching us magic, remember?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>"Mere humans must not dare reach for the sagacity of the great dragons," was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Let those envious so-and-sos judge all they want. I don't care what they think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Claybelle recognized our talent, and chose to bestow her knowledge upon us. That's all there is to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Y-you're not wrong, but... Still!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(I just don't want the townspeople bad-mouthing you again...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hmm? What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Ah, nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You two are really close, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Pfft, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Quence is always teasing me. He skips out on all his chores, and is an absolute menace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Oh? What was that? For a moment there, I thought I heard the buzz of a fly that can't even cook for herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Excuse you?! I can cook just fine, thankyouverymuch! I only ask for help so you might have a chance to feel useful, for a change!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Lies! Lies and slander! You know what she told me? She told me she's too scared to even hold a kitchen knife! How can she be so afraid of kitchen implements?! And she calls herself a witch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I never said that! I can use a kitchen knife just fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>See? You two are besties!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What part of our interaction could possibly lead you to believe that, Lil?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Lil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>That's my name! They said it means "ocean"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Enough is enough! This tour is over! I'm taking you right to Claybelle's now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Okay. Thanks, Sia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>S-sure. No problem. What are f-friends for, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Territory of the Seven Sins, the Lust Layer... I believe this is where Claybelle resides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Can't believe she really lives among the humans! We dragons are destined to leave this world soon. She should know better than to fraternize with them so intimately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I will do as I please, Zafeiris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...Long time no see. You seem tired. Schmeier working you to the bone, I take it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Hahaha! Always with the silent treatment! You could at least be polite and say hello.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Anyway, come on in. I prefer to have my conversations indoors, where it's warm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Humans are still immature. We ought to walk side by side with them until they learn from us just how to survive in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Claybelle, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I know, I know. You have no interest in humans. Or, perhaps, what little you do feel toward them amounts to nothing more than self-condemnation and regret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Nail right on the head, I take it? Still regret failing to protect our world, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Mm, it's a touchy subject. My apologies. I shouldn't have even brought it up, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Just know that I care not for the dragons, much as you care...little...for the humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Creation of a new world? Atonement for the future? Leave me out of all that nonsense. I want no part in it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I stick with the humans solely because I personally consider them to be worth my time, interest, and guidance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Amidst that great calamity that enveloped the seven worlds, I was only able to save a scant few with these hands, and they alone are precious to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...Sorry, but did you happen to see a little girl around here recently?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>A little dragon girl. Her name is Lil. Schmeier said she sent her here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>She hasn't visited this home of mine, at least. Why was she sent here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Ophioneus is after her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>That Dragon of Pride, after one little girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Silence is golden, eh, Zafeiris?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Unfortunately for you, your silence is telling me loud and clear that you're hiding something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I take it that little girl is Ouroboros? Which would mean Schmeier finally completed her little project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Her name is Lil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>You've become attached to her, haven't you? Is she not merely a tool for salvation to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>No! She's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Lil...is just a child. She has no drive or determination to save the world. She's just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I mean, is it right to force a child like that to bear the fate of the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Since when do you care what's right or wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Our civilization has come to an end. Our extinction is imminent. And just why do you think that is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>It's because we were "wrong."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I can't say what we were wrong about, specifically, nor would I even entertain the notion that we were wrong about everything. But clearly, we made a pivotal error somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>And where we are now is the result. We have to acknowledge and accept that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>We were wrong, and whatever in blazes we were wrong about, we're long past the point of making it right again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Our only two choices now are either to prevent an even worse wrong from occurring, or to double down on our errors and defy the very fabric of reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Which choice are you picking, Claybelle? Will you defy reality?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>...Are you really that oblivious to the threat encroaching upon this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Come with me. I have something to show you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>You need to come face-to-face with the newest calamity this world is about to suffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Is this a...facility for imprisoning criminals? Why do you have such a place on your property?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Because I can't risk letting those I care for see this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>How would I even explain it to them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Explain what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Haaaaaaaaarrrghhhaaahh...</td>
</tr>
