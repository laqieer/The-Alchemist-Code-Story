<td>Agh! H-he's strong!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Enough, Logi! You're no match for him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>W-wait, dad! Stand back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'll take care of this! Dias took down a Demon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I need to become a knight like him as well! I made that promise to him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Speaking firmly, Logi heads towards the black knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I promised him that I would build a peaceful world where Agatha could be happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I can't keep relying on Dias for everything! I will also do my part in bringing about peace! Huzzah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ssshhh... Hohhh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That black knight...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huff...huff...! Dias... I'm going to keep my promise as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Exhausted, Logi collapses onto his knees. Zeke rushes forward and holds out his hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Are you okay, Logi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ack! Forgive me, brothers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The blood crystals of my people... These Philosopher's Stones must be delivered to Lord Sabareta, so that they may connect to our light of hope!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The 'light of hope'...! Sabareta called the ancient weapon 'the light of hope that will lead the world to chaos'!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So...the Philosopher's Stones are a source of power for the Demon after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We cannot allow this. All knights must dedicate their efforts to finding Sabareta as soon as possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Logi, you return to camp and get your wounds treated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No, please let me go too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's absurd. Your wounds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Both Wratharis soldiers and Dias are fighting this battle with heartbreaking resolve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>These wounds are nothing in comparison! I have resolved myself to take part in Agatha's rescue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Very well. We must hurry. I will leave the Blue Flame Guard under your command. Dedicate all your resources to finding Sabareta and the Demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Do not take any risks. Once you find the Demon, report back to me immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't worry! I'm your son, dad! I will not let them resurrect the Demon! As for Agatha, I will do whatever I can to rescue her!</td>
