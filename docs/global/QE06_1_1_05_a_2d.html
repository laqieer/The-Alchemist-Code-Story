<td>I've heard your report, we've delivered that child to base, and I would love to take a nap right abut now, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>You seem to be having trouble swallowing this situation. You have any questions? I'll answer what I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>What...was that? I've never heard of people turning into demons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>What exactly are demons?! What are we fighting against?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Whoa, slow down. All right, let me answer one at a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Demons are...well, demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>Do you think an answer like that will suffice?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Not at all. You interrupted me before I could say more. You'll be losing points for not being able to listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Also, watch your attitude. That's another point reduction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>Wh-what are you doing? This isn't the time for that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>It most certainly is. Did you forget? You're in the middle of your trial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>I'm...sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Good. Now, you've studied the history of Wadatsumi, correct? There are three major variations of demons. They are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>Pure demons, half-bloods born from a human and a demon, and...demons that used to be human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Exactly. Though currently there are no confirmed cases of half-bloods due to concentrated efforts made in the past to eradicate them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>I've read there was a time when those who were not human were ostracized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Good, good. Glad to hear you're a studious one. So then, what do you make of what you saw today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>A demon that was formerly a human... It can't be that Demon's Blood, the pandemic that nearly destroyed Wadatsumi is...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Negativity, or in other words, corruption can consume people. Those who have been corrupted turn into demons it reacts to some factor found in the people of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>That is what we call Demon's Blood. But now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>We've confirmed that those bit by demons will turn as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>To be more specific, the sentient pure-bloods can amplify the corruption within people to turn them into demons, while the "normal" demons can bite people to turn them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>That's about it, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>Is it safe to assume that this is information the common people do not know? That only the Blade Fox are aware of this truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>That's right. To avoid a massive panic, we've issued a gag order on the matter. Only members of the Blade Fox know this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>So then, some of the demons we have fought against could have been...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Yes. They could have once been an important person to someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>That's horrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>This is information only disclosed to those whom we are sure will continue fighting as a member of the Blade Fox after learning such a truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>There is a regulation that none of you have been told of. A member of the Blade Fox that is bitten by a demon must be purged by their squad before they themselves turn into a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Do you still want to join the Blade Fox? Do you still wish to fight for the people of Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>I see you don't yet have an answer to those questions. Strange, since I seem to remember someone hollering about being the one to bring peace to Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>I still stand by those words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Hmph. Then let me ask you this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Why did you go against regulation and turn your back to a demon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>Because I heard that girl calling out for help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Did you not think of the possibility that one of the other students could die because of your actions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>You don't mean...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Fortunately or not, no one died, but there were casualties. But the possibility existed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>If I must choose between regulations and a voice calling for help, I know which is more important to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>Are you saying I should ignore a life I have the chance to save?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Let one demon go and a hundred lives are lost. Remember that. Your actions were dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>And it caused unnecessary casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>Wh-what the...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Bind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Now, you do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>You know the regulation. A member of the Blade Fox that is bitten by a demon must be purged by their squad before they themselves turn into a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>

<td>What's the matter, Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>Even if they've turned into demons...I just can't!</td>
