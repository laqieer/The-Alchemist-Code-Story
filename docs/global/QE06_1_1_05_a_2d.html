<td>I've heard your report, we've delivered that child to base, and I would love to take a nap right abut now, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You seem to be having trouble swallowing this situation. You have any questions? I'll answer what I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What...was that? I've never heard of people turning into demons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What exactly are demons?! What are we fighting against?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Whoa, slow down. All right, let me answer one at a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Demons are...well, demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Do you think an answer like that will suffice?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Not at all. You interrupted me before I could say more. You'll be losing points for not being able to listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Also, watch your attitude. That's another point reduction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Wh-what are you doing? This isn't the time for that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It most certainly is. Did you forget? You're in the middle of your trial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm...sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Good. Now, you've studied the history of Wadatsumi, correct? There are three major variations of demons. They are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Pure demons, half-bloods born from a human and a demon, and...demons that used to be human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Exactly. Though currently there are no confirmed cases of half-bloods due to concentrated efforts made in the past to eradicate them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I've read there was a time when those who were not human were ostracized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Good, good. Glad to hear you're a studious one. So then, what do you make of what you saw today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>A demon that was formerly a human... It can't be that Demon's Blood, the pandemic that nearly destroyed Wadatsumi is...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Negativity, or in other words, corruption can consume people. Those who have been corrupted turn into demons it reacts to some factor found in the people of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That is what we call Demon's Blood. But now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We've confirmed that those bit by demons will turn as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>To be more specific, the sentient pure-bloods can amplify the corruption within people to turn them into demons, while the "normal" demons can bite people to turn them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's about it, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Is it safe to assume that this is information the common people do not know? That only the Blade Fox are aware of this truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's right. To avoid a massive panic, we've issued a gag order on the matter. Only members of the Blade Fox know this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So then, some of the demons we have fought against could have been...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes. They could have once been an important person to someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That's horrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>This is information only disclosed to those whom we are sure will continue fighting as a member of the Blade Fox after learning such a truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>There is a regulation that none of you have been told of. A member of the Blade Fox that is bitten by a demon must be purged by their squad before they themselves turn into a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Do you still want to join the Blade Fox? Do you still wish to fight for the people of Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I see you don't yet have an answer to those questions. Strange, since I seem to remember someone hollering about being the one to bring peace to Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I still stand by those words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hmph. Then let me ask you this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Why did you go against regulation and turn your back to a demon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Because I heard that girl calling out for help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Did you not think of the possibility that one of the other students could die because of your actions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You don't mean...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Fortunately or not, no one died, but there were casualties. But the possibility existed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If I must choose between regulations and a voice calling for help, I know which is more important to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Are you saying I should ignore a life I have the chance to save?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Let one demon go and a hundred lives are lost. Remember that. Your actions were dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>And it caused unnecessary casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Wh-what the...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I told you. Casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>If only I had been there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Bind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Now, you do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You know the regulation. A member of the Blade Fox that is bitten by a demon must be purged by their squad before they themselves turn into a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What's the matter, Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Even if they've turned into demons...I just can't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Even though you had no problem cutting down that little girl's mother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>"I hate demons."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>"Demons must be eradicated."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(What is this overwhelmingly dark feeling? It's different from before...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>"Unforgivable."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>"They took everything from me."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Demons must be eradicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>That's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Urgaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Forgive me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>As your proctor, I should disqualify you from this trial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>But, personally, I don't disagree with your instinct to save the girl and your compassion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Or with why you would hesitate on this matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I do not regret anything I did. But it is true that all of this tragedy is a result of my own actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What am I to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You must live. You are not allowed to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>To pay for the harm you've done, you must bring peace to Wadatsumi. Wasn't that your mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>It is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Then you must live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Thank you, Captain Tanosuke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Aw, don't thank me. It makes me feel weird. I get all sneezy when people thank me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Achoo! Achoo! Aaaahchoo!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Whaâ€”! I was being serious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Those of us who survived should at least be smiling. Don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Is something the matter, Captain Tanosuke?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ah, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>?! Another demon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>So you've noticed. The trial is still going, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Oh, geez!!! That freaked me out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>You weren't expecting a fair fight on the battlefield, were you? You should learn to never let your guard down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Need a hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Back off! I can handle it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Demons must be eradicated!</td>
</tr>
