<td>Whenever mom is crying, I curl up in a ball in my room so that nobody knows I'm there.</td>

<td>I keep very quiet when she's angry. As long as I put up with it until she's satisfied, everything'll be fine.</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>This is my punishment for having been born. After all, I'm the reason mom is miserable.</td>

<td>(When mom died, I was taken in by my cousin Eve's family--her and her mom.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(They're both so kind and they have a great relationship with each other, which is strange to me.)</td>

<td>I don't think my mom ever loved me--even until the day she died.</td>

<td>(My aunt went out this morning, so I guess that means it's just me and Eve.)</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(We haven't really talked much, so it's still a bit awkward…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(But I'm pretty sure she'll head out soon. She never misses a day of training. She has a lot of energy.)</td>

<td>Hey, Moa! It's such a nice day today, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>

<tr>

<td>N-Not really!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>WHAT? I do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Th-That's nice…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I've thought this for a while, but... You're a bit eccentric, Eve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What do you like to do on days like today? Go shopping? Go on a walk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh…Umm… I usually don't do anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Really…? Then why don't you come train with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Train?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yeah! You shouldn't waste such a nice day staying indoors by yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Besides, I think it'd be super fun to train with you! It'll be like a having a little sister to play with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>A little sister…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(She thinks of me as a little sister.)</td>

<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(…Who knows, but at least she's trying to be nice…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(I can't refuse… I wouldn't want to hurt her feelings…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Moa, are you okay? Hey, hey! Let's get going! What's that saying-- "Sound mind in sound body," right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huh? But I didn't say I would... H-Hang on!</td>
