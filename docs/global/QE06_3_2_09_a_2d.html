<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>I see. So when the bucket was raised from that well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>I'm afraid so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>How fare the citizens?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>They remain troubled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>It's no wonder. Confirming the relationship I had with those two came as quite a shock to many. Time cannot erode such disillusionment so quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>But I must go on. Whatever shame I must bear, whatever struggles I must endure...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Until I've avenged my dear children, I will not go gentle into that good night. I promise you that much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>And the stone and blade you brought me were found in their hands, you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Did Kaede's horn fulfill its purpose as an eye and turn to stone, perhaps? Or could it be it was somehow forced to take on such a form?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>In any event, that it changed forms at all is a clear sign of Mikaboshi's resolve. She's ensured that it will never stop beholding. I just wish she didn't have to go that far...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>The same is true of Sumeragi. I know...just how much of themselves they've disseminated into these artifacts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>At the very least, I can temper both the eye and the blade with my Kagutsuchi, to unite my resolve with theirs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>But...is that all I can do? Isn't there anything more?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>Could I not also be of service?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>Particularly once they've been imbued with your Kagutsuchi, I think it would be fair to call the stone and the blade what they are: Sacred Treasures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>But merely calling them that is not enough. We will need individuals who are capable of maintaining and correctly utilizing them—particularly the blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>Without someone to wield it, it's little more than a decoration. And I think you'll agree, such a status would clearly go against Master Sumeragi's wishes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>What do you propose, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>I know of a person entrusted with the teaching of martial disciplines. In their hands, proper techniques for the handling of this blade could be devised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>It would become a potent assassin's blade, capable of vanquishing any foe, no matter the odds—a most appropriate use for it, I believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>And with each kill, it would slake its thirst, bit by bit, on demon blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Pardon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>As I myself have the blood of demons running through my veins, I can instantly tell. The more demonic blood this blade drinks, the stronger it will become.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>My family line is tainted by it. The sealing of the Demon Paragon spread the curse to us, yet also allows us to imbibe demon blood as emergency sustenance. We are well-suited to handle the blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>I see. So in a sense, it resonates with you. Very well, then. Please proceed at your discretion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha, you may have lost the people's faith, but I do not believe your actions were misguided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>Please know there are many others here as well who share that sentiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>We have affirmed our commitment to you. You are not alone in your struggles. I hope you will never forget that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>We share your will and your desire for the future, and hope that together, we can see through the present turmoil to a better tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>A better tomorrow, huh? The future that Koga envisioned, and Kaede's resolve to support it... Those are the ideals I've been charged with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>I tried so hard, yet in the end, I could do nothing but sit by as you were slain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>How could you two die before your mother?! Have some respect for your family...stupid jerks...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>I'm the stupidest jerk of them all, though. That should've been my body down that well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>But I can't just give up the ghost so easily!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Wait for me, you two. I'll join you sooner or later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>And when I do, you can harangue me all you want. Just... Just please... I know it won't be easy, but I hope in my heart of hearts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>...that you can at least rest in peace for a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Ohh... Mikaboshi... Sumeragi...</td>
</tr>

<td>From that day onward, Queen Mitsuha set the flames of her Phoenix upon the stone and blade alike, time and again, intermixing her own will and determination with that of her children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>And in doing so, the Sacred Three of Wadatsumi were at last complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>As the march of time wore on, I continued to watch the history of this land unfold before me, incorporeal eyes unclouded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Once, I dwelled within the body of a mother. Another time, I was nearly destroyed by the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Still another time, I observed in sadness as the land was laid to waste by the Lion Monarch's Charge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>I can recall nearly being misused at the hands of Wadatsumi's Shiba Senko clan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>There was also a period when I wondered if perhaps someone tainted with malice was heightening the emotions of those who bore the stone, since that seemed to keep happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>For a while, these extreme emotional effects kept getting blamed on the stone-bearer's poor diet, if you can believe it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>I beheld every twist and turn of history. I sought out those who could stand against Malice, so that my resolve might resonate with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>And then, finally, after touching so many lives and observing so much...I met you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>So you truly are...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>While beholding the world as a stone, fate would have it that I'd end up in that well time and again. This last time, part of my consciousness split off from me and was beginning to dissolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>My resolution to see the future my parents dreamed of come to pass was separated from the "me" inside the stone, and I just sat at the bottom of that well, waiting...for so, so long...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>I was hoping someone would come along who could bind my resolve back into me and make me whole again. And like a miracle, here you are!</td>
</tr>

<td>Why would you place your trust in me, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
