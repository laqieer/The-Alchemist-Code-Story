<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Agh...?!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Edgar!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ack. I-it's all according to plan. I can finally see you up close, little lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>All this time...were you trying to get close to her?!</td>

<td>010</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>

<td>In close combat, a sword is much more advantageous over a gun. What are you going to do now that you can't rely on your bullets?</td>

<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I won't! Why are you fighting against each other?! Is it because the justice you seek is different?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Why can't you try to combine your visions of justice?!</td>

<td>As long as you don't give up, I'm certain that you can work together hand-in-hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Maybe you could even change this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Fine then. I've fulfilled most of what I set out to. I'll retreat now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Naive ideals will never change the world. Remember that.</td>
