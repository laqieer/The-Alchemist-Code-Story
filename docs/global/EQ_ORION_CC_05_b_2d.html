<td>001</td>
<td>Ngh... Hurgh! Ghah... Looks like Mammon...won't protect me after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You won't be going on any of those globe-trotting journeys you've so longed for...and I won't be taking the world for my own. Fate is not...on either of our sides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So... What are you waiting for? Aren't you going to finish me off?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Maybe...you reminded me of a little brother I couldn't save.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...! The necklace I bought! I thought you got rid of it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It seems a belled collar suits me more than you after all, little kitten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No. You're the Thunder Wolf. I truly believed that with your strength, Mammon would accept you. It was never supposed to be like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Langhao... I hope you hate me for not being able to save you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't. And you can still save me. If you see me as a wolf, then you must become a lion and take your prize. Finish me off. Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Prove to all those who called you a kitten that you are a lion at heart, and you stand to eat the world. Show them what you're made of! It would be the ultimate justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yes. That's good. A lion doesn't talk back; he just consumes. And should you ever mourn my death...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Just know that you are the king of the lions, and you hold within you the power to destroy this world that killed me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I will. I'll tear it all down. The people... The lands... The Sacred Stones... Even the gods themselves. I will consume it all until nothing remains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Be sure you don't look back when you do. You're a...rebel king now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Strong, to the very end...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And that's how I consumed the Thunder Wolf, and took the throne for myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Some were displeased with the way things turned out, but this is a land where might makes right, and no one could deny my might. So in the end...I was accepted, without much contest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Now the next in line for the throne, I didn't give in, even in the face of Mammon's unfathomable power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Perhaps tired of waiting for me, the Sacred Stone Mammon even incorporated itself into my own flesh and blood, as if bowing in reverence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Bound to Mammon both metaphorically and literally, and granted all the powers that come with such an arrangement—along with the seat of the empire—I was given a new title:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The Lion Monarch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I had taken the position of successor, taken the throne, and next on the agenda was the continent itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>All for the sake of consuming everything in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I fought so hard to become strong, only to learn I was being manipulated all along...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I was just barely accepted by Mammon, but I couldn't keep it under control. I couldn't keep it...satisfied.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I will conquer it all. Nations. People. And...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The Sacred Stones, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I will do what you could not. I will reach the heights you could never quite attain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>And if I can't... If I'm consumed, instead...all the better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You, too, are my flesh and blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>So just keep on watching. There's a lot left to see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Preparations for our march are complete. Oh... Having a rare think, are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I was just reminiscing about the past, hard as it may be to believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Feeling a bit wistful, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It would be hard not to. We are about to rend the equilibrium of the world asunder, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>No worries. Worse comes to worst, we make use of the sleeping Sacred Stone Mammon inside of you. We have nothing to fear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The curse of this land, and the Sacred Stones... I'll overturn it all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Once this attack is underway, I will consume the world. I hope to meet some powerful foes along the way, though, to get my blood boiling once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(Even if I do, however, I'm sure none of them will understand.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(Up until now, all I've done is lose everything that's dear to me... But now, it will all serve to feed me!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Now, let us begin our march. Our target is Envylia, and Lustburg beyond!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The powerful rule this world, and we will show them Greed Dike's true power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Proud soldiers of Greed Dike, fight and claim victory! Nothing can stand in our way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Now, hunt your prey like the proud lion! Tear across the heavens like thunder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>March for your Lion Monarch!</td>
</tr>
