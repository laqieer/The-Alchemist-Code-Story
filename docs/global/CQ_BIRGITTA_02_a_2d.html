<td>001</td>
<td>We've driven them away for now, but I suspect they'll be back. What do you intend to do, Mirianne?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hmm... Do any of you have an idea what might be attracting all these beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The new merchant who took over the mine started using some elaborate and destructive mining methods. I believe the beasts began growing in number around that time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Sounds like the beasts came this way after being driven out of their habitat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That sounds horrible! Did any of you confront that merchant to try and get them to stop what they were doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Of course we did, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This is one of the most profitable gem mines on the continent. I can see why they wouldn't want to let it go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's exactly as you say. They haven't responded to any of our pleas. All we can do now is build fences to ward off the beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Unfortunately, we haven't been able to build a proper fence because of how frequent these attacks are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If you, Madam Soothsayer, could ward off the beasts for us while we build a reliable fence...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This explains why you were so happy to have me here. Shouldn't be a problem. I can take care of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Even without the beast problem, it would be a good idea for the village to have reliable protection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Would you like me to help? I'm quite capable as well, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, absolutely! You clearly demonstrated that fact in the last fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>With you two standing guard, we'll have nothing to worry about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Sure, sure. That's enough about the fence for now. Can you tell us more about this merchant?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Really? Why are you so interested in that point?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Because it's the root cause. Now that we know that, and we've got a plan, all that's left is to put it into motion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Sure, whatever. That's outside my jurisdiction, so I'll leave it to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Mirianne just doesn't get it. Nothing good can come from getting involved in other people's problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If you help one person, somebody else suffers. There's no way to make everybody happy. What's the point of trying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>She's just going to end up getting herself hurt. Maybe I should stop her... No, then I'd be the one getting too involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh, hey! You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hmph. Kids these days have no respect... What is it, child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Are you done talking with the adults? Let's go play!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well, aren't you an energetic one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't you know it's dangerous to talk to strangers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What if I was an evil witch who had snuck into your village to steal you away and eat the two of you up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hahahahaha! You're weird! An evil witch wouldn't tell us she's an evil witch, dummy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Urk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yeah! Besides, aren't you helping the adults with stuff? You can't be a bad witch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hmph... Hahaha! I see you're both too smart for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So, are we gonna play or what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Sure, but...I'm not all that well-acquainted with children's games. What shall we play? Tag?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We can't. Mom won't let us. She'll get mad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Why would she be angry at you for that? Don't kids play tag? It's good for kids to get out and run around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But Mom says we need to stay inside and play quietly because there are beasts outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ahh...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm so bored of playing inside! I wanna go outside and play tag or hide-and-go-seek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You're gonna help build the fences, right? You're gonna fight off the beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We can play outside once that's done, right? Once the baddies are gone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Baddies... Have either of you wondered why those beasts are here in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Beasts don't enter areas where people live for no reason. You need to consider these kinds of things if you want to solve the real problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I don't get it, but Mom and Dad said beasts are bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>And they told us we can't play outside until they're gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Well, they're simply worried about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It's scary to not know when the beasts might come attacking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I understand how that must feel. Once the fence is complete, they won't be able to get in, so don't you worry. Now, both of you should hurry home before it gets dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Aw, man... Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Fighting off baddies, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yet it is sad that they can't play safely outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Heheh. Were you entertaining the kids?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Something like that. Are you finished with your conversation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yep. I got what I needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>As a gem merchant yourself, I suppose this kind of destructive mining is something you can't stand by and allow to continue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I have heard of merchants ruining a mine by going too far. Nature is a difficult thing to tangle with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Actually, I believe it's good to go as far as one can for the sake of profit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The more gems they mine, the more high quality gems we get to see on the market. But still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What is it? It's not like you to hold things back like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>This isn't just about profit anymore. Their to-hell-with-everything attitude is something that I simply cannot condone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I have no interest in business myself, so I'll stay out of this. I'll see you tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>There's something I want to ask you, though. Is this a regular thing for you? Getting involved with other people's problems?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>No... I don't always do this, but I like to help where I can, as much as I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>As much as you can...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>There's nothing strange about wanting to help someone in trouble, is there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>No, of course not. I just don't think it's such a good idea to get so involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Are you worried for me? How sweet of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Sw—?! I-I'm just speaking from experience and trying to give you some good advice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I still will not change my ways. Noblesse Oblige; that's my motto.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Noble...what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>To put it simply...with great power, comes great responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>So you're saying that if you don't do this, your Nob—Noble—nngh... Your motto becomes nothing more than empty words?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Yes, exactly!</td>
</tr>
