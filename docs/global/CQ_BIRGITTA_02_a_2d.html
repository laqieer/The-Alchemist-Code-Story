<td>The new merchant who took over the mine started using some elaborate and destructive mining methods. I believe the beasts began growing in number around that time.</td>

<td>Of course we did, but...</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Villager</td>
<td>It's exactly as you say. They haven't responded to any of our pleas. All we can do now is build fences to ward off the beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Villager</td>
<td>Unfortunately, we haven't been able to build a proper fence because of how frequent these attacks are.</td>

<td>If you, Madam Soothsayer, could ward off the beasts for us while we build a reliable fence...</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/birg.png" alt="Birgitta" height="128"><br>Birgitta</td>

</tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>We can play outside once that's done, right? Once the baddies are gone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/birg.png" alt="Birgitta" height="128"><br>Birgitta</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kid B</td>
<td>I don't get it, but Mom and Dad said beasts are bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kid B</td>
<td>And they told us we can't play outside until they're gone.</td>
