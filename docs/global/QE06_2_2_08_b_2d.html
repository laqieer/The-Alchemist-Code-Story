<td>AAAAND...it's done!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>…………</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Try it! ...Huh? What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's just...I hope what I said didn't set us astray…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We'll figure it out as we go! Don't think too much. Food is either good or bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Besides…we already know we’re in for a difficult climb. After all, we're trying to use food to bring about peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>All you have to do is try it and tell me what you think. That's all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…You're right. Okay. I give thanks for this food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…What do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...Oh! Wow…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Is it delicious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's different than before... Yeah, not bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Not bad? Damn it! Not "delicious?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Er, well it's definitely the best I've had so far...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's not the response I was hoping for! I want to hear you say that magical word!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…Er, well…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But hey! That was our first attempt! We're getting close--I can feel it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Right...and compared to before, my stomach feels much more satisfied.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hot diggety dog!! We must be on the right track!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Just a little more... You're definitely gonna say that it's delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>*Chuckle* You're such a dummy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You already knew that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yep, sure did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Still...I wonder if what we're doing is even possible--putting chakra directly into food and converting it into life force--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We just did, didn't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh, what I mean is... Yes we did, but how on earth--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's simple! All you need is the power of positive thinking: "Be delicious. Be delicious."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…That's it!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Of course, that's not all there is to it. But it's important nonetheless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>… Kinda like giving thanks to the food and the chef?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Bingo! You're starting to catch on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>…There's still so much to learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You'll get there soon enough... I can tell you think of your big brother often.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…My brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You said you wanted to change for your big brother, right--So that you don't burden him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You have a good heart, Kaede. That's why…I know you'll be alright.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Do you...really think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I do! Without those horns, you could easily pass for a human!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>My horns!? They're a part of who I am! I'd never want to lose them…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm not saying you should get rid of them. I just meant--human or demon--who cares about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>As long as we can laugh around the dinner table together, what difference does it make?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You and I can still enjoy a meal together like this--with or without horns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I think that's what will lead to peace in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>…I hope so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>…! Kaede, I need you to hide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's alright. Hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Who's there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It's me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>…What do you want now? No matter how many times you ask, I won't join the Phoenix Brigade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I just dropped by to say hello. I'm not here to try to recruit you. There's something I need to confirm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>…What might that be?</td>
