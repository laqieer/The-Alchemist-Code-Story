<td>- Goetia, Greed Dike Base -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Following their failure to wrest information from the Greed Dike noble Zheng Yi, Nesha returns to base with a dejected Red in tow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>*sigh*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well! That didn't go very well now, did it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>To put it gently, the Director was...not pleased with the results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Not that we had intended to kill the lord and his lady, but walking away with nary a prize was...not ideal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Whatever for? It just means you need more practice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Now, I've already sent in a request for further training, so all you have to do is wait patiently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You can do that, can't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wonderful. Run along now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>They'll be here any minute to take you back to the main base.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, and don't forget: failure is not an option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>My lady, the documents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Thank you. And my recommendation for Red to be posted under Eliza?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The Director will take it into consideration at the next meeting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Splendid. All that remains is the financial report from her, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The sub base at Lost Blue... Come to think of it, it's been a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(Red will probably do a little better working under Eliza, given her...origin.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, no time like the present. We leave tonight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes, my lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>- Goetia, Lost Blue Sub Base -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Strange. It's a lot emptier than I remembered.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Your quarters, my lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I regret to inform you that our Queen has other matters to attend to at the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I am told she will be occupied for several days. Until then, please feel free to take your ease, my lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Tch. You could have told me before I arrived...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ah, well. I suppose I could lounge around—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(Hmm. No. It's beach season, is it not?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(If memory serves, our private beach is not far from this sub base.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(Then this would be the perfect time to flaunt my new swimsuit...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(Yes... The specially tailored one, with the—)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>M-my lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I will absolutely take my ease, thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oh, and I shan't be needing my quarters until the Queen gets back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'll be at the private beach if she returns earlier than expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Do inform her, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>My lady, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh...oh dear. She's headed to the private beach?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But... That other one...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Didn't that one leave for the beach not long ago, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Someone, anyone! Inform the Queen IMMEDIATELY! This is an emergency!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Her- Her property is at stake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What a perfect summer sky...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I do believe it's past time for something more...ah, appropriate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Mmh~! The texture is exquisite! What fine handiwork!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Why, I feel as if I could just float away on that endless azure...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Begging your pardon, my lady, but I think I heard—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Aiiiiieeee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Who dares—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Okay, so I might have hit it a bit too hard... I think it's somewhere over—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Guh! It's YOU!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Why are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I believe that's my question to ask...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I'm shocked a boorish beast like you could enjoy the subtle pleasure of sand beneath your grimy claws.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The heck are you on about? You came here just to pick a fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Fufu... And what's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Nesha turns the volleyball around, revealing a crude—and unflattering—sketch of Eliza's face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>High treason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Tch! It's not like you enjoy being bossed around by that pipsqueak, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I bet you'd be happy to see her taken down a peg or ten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Wait. Maybe you don't, because you're already used to being ordered around by a brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What was his name again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You will NOT speak of him that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>But I'm not about to let you ruin my perfect holiday mood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Fisticuffs are far too plebeian for this beautiful summer paradise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Nesha throws the volleyball back to Lilith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Best of three matches, and the victor gets to stay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I hope you're ready to prostrate yourself before me AND the Queen when she finds out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Try saying that again when you're peeling your pretty face off the sand, sister.</td>
</tr>
