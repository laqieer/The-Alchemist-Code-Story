<td>The guildmaster ran off. He's a fast one...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Curses. I thought I could use him as an informant if he was connected to my brother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hey, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're the guy from before! What a coincidence, seeing you here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>A coincidence, huh? This isn't a place that sees a lot of traffic. I feel it is unlikely this is mere chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh? I guess you're right. It's just that it's so nice out today, I thought that I'd take a little walk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I would appreciate it if you could drop the fake act. It's not even convincing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Wha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I can sniff out assassins, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I don't plan on just allowing you to kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You've gotta really good nose on you, but you're mistaken on one thing. I have no intention of killing you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>And why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, I haven't accepted any contract to do so. I'm not about to go out of my way to take on someone else's extra work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The dirty little assassin has a sense of honor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I don't know if you'd call it honor. I just do what I need to do. I don't bother with anything other than my own missions. That's the way I've decided to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I do what I need to, and that's all. If I don't have to, I don't bother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(Why did I think about Master Ryle just now?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That which allows you to stand a head above others is not your fortune, but your commitment to the precepts of nobility and dignity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Dignity before fortune... What in the world was he talking about...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well... That's something I don't know. I just do my own work, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Persistent, aren't you? I didn't think you'd come back for more so quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You might've beaten me last time, but don't think I'll lose this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Your guild takes on assassination contracts as well, does it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If one can pay the right price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Plus, if I take care of you now, it would make many things a lot more convenient for me. That's right... You Desert Wings are our competition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I see... So that's what this is about. Tch. I guess I shouldn't have expected much from trash like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You, over there. What are you planning to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I already told you. I'll do my job, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What are you doing?! Ugh. It don't matter to me. I'll get rid of both of you!</td>
