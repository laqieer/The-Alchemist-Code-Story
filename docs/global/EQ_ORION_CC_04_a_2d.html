<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This is unusual. I don't typically see you outside the castle at this time of day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Likewise. Come to pay your respects?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It seems only fair I do. I wanted to congratulate you on being chosen. It pains me to admit it, but I wasn't able to keep up with you after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's a rather hackneyed line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, it was a hard-fought victory. You made your dream a reality with your own two hands. Hackneyed or no, formal congratulations seemed in order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I've done nothing worthy of congratulating. If that's all you came here to say, you might as well just leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What's got you in such a huff?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Then why not change it all? Now that you're the next in line for the throne, you should have all the power you need to change anything you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Some things can't be changed with power and influence alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Like what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In this world, the privileged rule, while those who have nothing are simply used. And I've come to realize first-hand just how unappealing that whole system is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't follow you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>"You aren't a very suitable choice after all." That's what His Majesty said about me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What? What does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The Sacred Stone Mammon is Greed itself, and thus hungers for a sizable and continuous offering from the one to whom it is bound...as you yourself well know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But what happens if it has difficulty receiving that offering? What happens if its ability to take that life force is in some way...hindered?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If it's not enough, you mean? In that case...I imagine it would begin to take more and more, eventually exhausting your life force entirely, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And there you have it. Mammon isn't getting what it needs from me, and I cheated my way to the top in the first place. No part of me is prepared for the seat of the empire. I don't even have viable social standing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Nonsense! What of your marriage to Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That was all part of a greater planâ€”a ploy, to take Mammon away from you and see what became of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>And to think, people call me Thunder Wolf. I wasn't changing my destiny for even a moment. I was just dancing like a puppet. Rather pathetic, wouldn't you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I fought so hard to become strong, only to learn I was playing the same games as everyone else all along...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I was just barely accepted by Mammon, but I couldn't keep it under control. I couldn't keep it...satisfied.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You remain Mammon's true chosen. I've shown it the Greed inside me, but I'm a mere stopover along the way. I'm the vacation, but you're the home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It seems all my talk of managing the despair you've had to deal with for so long was little more than bluster on my part. I don't have what it takes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's not like you to give up this easily!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>All of the remaining successors were sacrificed to Mammon, but it still wasn't enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What?! You held such disdain for the fight to become successor, yet you took it upon yourself to end it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's a matter of priority. I gave Mammon their blood in place of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Doing so ensured that it would desire your blood over that of the masses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes... I saw hope in your strength. I felt relief when you took the despair from me. In essence, I allowed it to happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Which makes all of this my fault...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I will walk with Mammon, until the very last of my life force is taken from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Even if I am to suffer eternal torment within Mammon, and become little more than a shell to house that torment...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wait. These aren't assassins. These are... These are...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Imperial Security. They follow only the orders of the emperor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Which makes this different from the assassination attempts upon you thus far. This...is a purge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>No... No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If you die, perhaps Mammon will finally give up on you, and focus all its efforts into giving me its protection instead.</td>
</tr>
