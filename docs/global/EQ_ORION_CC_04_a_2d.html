<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lang.png" alt="Langhao" height="128"><br>Langhao</td>
<td>And there you have it. Mammon isn't getting what it needs from me, and I cheated my way to the top in the first place. No part of me is prepared for the seat of the empire. I don't even have viable social standing.</td>

<tr>
