<td>I'm using my memories to give the illusion a sense of reality. That acts as a kind of anchor to the spell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>Creating illusions like this is part of my magic rites, and requires a lot of auditory and visual experience. That is why I decided to leave my home: to travel and study abroad.</td>

<td>Magic rites might sound scary, but consider this. "Rite" is a homonym of "right", and a rite of passage is something experienced by children and knights alike.</td>
