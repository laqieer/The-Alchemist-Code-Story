<td>Tch...! Kill them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Now hold on just one second...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Kill them! I'd rather die than be eaten by a demon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Leafah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Uwaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Please... May we speak?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes, you may. In fact, please do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Leafah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yeah, that's me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I am not a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Liar! What was that thing you were using to fight with, huh? I've never seen anything like that before! You can't hide the truth from me! You're a demon! A demon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>No. I merely wield the magic rites bestowed upon me as a shrine maiden of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>M-m-ma-ma-magic r-rites?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>There's nothing to be afraid of. See?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ngh... H-huh? I feel...calm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That was a spell to soothe the spirit. I can also create illusions, which I can use to show you the landscapes of Wadatsumi...like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>They're...beautiful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm using my memories to give the illusion a sense of reality. That acts as a kind of anchor to the spell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Creating illusions like this is part of my magic rites, and requires a lot of auditory and visual experience. That is why I decided to leave my home: to travel and study abroad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Y-you're an o-o-occultist! You're trying to spread your horrible curses, the curse of Wadatsumi, across the continent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Magic rites might sound scary, but consider this. "Rite" is a homonym of "right", and a rite of passage is something experienced by children and knights alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I believe that what truly matters is not the form power takes, but the intent of the person who wields it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Are we not examples of this truth ourselves? Look at us. You stay your hand, and I use my talents to show you pretty images.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Nnrgh! I won't be swayed by your illusions, fiend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>How can I make you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Y'know, I did get permission to bring her on the ship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No one told me she would be a demon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You're not even trying to listen, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hah! Why should I let a filthy occultist attempt to deceive me, the future general of this nation?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Leafah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh, well. The coast isn't far now. I guess we can go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The sea's calmed down now. See?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, but... No! Surely you're not suggesting...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Scared, are you? Of a little challenge like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What about our luggage? I don't want to get my kimono wet, either! This is my favorite! My best one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Now it'll be your wettest one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Let go of me! I'm sure we can talk this out with her! I just need time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Like I said, some people won't listen no matter what you say to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ikasa, stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You know what they say: two's a company.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Nooooooooooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>A-after them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ikasa! I'm not very good at swim—blbrf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Don't laugh! I mean it! Ngh, my clothes are too heavy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>So take 'em off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I told you, this is my favorite—blblblbl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ahaha! C'mon, grab on to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Blblblblgf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hey, just look at me, okay? Don't worry about anything else. Take my hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>D-don't let go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I won't. I'm not leaving you ever again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Blblblgf! Wh-what was that? I-I couldn't hear you over the sound of me drowning!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I know, I know. Just hold on tight, Button.</td>
