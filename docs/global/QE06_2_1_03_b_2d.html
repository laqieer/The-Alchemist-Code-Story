<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>That's the last of them. What's our status?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Just a few non-fatal injuries. Nothing too serious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>…What was their motive for attacking us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>…It's no use speculating. For now, we need to devise a plan of action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>…I'll continue to monitor the demons' movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...Azami</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...I'm frustrated with my own weakness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If only I had had been stronger… Then Amane wouldn't have been--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Everyone here shares responsibility. You don't have to bear it alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…Maybe. But I--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If you understand, then start honing your skills--to the point where you can protect everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>…I'm heading back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>…Alright.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We need to discover how the demons are able to use those techniques.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power seemed invincible. It didn't matter how much we damaged him--only decapitating him worked…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Besides, how could he multiply?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is it possible that Jubei is somehow involved?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What makes you say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The most serious offense in the corps rule book--killing a fellow member--indirectly benefits the demons since it reduces our numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>In other words, maybe Jubei did what he did because he was aligned with the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>…We can't rule it out…But the connection seems tenuous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What makes you so sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>For one, what would be in it for Jubei? I don't see how he would benefit from aligning with the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Maybe there was something only Jubei knew about--something we're unaware of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Something important enough for him to betray us? Don't you think the price is too steep?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You make it sound like you know everything about him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…As far as I knew, he had no such motives. I have no reason to doubt him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>…Don't let prejudice cloud your judgement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I could say the same to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You're both Black Star Clan members, yet you treat him as an enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Anyone engaged in the murder of corps member is a disgrace to the Black Star Clan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>There. That's your prejudice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>…Of course. I'm aware of that. What we're discussing is hypothetical.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The question remains--who would seek to ally with the demons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The most obvious answer would be…Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>…It's certainly possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>…I pray that's not the case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's common knowledge that they once experimented with phantoms. If that technology was used…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>…Then we have our answer, don't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>…Naturally, I thought of that possibility, too. However, if that's the case, then what should we do about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I still don't see what's in it for Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>…There's a lot we don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I wonder if someone's ill intentions are at play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>…For now, we've got to find out what information we can…huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Seems that way. You may be right about Jubei being involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>…If only we knew where he was, we could get the story straight from the horse's mouth. Guess we better start searching.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>…Ugachi</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>…The blockhead has a point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>No need for name-calling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>…Thank you, Ugachi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Don't assume he's been absolved of his crime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Well then, we should start our investigation in…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Greed Dike…huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Can we count on you, Commander Celis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I was planning a visit anyway to report the latest events… I'll do a little digging while I’m there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Supposing that this is all Greed Dike's doing…I wonder how many people are involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>…I should have a talk with Judius first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Continue monitoring the demons' activities and prepare for an ambush. While you're at it, there's something I want you to find out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I want you to find the whereabouts of the remaining Sacred Three of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
