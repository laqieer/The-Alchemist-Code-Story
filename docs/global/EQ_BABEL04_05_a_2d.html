<td>Yomi! Have you figured out what's really happening here?! It's not Jin who's trying to use you and your powers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's the Shiba Senko!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>They are the ones who are trying to exploit your powers for their own cause! They colluded with the Kagomurasaki so that they could use your Discarnate Power to rebuild Wadatsumi as they see fit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yomi, you shan't heed a word they say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ugh... Aaahh... Old-t-timer?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I came to determine the sincerity of the Shiba Senko and their leader.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I came in peace, and yet they attacked us. Do you know what that means, Yomi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Do any of you know what any of this means?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wh-what are you...talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>All of this is for the offering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yomi, you are too far gone—beyond the point of no return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The corruption and hatred within you have been amplified to their very limits by the Chakra infused into you through the Demon Calming Ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Now, all you need is a little...push.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>A p-push...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You built up a pile of bodies, and now the lamenting souls left behind are steeping this mansion in a miasma of fear and loathing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>All of this is for the offering—as is my own life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hee hee hee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wh-what are you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>D-did he just...martyr himself?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ggh! Hahahahaaa...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I never swore...my allegiance to Yomi! My master...has always been the Discarnate Power—the corrupted...power that lurks within her, which can overwhelm...and conquer this land!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It would be of great satisfaction to me...if this old, rotting life...could be offered as sacrifice for the manifestation of...its power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Aaahh! Aaaaaaaggggggggghhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Now! Take this feeble old man's life!</td>

<td>Aaaaghhh! I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Heh... Hahahahahaha! I must thank you, Jin! The Discarnate Power will finally take form this day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>At last, Wadatsumi will rise again, reborn as the ultimate nation! We will avenge the disgrace we tasted all those years ago!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power will charge rampant throughout the world! Wadatsumi will rule over its ruin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Now, Mikaboshi, stone of demonic powers, lend us your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Jin...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yomi! Your father, your family—Jin killed them all! My death, and all of the Shiba Senko's casualties are his doing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>N-no! You're...lying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Let the chagrined rage of the dead flow through you! Remember the hatred that once corrupted all of Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Argh! Aaaaagggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi is...!</td>

<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yomi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Yomi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Leafah! Jin! No! I-I don't... I don't want to...! I finally got to—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Unngh... Grraaaaaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Yomi...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Urgh...! Wh-what is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Ngh! Wh-why?! H-how...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Rraaaaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi was swallowed whole?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Those of you that can still move, take the wounded and get out of here! Get as far away as you can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>B-but what about you, General?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I will stay here. I must see this fight through to the end, for the future of this country! Now, go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You should leave, too. You don't want to get dragged into this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I can't do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Grrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Ngh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>This power...! At this rate, Yomi will—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Huaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Argh! I guess it won't work unless it's Sumeragi... Ngh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>WRAAAAAAAAAGH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Argh! Ngh... Yomi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ghurgh! Leafah! Leave now! This is a matter to be solved between siblings!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I told you...I can't...do that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Huuuaaaaahhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Jin! What'd we say about protecting ourselves?! Do I have to do everything around here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Nnnnnngggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Ren!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Am I fashionably late?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>You found Sumeragi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Impressed? You just about ready to welcome my meddling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You keep saying you'll let me help you out, but you just keep picking up the pieces yourself. You're trying to carry too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>If your hands are too full, you can't take the one I'm holding out to you, and I can't trust you to watch my back, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Is there any way out of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Not anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>You saying I'm holding you back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I'm sorry to be selfish like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>You're trying to get killed by your sister, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>You're the best kind of outrageous! I love it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>So are you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>As I suspected, that's what you intend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Was it written on my face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>This is unacceptable. I can't have the brother of my new friend dying on my watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Will you lend me a hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>All right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I'm trusting you to watch my back, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Nngggghhhh! Graaaaaaarrrgggghhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I guess this is all Sumeragi can do in its incomplete state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>In order to breathe life back into Sumeragi, we need to—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>I know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I don't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Two different powers were forged from the demon's horns. One was the Mikaboshi, the cradle of demonic power. The other was Sumeragi, the black blade that can exorcise demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>We can breathe life back into Sumeragi by using the blood of someone related to the head of the Black Star Clan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>This sword is our only hope. If we don't get its true power to manifest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Sumeragi was made to counter the Mikaboshi in the event of its misuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Since we don't have a royal family anymore, the Kagomurasaki Clan has been in charge of its protection until now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>But if its corruption spreads throughout the world, an even greater exorcising power will be needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>We of the Black Star Clan have prepared for that day by devising a technique to power up Sumeragi using our own blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>To unlock the demon's power without it backfiring—that's the super important role I was given by my clan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Ren! Why would you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Following rules and traditions can be interesting sometimes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I'm actually kinda having fun right now! Yep. Bleeding is super fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>All right! It's time for my demon exercise!</td>
