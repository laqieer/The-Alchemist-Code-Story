<td>I've always been told that I'm very perceptive. I was good at reading people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I thought it was because I had received my mother's gift for fortune-telling. She braved the aristocracy and their raging appetites to read the fortunes of nobles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yet before long I realized the truth about my power. I saw things even when I wasn't looking for them. I was no seer, but I had the power of sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Aisha, sweetie. Give me your hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What is it, momma? Is this...a dice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes, Aisha. It's a die. Now, squeeze it tight. Just like that. What you've got in your hand now, sweetie, is a dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>A dream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The pips on a die—those little black dots, you see?—mark one's future choices. The possibilities are infinite. That's why a dream lies in the palm of your hand before the die is cast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So if you ever feel like you've seen too much...or that your dreams are lost, I want you to hold this die in your fist and squeeze it tight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Place your bets, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>All right! I won! Aisha, baby, I swear you're my Lady Luck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Aw, man. I can't believe this. There goes my paycheck for the month.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>C'mon, Aisha, I'm beggin' ya! Let me win the next round!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmm... Nope! Can't do that! It's not up to me. It's just luck; a game of chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Aww...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It'll be all right. You can win it back, I'm sure! After all, the night is young—but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If you were to tell me something I'd really like to hear, something worthwhile, you might find that things just so happen to go your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, nothing! Hee hee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Now, come. For tonight, life is but a dream. So let's make the most of it together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Standing in the center of the frenzy, I watch as hope and fear flicker from one face to the next, and love every second of it. Drawing their gazes thrills me...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(And this place, with all its glitz, makes me feel like I'm in a dream. For all these reasons and more, I love my job. Being a dealer is the best!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Even if the dreams here are not all fun and games.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Never a quiet night in this casino, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Thanks to everyone's support, business is booming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Heheh... I wonder how many of these chumps know who you really are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oops. Did I hit a nerve? Anyway, about the you-know-what...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, well. You found all this out? 'Spose I shouldn't be surprised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm merely doing what I'm paid to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'll be back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Mmm... I'm so tired!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I never see anything good in anyone who comes here to buy information on the sly for their dirty purposes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Everything I see through them is dark...murky. It makes me sick to my stomach. Ugh, I could puke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>At least the people who come to the casino are up-front about their vices. I'd take them over those vile nobles any day of the week.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You're Aisha? Hmph. Not bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I cannot seem to get ahold of your mother, so I suppose you'll have to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Now, tell me what you see. What lies in store for me in the future?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I suppose I must be leading a sublime life without a care in the world, with all the money and women I could ever want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hah! I'm not sure why I even bothered to ask. Now...why don't you come and sit a little closer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You understand, don't you? If you want to continue your career as a fortune-teller, you'll make me feel good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(I thought I had to follow in my mother's footsteps...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(But I couldn't stand it. It made me sick. With the die clutched tightly in my fist, I plunged ever forward...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(But there are no dreams here for me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>C'mon... Give me something good...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Three pips total. That means...change is necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Haa... Time to call it a day, I guess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Are you Aisha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Um... Are you a customer, sir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but we're closed for today. We'll open again tomorrow night, if you're interested in playing with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ohh, you don't say? That's not why I'm here, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'm here to pick up requests from the Great Phantom Thief himself, Chat Noir. Hasn't that eccentric engineer told you about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oh... Well, in that case, how can I help you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Floor plans of the Paolino Residence, a mold for the key to the safe, the serial number of the Guard Droids on patrol...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Mhm. This is all I have on that right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Good, good. This is more than enough for me to get the job done right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You're really intending to rob them? Their security is pretty tight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Which means that they must have something worth guarding! Oohh, I'm so excited, I can hardly wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>(Excited? He's talking about committing a crime.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(I suppose Mister Paolino isn't a good man. That's what the rumors say...and I know them to be true.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>If he has something worth my while, I'll be another step closer to the truth! Ahh... Even just imaging it is just too much! I feel like dancing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>(The Great Phantom Thief, huh? Looks to me like he's just a common criminal planning his next heist.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>(Still, his eyes are shining with excitement. He really is enjoying himself. He almost looks like he's in a dream...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Tell me something. Why are you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Shh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Oi, Aisha! Think ya can fool me? I know when I'm bein' duped! Gimme back my money!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>What's his problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>This just happens sometimes. Some people get like this when they lose big at the casino and try to drink away their sorrows in the aftermath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Who's this you've got with ya? You seein' this guy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Here I am, doing my darndest to get your attention, and ya won't even look at me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Excuse me? I only met this man five minutes ago!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Heh. I only need one to steal your heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Cut that out! I have no interest in criminals, I'll have you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Aww... I'm crushed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Hey! Don't ignore me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You'll regret this! Ya hear me? I'll make sure of it!</td>
</tr>
