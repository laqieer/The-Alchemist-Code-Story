<td>002</td>
<td>Zeke is planning on executing his long-hidden, secret plan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>His long-hidden...? I thought my father had a change of heart after his encounter with the Lizard Brigade?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's how he wants it to appear. Zeke's plan can be traced back to 20 years ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It was set in motion during the Dawn of Wrath when Wratharis was destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Twenty years ago? That's impossible. Stop spewing nonsense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I told you that I had undeniable evidence. That evidence is Agatha, the girl you call your sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Her existence stands as proof of his plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Agatha...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Are you talking about how he found her on the battlefield? I already know that—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>To be accurate, he found her inside the royal castle of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The royal castle? What do you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It appears he hasn't told you the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That girl is the legitimate heir to the royal family of Wratharis. She is none other than the princess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Agatha is the Princess of Wratharis?! How is that possible?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Moreover, the girl has an even larger, hidden secret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wh-what is it?! Tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Agatha works part time at a fancy cafe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>There's more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>She goes barbecuing with friends on weekends, hangs out at nighttime pool parties, and even attends foam parties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wha— Agatha is becoming a party girl?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>She is also secretly performing as an idol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No! This is exactly what father wanted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It all started when Zeke sent an application form in to an agency.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>He had raised her specifically for this purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>He loves idols so much...that he raised one himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Zeke... I must end your rampage with my sword of justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I asked what have you done, Dias. Answer...me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I said answer me, Dias! Answer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I killed him... I killed the man I once admired as...my father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It was all to protect Agatha! If you share his beliefs, then I'll have no mercy on you as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I don't need your mercy! I'm going to shatter that notion out of your mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>How did it come to this? Why must I be called Headstrong Dias?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What would Yuffie think? I'm sure she would worry... Tch! Where did I go wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I...! I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>April Fools... Never did I expect that I would meet you on this day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Don't you know what this day is about, Dias?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You again?! Just who the hell are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh, how this game never changes. Did you forget who I am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm the TAC Producer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>All of your recent actions are the result of having consumed that Alchemy Mushroom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>They draw out the innermost desires of people in the most twisted and excessive manner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You're telling me everything is your doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That's right! You have a problem with that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I cannot let this sin go unpunished.</td>
