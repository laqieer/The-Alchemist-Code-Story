</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gluttony Military Official</td>
<td>We believe that he has made contact with the dissident nobles.</td>

<td>What a fool. Had he stayed by my side, I would have let him be a fine ornament on the throne.</td>

<td>Ah! There's that hate, that obsession! Oh, Collectors of Wisdom, you are proving to be well worth my recruitment of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>Yes, but I'm from one of the bloodlines that escaped to Gluttony Foss after the great tree burned down, so I have very little knowledge of the tribe.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>It wasn't just us. A lot of people came together to achieve that miracle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/logi.png" alt="Logi" height="128"><br>Logi</td>
<td>I see. So that's why you came here in search of the Sephira, the legendary people of wisdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Yes. To be honest, I had my doubts that we would even find you, but thankfully we made it in time.</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>What?! Are you saying that even the Sephira can't help her?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Curses are essentially a distortion in Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Curses are normally dispelled from the land or people they afflict when that distorted flow of Alchemia is corrected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>However, Mocca's distortion does not originate from within her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Her wounds will not heal unless we exterminate the root of the corruption, the one that created the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Do you mean Beelzebub? But the Sacred Stone has already lost its power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ceclidis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>...</td>

<tr>

<td>He controls these Jam you speak of, but none of us ever knew where they came from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>Could it be that he...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>If so, that would explain how the Gluttony army was so knowledgeable about the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Is that really possible? Can people really control things like the Jam and the curses of the Sacred Stones?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Ceclidis possess a Philosopher's Stone imbued with Sephiron's life force. I'd say that means that he has the power to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Then I must defeat this man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>They are vanguards of the Gluttony army, responsible for abducting descendants of the Sephira and those with high Alchemia aptitudes to be provided to that country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/logi.png" alt="Logi" height="128"><br>Logi</td>
<td>I want to stop them. I can no longer sit by and watch the weak be preyed upon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>There are forces within Gluttony that would also be willing to stand against the king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>With their cooperation, and with the help of the Protector, we just might have a chance.</td>
</tr>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>

</tr>

<td>Then you'll help us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Gluttony Foss is suffering from the chaos of civil war. I understand why you would think that now is the perfect time to undo his evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>However, Ceclidis is the man who singlehandedly destroyed the Sephira village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Now he has authority over the entirety of Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Facing off against an entire country is no simple task.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>That does indeed make us a force to be reckoned with, but it will still not be enough to strike Ceclidis down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/logi.png" alt="Logi" height="128"><br>Logi</td>
<td>Who else would aid us in this effort?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/logi.png" alt="Logi" height="128"><br>Logi</td>
<td>Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>That's right. This power has always been with you in your battles.</td>
</tr>
