<td>Seriolde is gone, isn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We believe that he has made contact with the dissident nobles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What a fool. Had he stayed by my side, I would have let him be a fine ornament on the throne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Gather the troops. Flush him out of wherever he may be hiding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes, my lord!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If you cannot find him...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Then burn them. Burn every house that might give him refuge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wha...? B-but my lord—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Did you not hear me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>U-understood, my lord! I'll do as you command! P-please, don't kill me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Good. Now get out of here. I have things to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Y-yes, my lord!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We have failed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh? That is unexpected. Wait, then that can only mean that—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Finally, the Protector takes action! That nuisance! Hahaha! As he should!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I personally tracked him, and yet he somehow managed to escape my grasp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It is only natural that he would be difficult to eradicate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We reject that man. We do not accept his ramblings. They are not the collective will of all Sephira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ah! There's that hate, that obsession! Oh, Collectors of Wisdom, you are proving to be well worth my recruitment of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Do not underestimate him, however. He sees things from a vantage that we cannot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If you use force alone, you will only lose him in that Truth again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>He, too, has his weaknesses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>He is nothing if not compassionate. He will not be able to turn a blind eye to the grief of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If the people of the desert are forced to endure hardship, he will undoubtedly come running to their aid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Interesting. I will prepare the stage, while you continue to chase him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Understood. Let Sephiron guide us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hahahahaha! Oh, just you wait and see, Kamui! You will soon breathe your last breath!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So, what is this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This is one of our offices. The Fruit Peddlers have several of these throughout the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>There's no need to worry about eavesdroppers here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So you deal with artwork and handicrafts from all sorts of countries?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This is some glasswork from Lustburg! I've always loved little trinkets like these!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(There's no doubt about it. This Alchemia I sense from her is so much like Malta's.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Is...there something on my face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ah, no. I was just feeling nostalgic. You are a Sephira, are you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yes, but I'm from one of the bloodlines that escaped to Gluttony Foss after the great tree burned down, so I have very little knowledge of the tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>How is Mocca doing, anyway? She hasn't yet come to, has she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No need to worry. This place has a special, purifying barrier, which is known amongst the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The corruption's progression will be halted—for now, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That's a relief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You said her name was...Mocca? How did she come to be like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>She was struck by a curse from the Jam that appeared in our home, in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We tried everything we could think of, but we couldn't rid her of the corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Then you were involved with that incident in Saga! Could it be that you two were the ones who subdued that dragon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It wasn't just us. A lot of people came together to achieve that miracle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I see. So that's why you came here in search of the Sephira, the legendary people of wisdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yes. To be honest, I had my doubts that we would even find you, but thankfully we made it in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Unfortunately, I may not be able to cure her here and now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What?! Are you saying that even the Sephira can't help her?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Curses are essentially a distortion in Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Curses are normally dispelled from the land or people they afflict when that distorted flow of Alchemia is corrected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>However, Mocca's distortion does not originate from within her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Her wounds will not heal unless we exterminate the root of the corruption, the one that created the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Do you mean Beelzebub? But the Sacred Stone has already lost its power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ceclidis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>He controls these Jam you speak of, but none of us ever knew where they came from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Could it be that he...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If so, that would explain how the Gluttony army was so knowledgeable about the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Is that really possible? Can people really control things like the Jam and the curses of the Sacred Stones?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Ceclidis possess a Philosopher's Stone imbued with Sephiron's life force. I'd say that means that he has the power to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Then I must defeat this man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>He's the king, the ruler of an entire nation. You'll never be able to reach him alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>That may be true, but I cannot stand idly by and watch my friend suffer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Calm down, Tina. That's not what I meant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I'm asking you to let us, the Blue Tongues, lend you a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Are...you sure about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>The Collectors of Wisdom we fought earlier are most likely connected to Ceclidis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>They are vanguards of the Gluttony army, responsible for abducting descendants of the Sephira and those with high Alchemia aptitudes to be provided to that country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I want to stop them. I can no longer sit by and watch the weak be preyed upon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>There are forces within Gluttony that would also be willing to stand against the king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>With their cooperation, and with the help of the Protector, we just might have a chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Ceclidis is indeed a dangerous man. Unless he is dealt with, there will be more tragedies and the people will continue to suffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Then you'll help us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yes, but now is not the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Gluttony Foss is suffering from the chaos of civil war. I understand why you would think that now is the perfect time to undo his evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>However, Ceclidis is the man who singlehandedly destroyed the Sephira village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Now he has authority over the entirety of Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Facing off against an entire country is no simple task.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>The Blue Tongues, the Shamans of Saga, the rebellious forces of Gluttony, and the Fruit Peddlers—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>That does indeed make us a force to be reckoned with, but it will still not be enough to strike Ceclidis down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Who else would aid us in this effort?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Think carefully, now. What has always fought by your side?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>That's right. This power has always been with you in your battles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>However, you still do not comprehend its true value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>The true value of Alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I could explain it with words, but I doubt that would bring you true understanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>It would be best for you to feel for yourself the power you wield.</td>
</tr>
