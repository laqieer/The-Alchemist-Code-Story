<td>002</td>
<td>Hey, are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Me? I'm...no, I am Arkil, wanderer of the desert people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I went out of my way to rescue you when I found you collapsed on the desert sand. You better be thankful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>R-right... Thank you; you saved me. I am Yomi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I see. You came from the country of Wadatsumi, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>How do you know that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(Seriously. I'm pretty sure anyone can tell just from her outfit.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's because I work as a fortuneteller. Let me see...you treasure that sword very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And you come from a reasonably noble house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(Well, those are all things you can tell just from the look of her, but where is she from?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Also...you have a brother. He is very important to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh? Did I get it wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(I was sure she was murmuring something about that.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'll say that you're half right and half wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see. So it's somewhat complicated then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You see everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Of course. I told you that I'm a fortuneteller.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Lord Arkil! The enemy is attacking! Please, lend us your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh well, fine then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh? So you're not a fortuneteller?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>There's much you must do in order to survive in this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>In that case, I'll lend you my strength. I need to repay you for saving me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Thanks. Well, just don't push yourself too hard.</td>
