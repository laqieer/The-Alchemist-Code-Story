<td>Lisbeth, please take care of the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Got it! Leave it to me! Both of you'd better come home safely. Promise me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>All right. We'll be on our way now, Fuu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Very well. Good luck, Tina, Mocca. Do try and return to us alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...You don't have to tell me twice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>By the way, where's Tamis? I thought she'd come to see you two off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't worry about Tamis. She should be waiting patiently for our return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I see. Well, let's go then, Mocca. To Asena!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hyaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Glurrrrppp...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Mocca! How are things over there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I've pretty much taken them all out. Tina...you're hurt. Hold on a second. Let me take a look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh...this is nothing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Never mind that; let me check... It's not too deep. Let's bandage it with some cloth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hey, wait, this is nothing... Also...you're really close...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What are you talking about? We've still got a long way ahead. We lose nothing by tending to it now. Let me take care of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>All right. Done. How is it now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>U-um...it's okay. It feels better now. So...you don't have to be so close anymore! What about you, Mocca? Is your corruption continuing to spread?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ever since Voda tended to it, it's been doing better. Of course, the root cause hasn't been taken care of, but just the relief from pain is enough for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Right now, we can't afford to be defeated. We are shouldering not only the future of Saga, but Alia's resolve as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Don't forget about Fuu's resolve. I'm sure it's been painful for him to shoulder everything all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I know. It made me realize that the future is built on the resolve of various individuals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Voda also responded swiftly to our resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm not certain what Tehre's resolve is yet, but...I'm sure there is some way we can work together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes! ...What's the matter, Tina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Speaking of Tehre...I wonder what happened to that boy Rega.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Do you think he arrived safely at Port Nahema?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Good question... I wonder how was he able to manage that situation on his own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Once we return to Tehre with the token, let's ask.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes... That being said, it's been a while since the two of us set out alone like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I feel like so much has happened since then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Indeed. That being said, now isn't the time for nostalgia... We need to keep our eyes focused on what lies before us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Glurrrrrppp!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Tsk... We don't have time for this! Mocca! Let's push forward! We're so close to where Asena is!</td>
</tr>
