<td>Hey, Will?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Call me either Mister Will, or Wild Will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>All right. Wild Will it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wait, no, don't call me that. Knowing that I made you say it makes it embarrassing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Those guys who attacked you back there...they were using Alchemy, weren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Do people use Alchemy against each other in this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What's going on with the Alchemy in this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You know, you haven't told me anything yet. This isn't shaping up to be much of a trade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm asking you for an advance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Make favors, never owe them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Whatever... Mom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hey. What the hell is with you, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You appeared out of thin air, you can't touch or be touched...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ew! Did you try and touch me?! You slimeball!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Those strange clothes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Keep your eyes to yourself, you pig!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Are you a ghost? Some kind of supernatural phenomenon? This has gotta be an occult thing, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm a time traveler. I came here from the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What could I say that would make you believe me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's not an easy thing to believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You're telling me! I can hardly believe it myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I can't believe that this is the future we desired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>C'mon, answer me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>My first question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You wanna know for whom Alchemy was created, or something like that, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm currently searching for the answer to that question myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>And I'm not the only one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What do you mean? Are you talking about Albea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm talking about a guy who's a bit of a looker and sports the same hair color.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I guess you could say that means we've all got something in common.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You're a time traveler who came here from the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If you don't know something, you go looking for the answer, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You, y'know...travel.</td>
