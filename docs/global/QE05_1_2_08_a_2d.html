<td>Find the green... That makes sense! Follow the green in the desert to find the water!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Exactly. It is the same in any other kind of harsh terrain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Nature likes to defy human expectations, but it is possible to figure out its patterns. That is how we survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Excuse me, can I steal Kamui for a bit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What is it, Isidore? Did another beast get lost in our fields?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No, it's not really an emergency or anything, but... Whoops. Sorry for interrupting mid-lesson, Hisham.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Nah, it's fine. I was starting to get cross-eyed with all this new information. Time for a break!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Then I have perfect timing! Good job, me. Here, Hisham, here's a present!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ohhh, candy?! Where did you get this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Met up with a supply caravan while doing some patrols outside of the barrier, so I did a bit of trading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Outside the barrier...? The roads that supply caravans use should be quite a ways from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yeah. We got information that the Royal Army has been setting up camp nearby recently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We're still hidden by the mirage barrier, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I see, so that is what you need help with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Will you lend me a hand, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'll even lend you both, since you're a friend. This is for the safety of the village, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Hisham, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's fine, it's fine. Can I borrow some of your books again, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Kamui, look at this! It's a fishing pond! A fishing pond! Living in an oasis is the life... You can use the water for whatever you want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Isidore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wanna try it? I mean, heh, when was the last time either of us went fishing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Isidore, what is this? You said that we were coming out to do some reconnaissance on the Royal Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Shhh, shhh... Take a peek across the oasis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Tents...of the Gluttony army. I see. They've stopped here to replenish supplies and water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If we fish over here, we can see the army on the other side without alerting them to our information-gathering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You couldn't just tell me that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, I mean, I also thought it might be good for you to take a break. Iakov's been pushing you kind of hard recently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It is necessary training for the role of Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ah, yes, the role which was once my father's. I don't know the specifics, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Just looking at your face makes it clear to me that it's an exceptionally difficult training regimen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Remember, friend. I am here to help if you need me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I haven't forgotten. Thank you, Isidore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Heheh... Since this is such a rare opportunity, why don't you call me "big bro" like you used to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What in the world are you on about? We're the same age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Aw, man. Hisham won't call me by a cute nickname either...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Apple doesn't fall far from the tree, eh? He's just like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hey, look at this. No fish are biting at all. Are there even fish in here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Isidore, I was wondering... What do you think of Hisham?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>He seems to enjoy studying. Recently, he spends all day in the house reading books.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Uh... Isn't that a good thing? Maybe we should see if the old wise woman is looking for a successor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I don't know. Maybe. Recently, I feel like he's looking beyond the village for something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>He's been interested in things like how to live in the desert, how to find water, and how to revive land and agriculture in soil that has become barren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ah... Well, his village did have that whole thing with the well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yes. I think he is looking for a way of surviving without needing anything from anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I have this feeling that, one day, that search for a new way to live will lead him out and away from the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Aw. Does that make you feel lonely?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>No, I... Unexpectedly, I feel pleased to see him trying to make his own way. I want to watch over him as he figures it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Heheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What are you laughing at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You sound more like a parent than a big brother to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Mmm... I suppose you are right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Aw, look at you! Talking about the future like this! It's enough to bring a man to tears!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What is with you? What are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>As a kid, you used to just trail after me and Malta like a lost lamb, and now you're fully-grown with a kid of your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Now who sounds like a parent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Hahahaha, you're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If I remember correctly, the two of you were always together because you loved Malta and she couldn't shake you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Oh, yes... Eventually the Chief himself decreed that I would be her fiancé, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Well, well. A certain Chief-to-be wants to chat about the past today, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Actually, you know what happened?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I went to discuss the wedding date with Malta the other day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>According to the wise woman, the night of the new moon in a few weeks would be best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Yes, Sephiron's glow is especially beautiful on new moon nights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Yeah... Thinking about all this has got me thinking about the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Now you just sound like an old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Ha. Recently, though, Malta seems to be restless or sick, or...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I don't know. Maybe she's getting cold feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Cold...feet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You've never heard of it? It's when someone gets nervous before their wedding. What do you think I should do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I haven't a clue. I had no idea about all this. She seems just fine whenever I see her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>W-wait, then is it just me?! Am I the problem here?! Kamui! What do I do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>We've all been friends for so long, you have to have some ideas for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Calm down, Isidore. You're a great guy. Any woman would be lucky to have you as a fiancé.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Really? You think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Come on, be more confident. You are the one the Chief has judged as worthy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I-I guess... Recently, I've been a bit busy and haven't had the chance to talk with her properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I just c-can't help it. I get so anxious thinking about it! Kamui, I need advice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You really lose your head when it comes to Malta, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Surprises me, too. I just can't seem to shake it. Still, I think it's just proof of my feelings for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I suppose...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Nn? Isidore, look. Something's happening over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>It's Ceclidis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>The general of the Royal Army himself? What's he doing here on the front lines...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Something about all this is making me uneasy. Let us return to the village, quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Hey, you there! You were watching our camp, weren't you? Spy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Why, I never! We were just a bit curious since it's unusual to see soldiers around these parts. How rude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>(Kamui, what do we do?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>(We'll have to play dumb. It'd be best if we can get out of here with as little fuss as possible.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Huh? I wasn't talking to you! I was talking to that woman over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>What woman?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I know your face, woman! Teona, gladiator of the rebel army!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Aw, crap. I guess it's impossible for someone like me to lay low.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Teona?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Friend of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>So... If we just abandon her to her fate, you'll probably have trouble sleeping at night, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Most likely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Capture her, but do not kill her! We may still be able to get the new locations of the Liberation Army's bases!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>There's nowhere left to run! I guess I have no choice!</td>
</tr>
