<td>What's on your mind, Seida?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Well... I just think we shouldn't underestimate that Spica girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>She disappeared without a trace in such little time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>She might have possibly received some kind of special training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Tsk, this is so troublesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's Kanon's fault in the first place to be carelessly taking along this completely random character.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>She lacks the required self-awareness of a Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The required self-awareness of a Lord Commander? Captain Monzein, do you understand how much mental energy it takes to be the Lord Commander?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh? Well... I've never been the Lord Commander myself though, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Kanon is just the same. She was assigned as the next Lord Commander so suddenly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's not like the self-awareness as a Lord Commander suddenly appears out of nowhere. So do you think it's reasonable for the captains to expect her to be perfect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>W-well... i-it's not like I expect her to be perfect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Then isn't it perfectly natural that she lacks that self-awareness you're talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But it's still an undisputable fact that Kanon, a young girl with little experience, got assigned as the next Lord Commander!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But even so, all you do is complain! What do you expect will happen if we don't support her?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Geez, how inflexible can you be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>As a former member of your regiment, I would really like you to act like a proper captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh?! What did I do or say that was inflexible?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Aren't you aware of that?! Don't you know what your regiment members are calling you behind your back?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What they're calling me? I know they do call me “The Great Thunder Axe...”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Geez... it's a bit embarrassing, so I always tell them to shut up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No. Behind your back, they go on calling you “the foolish boar.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>T-t-the foolish boar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You've been making a fool of yourself with your stubborn and reckless behavior. It's sad for me to see as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>W-who?! Who are the ones who called me that?! Bring them all here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>How could I possibly even do that? Please stop saying such unreasonable things!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Grrrr! How could they make a fool out of their captain?! It's going to... it's going to disrupt the order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Anyway, it's our duty as captains to give our support to Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Please just engrave that in your mind!<br>Do you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ughh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wow! I wouldn't have imagined such a cave beneath Ramproad Mountain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If we wouldn't have known about that tiny entrance, we would have never noticed! We really need to thank Seida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We've been walking for quite a while though, and we haven't seen any people, let alone a blacksmithing forge. Is this really the right place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Look there! That looks like some kind of monument! The fact that there's something here created by humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...Must mean that the forge could be near!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Right. Let's investigate. We may find a hint that indicates the location of the forge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It doesn't actually look that old...<br>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What's the matter, Chloe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wait a second, Kanon!<br>This monument... it has Yogi Ku's name engraved in it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh?!<br>Could it be... Yogi Ku's grave?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Could it be that the reason why Seida said we may not be able to get Excalibur restored...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...be because Yogi Ku has already passed away?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh... but Yogi Ku is the only person who could possibly restore Excalibur!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Are you serious?!<br>If that's true, Excalibur may never...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I can hear Excalibur calling. It seems that the stories of Zain being killed were true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I never expected a little kid like you showing up with it though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>U-umm... who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Be quiet! You bunch of degraded knights who disgrace the name of the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Let me bestow punishment upon you in Zain's stead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Shining Flare!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>?!<br>D-dodge, Chloe!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Tsk...<br>Pretty swift aren't you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>H-hey, wait a second!<br>How did you just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That ability just now, that was Lord Zain's ability! How could she know it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You're not getting away from here! Feel your regrets as you perish!</td>
