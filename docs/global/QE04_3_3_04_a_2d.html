<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Fuu, I've returned. So far, there has been no damage to the village. However, the Jam's numbers have increased.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Thank you... There is much we must hurry with. And...what of Tamis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I searched for her from the sky, but...I can't seem to find her anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Honestly...where has she gone off to?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Could she have...gone after Tina and Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>When she can't see? Impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But she kept going on about how she wanted to help Mocca...so I thought, just maybe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If something happens to that child, how will I be able to face Alia? Her existence is a necessity to the future of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Mocca is also considerably late. I just hope he returns safely...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Fuu, those two really are important to you, aren't they? Although you do tend to be pretty rough with Mocca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Of course, they're important to me. Those two are the descendants of the Alize people. Protecting them is my way of paying penance to Alia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...I'm going to search for Tamis again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Fuu...I'm sorry for the delay. We've returned now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Tamis! Where have you been?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>My apologies, Fuu...I...I!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You idiot! You had me worried sick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...I'm sorry, Fuu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Were you chasing after Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes...I'm sorry I made you worried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But...if it weren't for you, Tamis, we wouldn't have been able to overcome the trial. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...I'm glad I was able to help a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I finally found a way that I can save Saga and help Mocca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Fuu, please...there is something I wish to search for in the Wind Temple. I am certain that it's in that land which enshrines the wind...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>There should be some kind of hint regarding the people of Sephira that flourished under Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hm? What's got into you all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We don't know the specific mechanics of why the power of purification could suppress Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>By knowing this, we may be able to uncover the secrets surrounding the wind's circulation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>For the sake of restoring the Wind Matter...please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I see. In that case, we'll put together a search party.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>As for now...you've returned home safely, Tamis. You must be tired. Try and get some rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Very well, Fuu. If something happens, please, inform me about it immediately. Excuse me, everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm glad you returned without incident. And did you obtain Asena's Tear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yes. It's here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ah...this is, indeed, one of Asena's Tears!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes...it's the invaluable token we received from Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We will now head to Tehre and have him fulfill his promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Very well. I leave it in your hands. Well done, Mocca. The road ahead will still not be an easy one, but do your best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The future of Saga rests in your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes. I will shoulder your resolve as well, Fuu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I see a gigantic Jam approaching from the south! I think we should defeat it before it approaches the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...Rega?! What are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh, it's the magic lady! Let me touch your wand this time! Well, I'm off then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What is that child doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We'll explain everything carefully later. He...is the third Wind Shaman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
