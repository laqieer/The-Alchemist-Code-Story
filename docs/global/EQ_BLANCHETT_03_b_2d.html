<td>Agh...hahh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>There are still more wolves. Maybe they're near the village? Hah. I'm not gonna let a single one of them survive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Blanchett.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Freed? Are you going to stop me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh, what...? Why...why did you...disappear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh, I'm a Phantom Soldier right now. I made a temporary life made from Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Your strong desire to live is what summoned me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, I also had a bit of a hand in it as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You have the book I gave you, right? Actually, that's signed with my blood. It's enough to trigger my transmutation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh? But that's strange. Only people who've died become Phantom Soldiers, right? Then why you, Freed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I told you before, I'm an academic. If I stood up to a Blue Flame Wolf, of course it would end up like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You went out of your way to be the victim of my blade?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes. Unfortunately, I'm no match for you. That being said, the Blue Flame Wolf isn't soft enough to respond to enemy persuasion...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Captain Zeke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There are no signs of children in the cart. Just soldier equipment...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So I was set up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We've both suffered the consequences. That being said, I'm going first. There's a child I've kept waiting...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is this Alchemy...? But, what is going on...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That Blue Flame...Wolf...Blood Wolf! I won't forgive him! I won't! I'll avenge you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You don't need to do that, Blanchett. In my case, it was pretty much self-inflicted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You don't have to carry that burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No. No! Are you going to leave me behind again?! Everyone always does. Why...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Blanchett. I've made you remember sad things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But that's just a memory. For my part, I'm nothing more than one person who you happened to cross paths with in this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No! No...after all, you taught me how to cut pictures...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I thought revenge was the only thing I had left, but you told me that wasn't true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>When I was lonely, you stayed by my side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm thankful to you. All this time, I never really felt alive. I was like a balloon floating aimlessly in the air, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The moment that I decided to protect you, I truly felt like I was alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You saved me from that never-ending struggle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I don't know what you're talking about! Explain it in a way so that I can understand! You're smart, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I think I'm not as good at self-analysis as I thought I was. I'm not sure how to describe this feeling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>But, right now, you are crying for me, Blanchett. You saved me because you are that kind of person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's why, yes, it's selfish, but I want to see you off with a smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>There's no way I can do that...I really want to cry right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I see. I see. Oh, one last thing for your studies...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No way... Freed? Freed?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That is the extent of my memories of the night that I spent with Freed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I have a purpose for living. There are people that I want to take revenge on while I'm alive, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Even now, sometimes I dream about that night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Heh. This is a masterpiece! I call it the Pyramid Animal Orchestra!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wow! That's amazing! I might've seen this shape in a picture book before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Right? I've reproduced it! I'm pretty talented, if I may so myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Your picture cuttings look like magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Oh, nothing. I just remembered, a long time ago, someone I met in an orphanage said the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Oh really? I'm kind of interested in that person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>She's doing fine. After the war ended...a lot of things changed though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Still, as long as you can stay alive, everything kind of works itself out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hmm. Your hometown was Wratharis, wasn't it, Blanc? I wish you would take me on a tour!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Sure thing! My recommendation is the National Library! It's the miraculous building that didn't burn down during the war. Also...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's where the man who saved my life used to work.</td>
