<td>For starters...who exactly is he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You said he was the protector of the clock tower, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes. He's the descendant of the protectors of the clock tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Protectors...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ever since that clock tower was established, it's been managed by a family of watch tower protectors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Until the clock tower was placed under the jurisdiction of the Beckrams, no one from outside that family was ever given the role of managing it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So no one besides this family who protected the clock tower knew of its actual state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>In other words, it was in a complete state of secrecy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Depending on how you look at it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The only person with contact to that family was the head of the Elestersâ€”my father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>With the isolated clock tower under the protection of the Elesters, it was the perfect hiding location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Do you think Belphegor was in the clock tower, after all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>On the surface, they managed the clock tower, yet the family's true role was to hide and protect the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>When you think of it like that, it comes together nicely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm certain that Ethan's family was the protectors of the Sacred Stone Belphegor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The Beckrams must have uncovered the clock tower's secret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Having been cornered by them, Ethan decided to bestow the responsibility to you, little lady. I guess that pretty much sums it up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Bu-but, even if I wanted to protect it, I don't know its location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>In any case, Ethan is the one who holds the key to finding the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We've gotta do whatever we can to rescue him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes! Ethan...please be safe!</td>
