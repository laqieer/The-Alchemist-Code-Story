<td>You've already lost. Surrender.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I...will never succumb to Alchemy! It's power only gives birth to sorrow!</td>

<td>...Captain Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Power must be accompanied by empathy, or else it will never lead to true peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Empathy without power will only lead to death, Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Stop!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We made it in time.</td>

<td>Cadanova! Let me go! I can still fight! I need to stop him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You rest. Leave this to those of us who can wield Alchemy!</td>

<td>Hyahhh!</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Foolish Paladins... Why do you protect the Holy Order of Babel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The Holy Order is a symbol of peace in Babel. It's destruction would throw the world into darkness and confusion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The Holy Order advocates peace, yet behind the scenes they monopolize Alchemy while fortifying their power and status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You Alchemy-wielding Paladins are nothing more than tools to fulfil their corrupt desires. Why can't you realize that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's true that some may be corrupt. However, there are many who truly seek peace as well! What about the young knights that you yourself trained?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>As long as the smallest fragment of evil exists, it will continue to spread throughout the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>In order to destroy the Corpse, the entire Holy Order of Babel must be dismantled!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The Corpse...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Open your eyes! History is simply repeating itself, and they're the ones making the rules!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Then, I'll fix the corrupted Holy Order of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I regret wasting my time trying to convince you. Very well then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>In order to change the world, I will obtain further power! Uck...uckkkkaaaah!</td>

<td>Zahar! Did you just sign a contract with the darkness?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hahaaaah! Heh...heheh... So this is the forbidden power. Not bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Tsk! Thus, the ultimate Black Knight is born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Haaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Heheheheh! Flame Dragon King!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Incredible! Even after Zahar signed a contract with the darkness, Cadanova still manages to hold him off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>At this rate, I won't have enough strength! I need more! Paladins, give me your power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Im-impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ugh! Aghhhhh!</td>
