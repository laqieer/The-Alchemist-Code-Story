<td>Wratharis - Ruins of an Ancient Babel Civilization</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This blood... It looks like there's a trail of it, leading deep into the ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What is going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Your brother's star has sunk to the depths of the river of rage, leaving its light scrambled upon the surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The river of rage? Does that mean...Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Upriver lies the source of the star stream itself. It lies still, with open maw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The source of the...star stream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The ancient capital, tied to the forbidden art.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The forbidden art? Alchemy? The ancient...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Wait! Does this mean that there are ruins in Wratharis like the ones in Slothstein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Eventually, your brother's star will be drawn spiraling into the center and engulfed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Taken to the place of the sealed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My brother is...in here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Tch! Are you still following me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yeah, and I'll be sticking to you like glue for as long as it takes to get you to quit while you're ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This is a very unwelcome favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What are you doing here, anyway? Your brother wouldn't—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The stars guided me here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This isn't the time or place for jokes! Now get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I will not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Albea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If I don't see him now, I'll never get to see him again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Somehow, I... I just know that to be true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Albea, I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Mira?! Where have you been this whole time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What? What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hurry! You've gotta get out of the ruins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I won't let you get in my way, either, Mira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No, no, no! That's not what I'm doing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Nng?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What's that sound?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Something's coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Wait a minute, could this be...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It is! It's those things you were researching in the lab in Slothstein, Will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Grroogh... Rrroooohh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wh-what are they?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Demonic Soldiers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Grrrroooaaaarrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Who would activate them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Demonic Soldiers?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>They're weapons of destruction, much like the Demons I told you about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There still hasn't been a thorough expedition into these ruins in Wratharis or the ones in Slothstein, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It is believed that if the Demons are weapons of mass destruction, then that makes these Demonic Soldiers weapons designed for slaughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(The Alchemia powering them... I feel like I know it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(No, it's more than that... Why is it so familiar?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Raaaaah! Rraaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(This can only mean that their power is comparable to that of the Cursed Beasts!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Run! Get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Run? And go where?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Anywhere! Just wait until this all blows over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I've waited long enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm tired of waiting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Albea?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I've always gotten rid of problems as they come up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Why are you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I think you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You have a little brother, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You said that he's your only family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I do, and I understand—but still!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'm a little hardheaded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You can run if you want to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You know I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You said you're neither friend nor foe to me, right? You said you don't know anything about my brother, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That's what I said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Then you have no reason to stay here and fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I also made a bet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What did you wager?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Life itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>On what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Hmm... Brotherhood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>That's so cheesy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I get that a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Grrrroooaaaarrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>(Such strong convictions.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>(They are so determined to march into the future...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>(Even though they can't see what lies ahead.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>(If this is to be our future...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>(I have to know.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>(I have to know that the battles we fought... That the lives my friends sacrificed... That the end of our world, our history, our Alchemy...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>(I have to know that it wasn't all for nothing!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>(I have to see that our past can be entrusted to this future!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>(No matter how cruel reality may be...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>(I can't turn my eyes away from it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I'm going to go see my brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I won't let you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>(If you can find some small sliver of hope in the absolute despair brought on by the flow of time...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I'm going to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Even so, what I need is for you to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>(Then time just might ally itself with you.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>(All I can do...is pray.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I'm not going to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Dang straight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Because I'm going with you, to ensure your safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Well, if you insist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Just this once! Don't get used to it!</td>
