<td>001</td>
<td>What good weather.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey, don't you guys think so too? I want to spend my time relaxing like this forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Mm. I'll take a quick nap...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh! A dream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Is something wrong, Mage Flamel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No...it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Is that so? Your talent is one that cannot be replaced. Please take care of yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes...I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sigh. Why do people talk to me every time our paths cross.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's a long time since I've come to this country, but I'm still not used to it at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Every day it's reports, communication, and consultations. Everywhere I go, I have to talk with someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wasn't this supposed to be based fully on my merit and no other additional abilities?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sigh... Let's return to my room. I don't want to see anyone anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A talent that can't be replaced, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Chirp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hello, bird.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Chirp?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yeah, I got a little tired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Besides, I can't release you guys inside the court.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This ability to summon animals...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The elders said it was the strange ability of creating spirits, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>For me, it's just everyday life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Chirp...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh? What? Wait! Don't disappear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The animals don't respond. No. Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What should I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I doubt I can find how to fix it even if I were to hit the library.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>After all, there's no precedent to my talent. I'm the only one who has it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Could there be a chance that I might not be able to meet the animals again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ah. Mage Flamel, what are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh, what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh. Did I surprise you? You appeared to be in a troubled state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I-it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Are you certain? Oh, that's right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Mage Flamel, you're from Saga, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes, I am. What about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Well, that area remains a land of mystery that is alive with ancient lore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I was thinking of telling a story of ancient magic to my students who occupy their minds with management and theories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>However, I've been having a hard time understanding the concept of a shaman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Um. I'm not especially...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Are they individuals who hear the voices of...spirits? What does it mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I think it's some metaphor, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hm? Is something the matter? Ah, Mage Flamel! Where are you going?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's right. The shaman living in the forest of Saga may be able to help me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Where is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I don't remember the forest of Saga being so dense. I guess usually the animals would guide me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ack. My feet can't take anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Maybe it was a mistake to come here alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Right. I'm alone right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I really can't hear the voices of the animals. Nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What are you doing here, stranger?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Wh-who's there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'd like to ask the same of you. Why have you intruded within my forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Oh, um, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>So you can't answer. My guess is you're up to something suspicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Th-that's not true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I just never expected to meet someone in a place like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hmm. I guess that means you're lost. It's rare, but not unheard of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>In that case, I'll lead you outside the forest. Don't come straying back in again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What do you mean 'no'? I doubt a layman like you would have any reason to be within an ancient forest like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I-I heard that there was a shaman in the forest of Saga who could hear the voices of spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What would you want from such an individual?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Well, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I had the power to create animals, but I can't use it anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>The animals I summoned, well, they were artificial spirits, so I thought a shaman might be able to hear them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Are you telling me you can create spirits with your bare hands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ye-yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I would be hard-pressed to believe your story. A human who can create spirits? You jest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Bu-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Judging from your appearance, you're not from this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You're not one of Gluttony Foss's hyenas, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I-I came from Lustburg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>That's absurd! Am I supposed to believe that you traveled across numerous countries to get here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Yes. It was really far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Hey, what's with the bizarre answers?! I feel like I'm stabbing at air!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Y-you're the one that's asking me all the questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Hmm. This is going nowhere, shaman of the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Huh? What? Where did that voice come from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Can you hear it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, it sounds similar to the voice of the animals who respond to my call.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Oh. How rare. You're of Saga blood, yet mixed with that of others as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Shaman, his blood is that of our kind. It is not of the same color as those from Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Um. Do you believe me now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I'll take your word that you're not from Gluttony Foss. Howeverâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Shaman, something is going on in the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>The forest...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Ah! A herd of monsters is approaching from within the forest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Agggggh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I-I forgot that the animals don't come now even when I summon them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Gah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Sigh. It can't be helped. Stand back, you who have lost your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Whatever the reason, I cannot abandon one who also hears the voice of the spirits.</td>
</tr>
