<td>Are you safe, Agatha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Argh! This is all my fault!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Now is the time for me to step up my game. Why can't I use Alchemy properly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...When you're unsure of yourself, it only weakens the art.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Dias! What're you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I was passing nearby, so I came to see how you were doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>A Paladin told me that an Alchemist's power sways according to their mental state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Don't be distracted by things that have already happened. Instead of focusing on the past, look ahead to the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't focus on the past, but look ahead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah, I see what you mean. No matter how much you overthink something, you can't turn back time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You have to focus on what you're gonna do in the future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wow, that didn't take much to convince you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Dias, I was convinced by watching the way you handle yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The way I handle myself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes. Are you doing well in the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh? Mm, well, I guess so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>After I joined, I realized it's a lot different than I had imagined it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I thought it was filled with people who abused their power, but they are surprisingly resolute and strong-willed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see. Then it must suit you well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You have an almost over-zealous drive and determination to change the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Especially when it involves Agatha, you can be even too stubborn for me to handle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It might be your feelings for the real sister you lost that are making you feel that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>See what I mean? Look at you, Dias.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You disliked the Holy Guard because they couldn't save your real sister Yuffie, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But now you've discarded those emotions in order to save Agatha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You're a walking example to me of someone who doesn't focus on the past but looks ahead to the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ah! I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to bring up your painful past!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No, it's all right. Yes...that's it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This, right here, is the cornerstone of my mental strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Thank you, Logi. Don't worry. I'm going to protect both you and Agatha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>H-hey! Dias!</td>
