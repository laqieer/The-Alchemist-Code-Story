<td>What could the Ruinmaker be doing here alone, separated from the knights of Wratharis?</td>

<td>Most curious...</td>

<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Oh, yes, sorry. I had initially theorized it may be a ploy to mislead us, but now I'm thinking that may not be the case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>There have been rumors going around that the Holy Guard and Inquisitors are frequenting Wratharis of late. I'm wondering if this may be somehow related.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>An astute correlation. You may be correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Why the long face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>Well... There are those among the general populace of Wratharis who truly believe this war to be the right path, are there not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Certainly. Many innocent civilians there incurred tragic losses during our war for independence. Surely some enmity must remain in their hearts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>Yet despite that, Theresa specifically chose to distance herself from the knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>She did.</td>

<td>Understood. Thank you.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sold.png" alt="Envylia Soldier" height="128"><br>Envylia Soldier</td>
<td>Near here? There is this one mine a ways away. It was abandoned a while back. Could make a suitable hideaway, potentially.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sold.png" alt="Envylia Soldier" height="128"><br>Envylia Soldier</td>
<td>Thing is, it's known to be quite dangerous. Full of monsters who'll bite your head off in one go. You might find yourself hidden away for good! So nobody goes near the place these days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>(Monsters should be no problem for her. A deserted mine like that seems like just the place.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Thank you. I believe I'll go check out that mine, then. The rest of you, please head back to camp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>What? Are you planning to go alone?! Unthinkable! I'm coming with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>I'll be just fine on my own, really. I'm only going to take a quick look around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>

<tr>

<td>I need you to help guard the village. Don't fight me on this. Please.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>Ghh. All right. Do as you wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Senior Knight</td>
<td>Umm... We'll head back out on patrol, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sold.png" alt="Envylia Soldier" height="128"><br>Envylia Soldier</td>
<td>Oh, there is one more thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sold.png" alt="Envylia Soldier" height="128"><br>Envylia Soldier</td>
<td>I've been entrusted with a message from the Secret Ops for you, Lady Priscilla. Here.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Is that...the smell of ash and soot? What's burning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Aha! There you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>Do they teach all Envylian knights to draw their weapons on those they meet off the battlefield?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Explain your presence here. Are you planning an assault on the nearby munitions factory?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Is skulking about like some vermin the way you intend to end all war?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>Assaulting a munitions factory? That would just bring about more conflict. I would never engage in such acts of terrorism.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Then what are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Man of Riddles</td>
<td>I was told the Ruinmaker would be alone, but it seems a stray has seen fit to join her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>And just who are you supposed to be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Man of Riddles</td>
<td>That doesn't matter. Killing two is no more effort than killing one.</td>
