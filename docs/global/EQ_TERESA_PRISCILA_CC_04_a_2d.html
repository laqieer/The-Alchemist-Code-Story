<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>What could the Ruinmaker be doing here alone, separated from the knights of Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Most curious...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Kalmia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh, yes, sorry. I had initially theorized it may be a ploy to mislead us, but now I'm thinking that may not be the case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>There have been rumors going around that the Holy Guard and Inquisitors are frequenting Wratharis of late. I'm wondering if this may be somehow related.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>An astute correlation. You may be correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why the long face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well... There are those among the general populace of Wratharis who truly believe this war to be the right path, are there not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Certainly. Many innocent civilians there incurred tragic losses during our war for independence. Surely some enmity must remain in their hearts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yet despite that, Theresa specifically chose to distance herself from the knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>She did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Emotions are contagious, both positive and negative. They spread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If you hate, all you receive is hate in return. If you rage, all you see is anger from those around you. It's a never-ending cycle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Pardon the interruption! I wish to report that we've thoroughly investigated the immediate area, but found no sign of Theresa as of yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Understood. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Pity. I'd hoped for a chance to cross her path once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I wonder, is there any place nearby where a person might be able to hide away undetected for a spell?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Near here? There is this one mine a ways away. It was abandoned a while back. Could make a suitable hideaway, potentially.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Thing is, it's known to be quite dangerous. Full of monsters who'll bite your head off in one go. You might find yourself hidden away for good! So nobody goes near the place these days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Monsters should be no problem for her. A deserted mine like that seems like just the place.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Thank you. I believe I'll go check out that mine, then. The rest of you, please head back to camp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What? Are you planning to go alone?! Unthinkable! I'm coming with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'll be just fine on my own, really. I'm only going to take a quick look around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Butâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I need you to help guard the village. Don't fight me on this. Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ghh. All right. Do as you wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Umm... We'll head back out on patrol, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, there is one more thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I've been entrusted with a message from the Secret Ops for you, Lady Priscilla. Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Th-this is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The monsters are agitated. Someone's definitely been here before me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Is that...the smell of ash and soot? What's burning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Aha! There you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Do they teach all Envylian knights to draw their weapons on those they meet off the battlefield?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Explain your presence here. Are you planning an assault on the nearby munitions factory?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Is skulking about like some vermin the way you intend to end all war?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Assaulting a munitions factory? That would just bring about more conflict. I would never engage in such acts of terrorism.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Then what are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I was told the Ruinmaker would be alone, but it seems a stray has seen fit to join her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And just who are you supposed to be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That doesn't matter. Killing two is no more effort than killing one.</td>
</tr>
