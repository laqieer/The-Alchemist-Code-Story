<td>Hmm... Ancient ruins. This other world is quite interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Though I don't enjoy not having a clue where I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Still... My first time in another world. This could be fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh... It seems I don't have the luxury of indulging, unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I should clear this out quickly and meet up with Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hey, King?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yeah, Diane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Am I the only one that thinks we're going in circles?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What a coincidence. I was about to ask you the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What is going on?! Captain, where are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry, Diane. I think it's because we're in a different world, but I just can't sense anybody's magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hey, King?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yeah, Diane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Am I the only one getting a bad feeling about all this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What a coincidence... I was about to ask you the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ugh! Where is everybody?! Anybody?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wh-whoa! Watch it! That's a hammer you're swinging around! Stop! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Grrooooooohh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yo, Cap'n... Is it just me, or is this thing stronger than it was before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh, you thought so too? I thought that might be the case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Got any ideas why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmm... Maybe because we're in a different world? Maybe it's absorbing some energy or something from this place. That's my best guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Jeez... Dragged into some trouble again. Let's get this over with and find a way home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We need to find Elizabeth and the others, first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You think the princess is here too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I know she is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, we'd better get this over with and go pick her up then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yeah... Wait for me, Elizabeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hm... Still not enough to connect the two worlds again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Though it's another world entirely, the laws of nature seem to be quite similar to that of our own. I'll need to experiment some more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I would appreciate it if you would not interrupt my experiments, though you don't seem to be the reasonable type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No choice but to deal with you now, I suppose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Grrroooooooaahh!</td>
