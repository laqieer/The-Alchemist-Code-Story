<td>001</td>
<td>Aghh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>N-nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No way... Is that really Captain Yauras?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I can't believe it! Are you all really here? Truly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Kanon... This isn't the end. The outcome of this battle hasn't been preordained. Time spent looking to the divine for answers is time that you can spend trying to come up with your own solutions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Right, right...but there's no need to be so harsh, Seida. I mean, if she hadn't taken that moment to call for Excalibur, we wouldn't have our chance for payback now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wh-what's going on?! I can't understand... I thought... I thought all of you had lost your lives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh, we're definitely dead. Just to be clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I see... Phantoms, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Phantoms?! But...they look...so alive. I mean, they look like they used to when they were alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hm... I will concede that my memories are unexpectedly intact for a Phantom. Perhaps that is thanks to Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That would explain it. If Excalibur was used as a catalyst for our summoning, it may have allowed us to be summoned forth as we were at the end of our lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I mean, that's my analysis of the situation, but there's really no telling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I see! So that's what Captain Cadanova meant when he said to believe in Excalibur!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Then...it was Kanon who summoned you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Not quite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The moment you called to Excalibur was the catalyst which allowed us to be summoned, but...I believe it was someone else who summoned us forth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What...? Who could it be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ha...hahaha... You people just don't give up, do you? How fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What can the dead, even freshly risen, do in the face of utter destruction? Nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh, right. This is no time to be chatting like this. We have to do something about that ball of dark energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>R-right! I just...don't know what we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yeah... That guy's making use of powers from another dimension. Not gonna lie. It's not to be underestimated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Still, give it a moment's thought. He specifically said he would transform Northern Pride into scorched earth. "Transform."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Okay, and...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Come on! "Transform"? Like...a chemical reaction? No? Nothing? I mean, it's obvious that Cursed Sun is just an attack based on thermodynamics and has a physical mass of its own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>In other words, it is possible to deal with it using science.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hey! Hey, I was on a roll! The one time I get to display my astonishing knowledge and experience as a researcher...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Fine, whatever... Seida, can I ask you to cover me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I've been waiting on you. This conversation has dragged on for too long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Seriously? I don't get any respect around here. Whatever. Focus... Final Atmosphere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The ball of dark energy stopped moving?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Final Atmosphere?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ahem, it's actually, um, just a normal Ill Atmosphere. I mean, come on, doesn't "Final Atmosphere" sound way better?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>My Cursed Sun was frozen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yeah. Pop quiz! What happens when something that has been frozen solid is dealt a physical blow with enough strength?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What...? No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Twin Fang God Wolf!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Everyone, get down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wh-whoa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It shattered into tiny pieces! Yes!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Nnrk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>He's taken damage from that as well! Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wait! It's too early to let our guard down! Stay back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Nngh... Sol, are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Sol...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hm? Yes, I'm fine, of course. Something at this level isn't worth your concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Now, then... Shall we? Oh, hey! Captain Kudan! You're looking good! I thought you were dead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I mean, not that I can talk, having actually been dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I am grateful for your assistance in this battle. I do not feel deserving of standing on the same side of the battlefield with you any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What's with that? Of course we'll help you. I mean, now that we all know that we're on the side trying to save the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>We have always been on the same side. Our methods and justice may have been different, but there was never any time that our goals were counter to yoursâ€”to save the future of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Captain Vettel... I cannot fully express my gratitude to you and the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>If it was just the Holy Guard in this fight, we would have fallen a long time ago. There are not enough thanks in the world for what you have done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>So you all have become Phantoms... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I apologize that this is how we are meeting again. Um... Ahem. Ahem! Could you not look at me like that? You're gonna make me blush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Captain Vettel... Phantoms are basically like...ghosts or something, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Kid, could you show a little more sensitivity over here? Words can hurt, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Everyone... I'm so sorry... If only I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You have nothing to apologize for, Kagura. You've done well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You've borne the weight of the hopes we passed on to you better than we could have imagined. Be proud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>After all, you were the one who neutralized the Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>If you hadn't done that, there's no way any of us could have made it this far. You've done an incredible job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Th-thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Kanon, all of us have personally fought with that man. Our experience should be helpful to you now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>If all of the Captains of the Holy Guard stand together, there is nothing that can stand in our way. Right, Captain Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Heheh. In other words, you reanimated cadavers have shown up to get your revenge? Psh, then all we have to do is kill you again. Right, boss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Huh? Ah, right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Hey, what's with you? It's not like you to get distracted when we've got business to take care of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Right, of course. It's nearly time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Annihilate them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Here they come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>They're really coming at us with the intent to kill this time! Get ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>G-get ready, you say...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It's pointless. There will be no mercy now that we have received our kill orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>My offensive is all-encompassing... There is no way for any of you to escape death!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Wh-whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>No! There's no way to come away from an attack like that without significant damage! Everyone, watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Fools. I already know how you fight. I know how to predict your movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Oh no! I should have been more careful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I've caught you. This is the end for you. Goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Ah, crap... Is this seriously how it ends? All of us done in by this one person?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>How unrefined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>My attack was deflected?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I am sure I told you before... Speaking like that is crude and improper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Yauras!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Long time no see, Miuna. Perhaps not since I crossed swords with Cadanova.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Focus. If you do so, no matter what she claims, this attack can be dodged. Don't give up so quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Captain Yauras...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Kagura, be more confident. It is only natural that you have been intimidated after having witnessed the depths of their savage strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>However, you cannot allow that to affect your ability to read the battlefield. You cannot forget that you are one of the most dangerous people for them here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Remember. Of all the people here, you have seen the most of what they are capable of. That means that you are the person most likely to be able to read their movements on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Oh! I see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>We can win this, my friends! The Holy Guard cannot lose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>We carry the burden of ensuring peace with our absolute justice! We cannot let it fall here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You there. Can you keep going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>My sympathies. You may have arrived in time to save them this time, but nothing has changed. Their fate has already been sealed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Here she comes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I will hold her off! You all must take the opportunity to analyze how she attacks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>You plan to take me on by yourself? Hmph. Impossible! This is the end for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Captain Yauras!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Calm down. No matter what kind of attack this is, the fact remains that I am the target. In other words...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Whatever attack it is, wherever it comes from, however many there are, it is mine to deal with! I will deflect it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Whoa! She really deflected the whole barrage?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Not yet! Captain Yauras, behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>What theâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Hm?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>That was close! I didn't expect her to have such speed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Ha! I got it! She distracts with a showy flurry of attacks, and then, while her opponent is still reeling, goes for the back! An old, but reliable trick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>You don't scare me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>No, it's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I don't know what you think you have figured out, but you haven't won just because you were able to deflect my attack once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I have to be honest. When I first saw you fight, I saw someone who had managed to turn every part of her body into a weapon. I couldn't find a single opening...at first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>At first?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I realized something when I watched you shoot out your false left eye. You have a single blind spot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>A blind spot...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>It's located somewhere that your good right eye could never be able to see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>The area that your left peripheral vision would cover. Your right eye could never make up for that particular blind spot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Youâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Exactly, and now...there's no reason to chase her, because someone is already standing in that spot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Thank you, Kagura. Without your insight, I would have never been able to get this close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Single-mindedly following after the person you idolize more than anyone else... I can understand why you would do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>However, there is no way that I can allow you to eliminate the people who are here with me. I think that you can understand that feeling too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Acht!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Where do you think you're going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Do you really have the time to be worrying about someone else? It's time for our second round.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Persistent, aren't you? I don't have time to play right now, but rest assured I will be right back to grind your face into the ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>We won't just let you go! You're too dangerous! The three of us will take you down right here, right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Three...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Binding Arrow!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Whatâ€”?! Nnrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Wh-what is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>We're done letting you confound us with your supernatural agility. We won't let you move freely anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I don't have time to waste on this fight either. I won't underestimate you and let you get away again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Tch! What do these guys think they're doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Don't think we'll just let you do whatever you want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Excuse me? Who do you think you are? I'll destroy you, you little upstart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Wh-whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>You are a powerful enemy. You have proved that to us, abundantly. We won't underestimate you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Really, it's actually kind of inconvenient how strong you are. Ready, Basheeny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>You think you can stop me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Raaaarrrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Grk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Captain Vettel! Basheeny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Ugh, I can't believe I have to waste my time on you. Hurry up and let me smash you all to pieces! Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Nngh... Just...as planned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>O-of course we never thought...that we would be able to stop you...on our own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Wh-what is this?! Ice is forming on my arm?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Sorry, you two... I didn't want you to have to suffer like this, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Thanks to your help, seems like I get the chance at a round two with this guy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>You again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Neun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Hmph. Seems like the tide has turned for you, hasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Tch... While you're here distracting me, Orion is attempting to summon Nimul down unto this world! I don't have time for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>That is the reason you destroyed the tribes of Saga? You will pay for what you have done to them today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Die!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>I...am not so easy to kill, you realize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Grk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>I will explain this to you again, slowly this time. There is only one person who stands a chance of stopping me. That person is Orion, who carries the Alchemy of Power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>No matter how many little friends you have, you will never defeat me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Not only has he broken free, but to do so much damage in the process...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Is there no limit to his power?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>S-something's not...right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>I'm almost certain that I was able to land a strike on him using that opening that Reimei created for me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Yet, he fights as if that never happened at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>No, I'm sure I felt it pierce through his flesh. No matter what dimension his powers come from, his body should be flesh and blood like the rest of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Hey, you! What kind of trickery are you using?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Hey! Are you even listening to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>What...? How many times are you going to make me say this? Just give up. No matter how many of you there are, you'll never defeat me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>What are you going on about? That wasn't my question!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Blood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>I can smell blood on that man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>Blood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa... Nngrk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>At his feet... There's a pool of blood at his feet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>What? He's...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>He was hiding his injuries?! Even while fighting?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa... What? This is...the end...for you. You'd better start praying...and hope someone answers.</td>
</tr>
