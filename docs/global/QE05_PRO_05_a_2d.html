<td>Look here, Mocca. Another one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What a shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Judging from the clothing, this body, too, must have been a noble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Though they escaped to the desert, the sun and its heat must've been too much for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You would think they had some idea of how harsh traversing the desert can be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Did they really have nowhere else to run in this country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The brunt of the rebellion was pointed directly at everyone in the noble class, so I would say they did not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I wonder what will become of Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>There is nothing we can do by worrying. We should—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hurry up and find the Sephira, right? I know, I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Right. Let's not waste any time. We should be coming up to an oasis soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Mocca, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This body, it's holding one of these flower petals...like the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What is this? Do the people of Gluttony have some tradition of gripping a flower petal at the moment of their death?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That seems unlikely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Why so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Judging by how dehydrated this body is, the flower petal should have wasted away if it had been in their hand at the moment of death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You mean, someone is putting these flower petals on the dead bodies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. Maybe they mean for it to be some sort of memorial service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Could it be the Sephira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Who knows? Either way, we should hurry. If we linger, we will be joining this noble in the sand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ngh! How can you be so quick?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Sheathe your blade. I am not here to fight you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Your fighting style is unlike any swordsmanship of this continent. Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Who am I? I am the one who stands against those of you who rule this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Against us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>How tragic, that a Crowley like yourself would fall so far as to join the Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>In search of more power, you sank to the level of those bottom feeders who rule over the rest of us, and now you can no longer hear these lamentations, can you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I act on behalf of those who are crying out for justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Those who have been persecuted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>So, you are a descendant of that tragic people. That would explain your peculiar style.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You, too, have a past that cannot be forgotten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I-I mean, I'm the one asking questions here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Answer me! A member of the Corpse who works in the shadows should have the information I need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>And you think I would simply answer your questions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If you will not give me the answers I seek, I will just force them out of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What is this black water?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Beast Art Evocations! Book Two, Snake Bind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Urk?! Huzzaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>He dodged by using his sword as a foothold?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I am the Captain of the Holy Guard's 4th Regiment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>As one who bears responsibility for the lives of my fellow Paladins, I cannot be bested here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The cries of my people, exploited and persecuted in an era long past...</td>
