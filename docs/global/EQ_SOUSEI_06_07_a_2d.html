<td>002</td>
<td>Yna? What is he saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's very simple, young lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You've been searching for members of the Infinite Serpent. You wanted to catch them, talk to them. A very rational idea if I say so myself. However—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>There was one right under your noses and you missed him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No way! You're saying Yna was part of the Infinite Serpent?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...Sorry. I know I should've told you sooner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh, I don't blame you at all. Why would you ever want your new friends to know about your dark past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You would've done anything, wouldn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>To bring back that ruined Avaritia Belt of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, in the end you abandoned us for brighter pastures. To search for the Sephira people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Though I suppose your little venture wasn't without merit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Thanks to that, I could finally get the exact coordinates of the Gula Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Which had been so rudely been hidden by its god before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>In other words, you can thank good old Yna here for Zafeiris's appearance in the Gula Belt. Shocking, wouldn't you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...I... I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Do you even know why he's working with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>To destroy all sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...Have you been watching us this entire time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>How very perceptive of you. Space-Time Manipulation is a useful thing, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Agh, you're the worst...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The two of you have grown strong... I suppose it's true that disciples will take after their master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>These revelations of yours are indeed shocking, but what was the point in telling us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yna has become one of our friends and allies. So if you were hoping to cause a disagreement between all of us—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh, not at all. I just wanted to extend an invitation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>An invitation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why don't you come back to us, Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'll have to pass. The future the Infinite Serpent wishes to save runs counter to my own goals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And...I've already given up. The things that were lost. The things that were robbed from me. They will never come back again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What if I told you there was a way to get them back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Everywhere you've gone. Everything you've fought. This entire time you've all been dancing in the palm of the Serpent's hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's their intention to allow you choose the future. To let you be the final key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But what I wish is to change the past. Return that which is was lost and stop catastrophe from ever taking root. Is that not what we all wish for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No way... So your goal is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Exactly. To change history. To go back to before the Cursed Beasts were born and rewrite that which caused this suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You can't tell me you're not interested. Wouldn't you like to see your sister again, Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hold up! The stuff you're talking about is impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Forget about going back to before the Beasts were born! There's not enough magil in the world to pull that off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You'd need at least as much magil as—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>—a Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh. Now I get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The rest of us don't get it at all! Can someone explain, please?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Space-Time Manipulation is exactly what it sounds like. A way to manipulate both time and space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>So, theoretically, you could use it to travel to the past or future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But you need LOADS of magil to pull it off. Even Ambrosia gave up on ever trying it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But if you had the power of a Cursed Beast...and two cores on top of that... Some madman might just be able to convert that to a massive power source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...It's just like what Icona wanted to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Are you going to repeat that same experiment here? To wield the power of the Cursed Beasts?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You catch on quickly. Well, Icona was, well, something of a dreamer. Unfortunately, that didn't work out for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It isn't easy to control the Beasts. It is extremely dangerous. As you saw, it can become the last thing you try to do in an instant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Returning to the past, however? Why, I'd just need to pull it off once. I simply need to get back to a time before all of this started. Before it was too late to stop them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Luckily, you've already proven that the Cursed Beasts can be beaten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You'll be able to save everyone if you follow my plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Not just the ones here. Those who lost their lives. Those you couldn't save. Everything that was lost up till now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Surely, it is not such a difficult question? Why the hesita—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The ground is shaking again—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It's started!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>This feels like the rumbling we felt back when the volcano erupted. Does that mean—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Fraid so. This rumbling is unmistakable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The night of fire rain has started!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Mt. Shinai has shown its true form. Satna is fat, sated and ripe for the harvest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Wait! We haven't finished our conversation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>My queen, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Live and do whatever you desire, Sulva. My brother would've wanted it that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Quence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I'll give you a little more time to think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I'll be waiting by the crater of the holy Mt. Shinai, Satna's temple and lair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>He got away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>This feels familiar... I think he went outside!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Quick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>W-wait—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>That's Mt. Shinai! That must be where Quence went!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Nimul, look out! The fire that's raining down is taking shape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>More of them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>So many rueful, cursed lives. The destruction I bring will precipitate an end to my silence, my anger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Nimul! We've got to deal with this corruption first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Right. Got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Are you ready, Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>The old dog isn't here?! Where did he go?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>There's no time to think about that now! They're coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Perish! Perish! Perish!</td>
</tr>
