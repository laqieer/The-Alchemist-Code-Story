<td>It's very simple, young lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>You've been searching for members of the Infinite Serpent. You wanted to catch them, talk to them. A very rational idea if I say so myself. However—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>There was one right under your noses and you missed him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>No way! You're saying Yna was part of the Infinite Serpent?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>...Sorry. I know I should've told you sooner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Oh, I don't blame you at all. Why would you ever want your new friends to know about your dark past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>You would've done anything, wouldn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>To bring back that ruined Avaritia Belt of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Well, in the end you abandoned us for brighter pastures. To search for the Sephira people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Though I suppose your little venture wasn't without merit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Thanks to that, I could finally get the exact coordinates of the Gula Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Which had been so rudely been hidden by its god before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>In other words, you can thank good old Yna here for Zafeiris's appearance in the Gula Belt. Shocking, wouldn't you say?</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Do you even know why he's working with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>To destroy all sin.</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>How very perceptive of you. Space-Time Manipulation is a useful thing, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>Agh, you're the worst...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>These revelations of yours are indeed shocking, but what was the point in telling us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Yna has become one of our friends and allies. So if you were hoping to cause a disagreement between all of us—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Oh, not at all. I just wanted to extend an invitation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>An invitation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Why don't you come back to us, Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>I'll have to pass. The future the Infinite Serpent wishes to save runs counter to my own goals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>And...I've already given up. The things that were lost. The things that were robbed from me. They will never come back again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>What if I told you there was a way to get them back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Everywhere you've gone. Everything you've fought. This entire time you've all been dancing in the palm of the Serpent's hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>It's their intention to allow you choose the future. To let you be the final key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>But what I wish is to change the past. Return that which is was lost and stop catastrophe from ever taking root. Is that not what we all wish for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>No way... So your goal is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Exactly. To change history. To go back to before the Cursed Beasts were born and rewrite that which caused this suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>You can't tell me you're not interested. Wouldn't you like to see your sister again, Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>Hold up! The stuff you're talking about is impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>Forget about going back to before the Beasts were born! There's not enough magil in the world to pull that off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>You'd need at least as much magil as—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_niku.png" alt="Nyx" height="128"><br>Nyx</td>
<td>—a Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>Oh. Now I get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adre.png" alt="Adaleigh" height="128"><br>Adaleigh</td>
<td>The rest of us don't get it at all! Can someone explain, please?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_niku.png" alt="Nyx" height="128"><br>Nyx</td>
<td>Space-Time Manipulation is exactly what it sounds like. A way to manipulate both time and space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_niku.png" alt="Nyx" height="128"><br>Nyx</td>
<td>So, theoretically, you could use it to travel to the past or future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>But you need LOADS of magil to pull it off. Even Ambrosia gave up on ever trying it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>But if you had the power of a Cursed Beast...and two cores on top of that... Some madman might just be able to convert that to a massive power source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>...It's just like what Icona wanted to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Are you going to repeat that same experiment here? To wield the power of the Cursed Beasts?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>You catch on quickly. Well, Icona was, well, something of a dreamer. Unfortunately, that didn't work out for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>It isn't easy to control the Beasts. It is extremely dangerous. As you saw, it can become the last thing you try to do in an instant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Returning to the past, however? Why, I'd just need to pull it off once. I simply need to get back to a time before all of this started. Before it was too late to stop them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Luckily, you've already proven that the Cursed Beasts can be beaten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>You'll be able to save everyone if you follow my plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Not just the ones here. Those who lost their lives. Those you couldn't save. Everything that was lost up till now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Surely, it is not such a difficult question? Why the hesita—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>The ground is shaking again—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>It's started!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adre.png" alt="Adaleigh" height="128"><br>Adaleigh</td>
<td>This feels like the rumbling we felt back when the volcano erupted. Does that mean—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Fraid so. This rumbling is unmistakable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>The night of fire rain has started!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Mt. Shinai has shown its true form. Satna is fat, sated and ripe for the harvest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Wait! We haven't finished our conversation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/surub.png" alt="Sulva" height="128"><br>Sulva</td>
<td>My queen, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>Live and do whatever you desire, Sulva. My brother would've wanted it that way.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Quence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>I'll give you a little more time to think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>I'll be waiting by the crater of the holy Mt. Shinai, Satna's temple and lair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
