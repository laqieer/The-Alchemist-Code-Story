<td>Morning, Margaret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>G-good morning, Miss Elizabeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh! You're looking much better. You should be able to start going outside soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Um, M-Miss Elizabeth? Th-thank you for staying by my side, and...t-taking care of me for the last few days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's fine! I'm just trying to get this new medicine to work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Um...p-please, let me thank you, s-somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I-it's fine, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(I can't exactly tell her that the side effects were so bad that I was afraid to leave her alone for even a moment.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Besides, you've got a home to go back to soon, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I...don't have any family left. I-I'll do anything you want! I-is there anything you would, um, like?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmm... What do I want, you wonder? Well...how about a magical cure-all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ah! Th-that's...um...I... I don't think I can do that! I'm so sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hahahah. Don't worry about it. If I had to name something else I want... Well, that'd be a little sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A little sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm sure that would make Mother happy, too. It would be nice, butâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>All right. I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Then...I'm going to call you Lizzy, like I would my own big sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>L-Lizzy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I've already injected you with an antidote. You're going to be all right. Now, what happened here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wh-what are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I thought that I had stumbled across some excellent test subjects when I saw two people lying on the ground, but it turned out to just be you and that suspicious-looking scientist fellow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You've been working non-stop these past few days, and today you ran off unprepared, without any warning. I was quite worried about you, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I-I'm so sorry. I know I shouldn't have. I caused you trouble again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Margaret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>L-Lizzy... Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This is the second time you've had to heal me. I'll do anything you want! Please let me make it up to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>All right then. Please don't make me worry anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ah...to think that I would end up with such a clueless, clumsy little sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ngh! I-I promise I'll come home safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Margaret?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I will find any ingredient you need. I'll even find a magical cure-all if you ask it of me. I'll go anywhere and everywhere for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'll make sure I'm prepared, though, by, um...figuring out how to get there first, and, um... Anyway, I won't make you worry about me anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm going to be a good little sister!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I feel like the conversation has strayed somewhat... Well, in any case, that sounds good. Do your best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>And you can use me for your experiments any time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That won't be happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Why not?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Make sure you come home safe, all right? I'll be waiting for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Got it! You can count on me, Lizzy!</td>
