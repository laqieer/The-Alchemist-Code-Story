<td>Wa-was that a girl being attacked by a monster?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>He-hey, who are you guys?! Hey! Don't come any closer! If you're gonna attack me, at least do it one at a time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(I should help her, shouldn't I?)</td>

<td>Umph!</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>O-of course, I'm okay! That was nothing back there!</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Are you going into the forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes. I'm going to get some nectar from the Garden of Evil. The flowers there should be in blossom during this season.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The Garden of Evil is dangerous. There's a lot of monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I know. But I need the nectar to make the witches' elixir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>In that case, I'll go with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What are you talking about? You just told me it's dangerous.</td>

<td>I appreciate your offer, but I'll have to turn you down. I can't take responsibility for your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Stop nagging me. I told you that I don't need your help. Bye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I wonder if she got mad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Why doesn't she want my help? Maybe she doesn't like me...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ackkk!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
