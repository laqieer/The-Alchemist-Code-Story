<td>Minor conflicts and troubles aside, Envylia is experiencing a period of relative peace and tranquility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>King of Envylia</td>
<td>The Lion Monarch's Charge has left a scar on this world, and Envylia has not escaped that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>King of Envylia</td>
<td>But I consider myself lucky that so many splendid Envylian knights have made it through alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>King of Envylia</td>
<td>The Scarlet Flame Guard especially has been a great help in maintaining the peace and the reconstruction efforts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Cleric</td>
<td>I see... But was Envylia not one of the countries that incurred the greatest damage in the last war?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Cleric</td>
<td>I heard the Blue Flame Guard especially suffered great losses. Can the Scarlet Flame Guard truly shoulder both of their duties? Is it not too much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vett.png" alt="Vettel" height="128"><br>Vettel</td>
<td>...It is a difficult situation, true. But we cannot sit and lick our wounds while people are still suffering from the aftershocks of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vett.png" alt="Vettel" height="128"><br>Vettel</td>
<td>For now, we simply have to support each other by filling in where the Blue Flame Guard cannot. It is our responsibility to do all that we can to protect the happiness of the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Cleric</td>
<td>I see... I believe I've got a grasp of the situation now. Thank you for delivering your report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Cleric</td>
<td>We'd also like to formally extend our gratitude to Envylia for sending Bud and Victor to help us in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Cleric</td>
<td>I hope we can continue to cooperate to promote peace across all of Babel. I suppose I should let you get back toâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vett.png" alt="Vettel" height="128"><br>Vettel</td>
<td>I'm sorry to interrupt, but there is still one thing left to report. My knights informed me that ruins were discovered near the borders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Cleric</td>
<td>Ruins, you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vett.png" alt="Vettel" height="128"><br>Vettel</td>
<td>Indeed. They appear to be quite old. We don't know what we may find inside, but we'd like to start conducting an investigation of it as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Cleric</td>
<td>Hm. The Holy Order will send one of our own to conduct an investigation first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Cleric</td>
<td>Please refrain from carrying out your own investigation until we give you the go ahead. Old ruins are often rife with alchemy and other such things that are hazardous to the average fellow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Cleric</td>
<td>We'd also like to inspect it while it's still in pristine condition. We appreciate your understanding on this matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>King of Envylia</td>
<td>You did well in there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vett.png" alt="Vettel" height="128"><br>Vettel</td>
<td>Phew. That took a while... My shoulders are all stiff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vett.png" alt="Vettel" height="128"><br>Vettel</td>
<td>I shouldn't say this as the Captain, but I feel pretty awkward in formal situations like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>King of Envylia</td>
<td>Haha, but you performed well. I am more concerned about what the Holy Cleric said... Perhaps we have been relying too much upon the Scarlet Flame Guard. Are you truly getting enough rest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>King of Envylia</td>
<td>The Blue Flame Guard is on the road to recovery, but we may yet need to lean heavily on the Crown's Guard till then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>King of Envylia</td>
<td>Unreasonable or not, I fear that this country needs you to lend us your knights a little longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vett.png" alt="Vettel" height="128"><br>Vettel</td>
<td>Please leave it to us. I'd also like to remind you that the knight who is escorting you, Chloe, is very capable as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vett.png" alt="Vettel" height="128"><br>Vettel</td>
<td>You can call on the two of us any time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>King of Envylia</td>
<td>Hm. I suppose I should go find her. I will see you again, Vettel.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/vett.png" alt="Vettel" height="128"><br>Vettel</td>
<td>This place... It's closer to the village than I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vett.png" alt="Vettel" height="128"><br>Vettel</td>
