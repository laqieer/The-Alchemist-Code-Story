<td>We couldn't have been carried far. Where is this?</td>

<td>The deepest level of the branch. The facility's bowels, if you will...but we made sure it was just outside of Slothstein.</td>

<td>Eira is integral to Goetia's plans...as are you. Notice how little it takes for us to come to an agreement?</td>

<td>Unless you'd rather have us search in vain for an alternative, in which case I suppose we will procure as much Alchemia as is needed to wake Lachesis.</td>

<td>The heavy metal door at the far end suddenly slides open.</td>
