<td>Tsk!</td>

<td>Icky-stickies went away. Now I sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Whaâ€”? Wait a minute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'll get up when icky-stickies come. The archaeologists are safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Come to think of it, I did hear there was another team of archaeologists investigating the area. Could she be their escort?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A child like this? Surely not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Not a child. I am Rochelle. A black and white bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I am Glanz. Just a mercenary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>My name is Anastasia. Nice to meet you, little bear. By the way, what might you have there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Not little bear. A black and white bear. Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And this? Something I found. Some kind of rock. A pretty rock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>May I see it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You want it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What could this be? It isn't a Philosopher's Stone... Well, it seems harmless enough. Here you go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I can't tell with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But...not malice. No icky-sticky with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hehe. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Glizzy and Annie. I know you now. Bye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Glizzy? Is that me? And I suppose you're Annie now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If what the professor's research notes say are accurate, the Philosopher's Stone is supposed be here somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So then someone must have... And that man earlier... He did not seem like your run-of-the-mill bandit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Are others besides Wratharis investigating that ruin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Are you concerned?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>A little... How is the professor's kid doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I knew you were worried for her. She's fine. Of course there is some emotional trauma she must overcome, but we are able to make progress thanks to everything the professor left us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm just no good with these things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Though it is unfortunate the professor was lost...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You must not forget that you did manage to protect his only daughter and his work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I refuse to believe that was inconsequential. Those who survive are the ones able to look forward to the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I hope you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(I wanted to cleanse this tainted world.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(I wanted to eradicate the source of the foul odor. I wanted to carve away the clinging filth.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(But the more I tried, the more red-stained my hands became.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ugh... I wish I could take a bath soon.</td>
