<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>We're close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Their base should be just a bit further ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>All right, we're almost there! Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Already buddies with everyone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>All this almost feels like back when we were trainees, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I was always terrible at finding hidden enemies and tracking training... You always saved my skin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I don't remember it like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's true! You were always so reliable, I would've been no good without you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We were always together, weren't we? The fact we were both therians made it super easy to get along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes... I was glad to have you with me then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It was unusual for therians to want to be a knight, though it's becoming more common now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Why did you two join up, anyways?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? W-well, I wanted to...learn how best to use my strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I thought that joining the knights would be the best way to do that. What about you, D'Artagnan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's easy! Because I love Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Same as always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Eheheh. Envylia recognizes me for who I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I was born and raised here, but my mom and dad were immigrants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Everyone around me except for my family were humans. It was a little scary at first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I never thought you'd ever been afraid of humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yeah. There were times when people would be mean just 'cause I was a therian, but the other residents were always kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>They didn't view me as a therian, but as a neighbor. Even as a friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That made me so happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>When I was kidnapped, the knights worked so hard to save me. One of them told me something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>They said that the knights of Envylia protect all citizens of Envylia, no matter if they're human or therian.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I remember thinking then about how much I loved Envylia and how much I wanted to be a knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Especially a knight of the Scarlet Flame Guard, where knights don't care about where you're from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Nothing changed when they saw my power as a therian.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>They didn't see me as a human or a therian. They saw me as me. That's why I want to protect Envylia in any way I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I thought that I'd like to join the Scarlet Flame Guard if I was going to be a knight anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The Scarlet Flame Guard goes on a lot of missions, so I thought it would be the best use of my power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And now I get to go to lots of different places, meet lots of people, and learn a lot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I see. So that's why you wanted to be a knight... To you, all of Envylia is worth protecting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I think that's really cool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(D'Artagnan found a way to use her powers for good. She doesn't doubt herself.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(I have to work harder. I won't let anyone else face unnecessary danger again.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What's wrong, Yura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The trail's gone cold... I'm positive it was leading just ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But I don't see anything it could be leading to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We know it's nearby, right? If the trail disappeared all of a sudden, maybe they're using magic to hide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Even if that were the case, I should be able to feel the Alchemia, but there's nothing here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Then that must mean that something is hindering your senses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Something powerful enough to not only hide their base, but also mess with a therian's senses... That's pretty big.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>D'Artagnan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm gonna go run to the barracks real quick! You all wait here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>W-wait, D'Artagnan?! ...There she goes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wh-what do we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It seems we're stuck here for a bit. Let's take a break.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Understood. Will you be joiningâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'm going to take a look around. I've got quite a bit of stamina, so I don't need a rest yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>There must be something here, I just have to find it. I won't let anyone else get hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Now's the time to show what I can do. I'm going to protect everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>The Alchemia trail really does disappear suddenly here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If D'Artagnan is right and this is their doing, then it should be around...here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Quite the perceptive one, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>!!! You!</td>
</tr>
