<td>The Gate...is closing...! My... No! This body...fails me as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You humans... You always ruin everything! Don't think I will forget this...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, good. We...won. The Dimensional Gate...is closed. What...a...relief...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Toritoh? Toritoh! Stay with me! They didn't drain your soul, did they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No...but I seem to have...used up all of my strength... It's fine. This...is what I wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We have only known each other a short time...but it has truly been a blessing... At least...I still have my soul, if nothing else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Toritoh, no! What was the point in everything we've done until now if we can't even be together after all this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Edgar...and thank you. This time that I've spent with all of you...is very precious to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>With the people of this world...with Alphonse, and the people from Amestris, and...of course...with you, Edgar. You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Toritoh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Toritoh... Edgar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There's nothing I can say that could make this any easier for you. Toritoh... You did well. As did you, Edgar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We won't forget this. This world, this moment, these people...and Toritoh, especially.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Lieutenant, Colonel... Thank you. Oh... She's...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh, I see... Her soul is using the closing Gate to return to her own world, so this transmuted body is no longer needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Edgar, wish we could've stayed longer, but I'm glad we met!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Thank you. Goodbye, everyone. Alphonse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I feel like I've known all of you forever. I'm sorry to think that we may never meet again once the Gate is closed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Don't think like that. I believe that we are connected now and always will be, even if the Gate is closed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We might make it back here again, if you ever need us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...to fight by your side...as if we never left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Toritoh...too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wait, what? What are you talking about, Alphonse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hey, Al! If the Gate closes, we won't be able to go back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Got it, Ed! Well... Goodbye for now, Edgar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>H-hey! What do you mean...? He's gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ha. They're gone. That's a relief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I didn't want them to see me cry. Kids shouldn't have to watch a man cry. Right, Toritoh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh... Well, I have to believe that Toritoh's spirit will always be with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So, Toritoh...let's do all the things, eat all the things, and meet all the people you always wanted to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We can take my bike, and I'll show you this whole, wide world!</td>
