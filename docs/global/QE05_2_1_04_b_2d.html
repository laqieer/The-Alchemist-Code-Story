<td>General Leordas!</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Lord Kamui, is that you? I am glad to see that you are safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It was a great relief to have you come to our aid. Are the villagers here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We did the best we could to find as many survivors as we could, but the Royal Army still has the upper hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If only my warriors and I had arrived back in the village sooner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I know how you feel, but we must focus on what we can do now to overcome this situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The front line is locked in a stalemate, but we will not be able to hold the lines like this for long.</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Will adding our warriors to your ranks help?</td>

<td>Numbers are a strong factor in success on the battlefield.</td>

<td>Even considering the size of the army, available space for maneuvering troops, and possible strategies or tactics, the side with greater numbers tends to have the advantage in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Those with fewer numbers will have to rely on the strength of individuals to overcome that disadvantage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There is, however, something we must do before all else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The coming battle may be the decisive clash that finally brings about the end of this struggle between our armies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There will be no spare resources to protect those who cannot fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We must get the survivors of your village far from the field of battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Where can we take them? No matter where we run, the Royal Army will chase them down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We have someone here who's already given the issue some consideration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hello, Kamui.</td>
