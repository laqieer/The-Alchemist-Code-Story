<tr>

<tr>

<td>Why don't we begin with one of your arms?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Nothing in the world matters to you, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Nnngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Bang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You dare cull those with potential?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hmph. Such hypocrisy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Could you not use your power to strike me down instead of wasting it on the defense of these pathetic wretches?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I will do as I please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Vier, Füry... Not you too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Don't tell me you're going to give us a lecture? I think I'll pass, thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>As pearls thrown before swine... Your power could be used for so much more, yet you allow the fear of losing those around you to hold you back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I don't see anything wrong with—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Stagnation is abhorrent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huff...huff... I c-can't control...my power...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>How pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I can still...fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hmph. I suppose this must be your limit as a discarded failure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>A...what? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Well, you must have been defective in some aspect to have been discarded as you were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Wh-what do you mean, discarded?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, Iris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>When you avenged your father, did your target even remember you? Did you remember them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You learned to fight by watching me. You claimed to be good at stealing things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yet why is it, do you think, that a mere unnamed bandit like you was able to grow strong enough to fight off hordes of Wratharis soldiers in such a short span of time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Wh-what are you saying? You congratulated me. You celebrated how I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Are you sure you actually met Yauras?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The girl who calls herself Iris is nothing more than a replication of Yauras.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>A replication?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>She is much like you, Zwei. A product of Greed Dike's experiments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>They were attempting to create a soldier with unparalleled strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>They decided that replicating warriors known for their martial prowess would be most effective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Using the research data obtained from Corpses and the other prototypes, they first modified one of their test subject's bodies to be more attuned to the skill set of said warrior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>They then imbued the test subject with Yauras' genetic information, which they had obtained from the Holy Order of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>They even implanted false memories of Yauras into her mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>This was to ensure her obsession with Yauras, so that she would aspire to be more like the original. To push her to perfect the replication of her own volition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>At least, that was the plan. Unfortunately, Iris chose to focus more on her hatred than her aspirations. Such a shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Why Yauras?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It did not have to be her, I'm sure. Any accomplished warrior would have done just as well. She just happened to meet the required criteria.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Criteria?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You see, they had found an orphan with synesthesia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>This orphan was innately attracted to beauty, of both the physical form and of Alchemia. Hence Yauras was deemed a suitable figure to influence her aspirations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That is all there was to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>An...orphan? But I... The Golden Wolves...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>There has never been any band of thieves known as the Golden Wolves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>B-but... No... I'd been living with my old man since I was born!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Those are false memories. You have no father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>The overseer of the experiments was a man with golden eyes. I assume a father figure was formed in your mind based on him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Th-this can't be true! It's impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>None of it was ever true. That skull that was supposedly your father's...your little bottle of jewels...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>All of it was mere fabrication, designed to influence you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>N-no...! Fabricated...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Unfortunately, Greed Dike's experiments rarely go as planned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>The production of these replications was costing them more than they had anticipated—not to mention the lack of significant results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>The project was shut down and the test subjects were disposed of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>What better place to dispose of a test subject than in Lost Blue, the trash can of Greed Dike?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>All the memories you have of your life before coming to Lost Blue are fake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>They were never real. It was all a lie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I myself left that country, on account of my hatred for such abuse of life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I was curious to learn if even a fabricated replica could gain some sense of conviction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Such a shame it was that losing your original humanity turned you into nothing more then an empty husk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I-I... A...replication? I'm not... But when? Fake...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>This is goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>You think we're gonna let that happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Are you willing to delay the completion of your Templars?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>You're leaving, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Sol, you are our sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I am nothing more than a man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>You shine so brightly when you stand alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Yet your light is dimmed by the shadows of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Plucking you from the shade would do nothing for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>And if I were alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Well, I would hope that you would be waiting for me in anticipation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Not on your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>You are not meant to die here. The world will kill you, mark my words. The blue sky will be the one to crush you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>For my part, I look forward to witnessing it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I believe that all of you will continue to grow right up until the very moment in which you would accomplish your goals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Yet it is then, I am afraid, that you are destined to be trampled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Though your personages are so beautifully warped...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Know that this world is even more horribly twisted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Are we just going to let him go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Zwei and Sieba are in no condition to be going after him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>We lost. It's over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Sol...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>(So...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>(When I'm alone...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Attention, ladies and gentleman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I would like all of you to show me what you are capable of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>For I will be cheering you on from afar!</td>
