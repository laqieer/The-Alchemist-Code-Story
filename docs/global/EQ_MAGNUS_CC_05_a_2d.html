<td>Mind if I ask what led you to that conclusion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>
<td>Obviously, the fact that Alchemy wasn't involved. That means it's a problem for the Slothstein government, not us.</td>

<td>Wh-what?!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/kaya.png" alt="Kaya" height="128"><br>Kaya</td>
<td>Not only that, but we've just received official orders not to intervene. I'm afraid we couldn't grant you permission even if we wanted to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/othi.png" alt="Othima" height="128"><br>Othima</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Magnus...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I...</td>

<td>Good. You're not a little girl anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>I've got no idea what you mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>I... I realize I've been selfish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>
<td>You have a bit, haven't you? But that's fine. It just means you have the ability to do what you want, and make it work for those around you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>
<td>Not just anyone can do that, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Personally, I'm glad you joined the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>Because like attracts like?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>
<td>Because sometimes it takes a bunch of selfish paladins to do what's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>
<td>And that flower wouldn't be sprouting in Real Heaven right now without your help. You worked hard to create an environment where it could grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>I'm going to go back to...to pick something up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Justice isn't gonna fill your belly, remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>Maybe not, but you showed me that justice is about helping people. Not everyone can save themselves like I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>That's why I have to go. I left something there that I can't do without, and I'm going to go pick it up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
