<td>They're finally gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. It seems like they've given up for today. The stars are better aligned now. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It seems like it'll be better if I leave here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yeah? Are you going to hide somewhere?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes. I'll hide at a good friend's place for now. But, before that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Your older brother, he's alive. Right now, he is positioned under a lost star. He seems to have lost his way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But he is very smart with high ideals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And where is he right now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Tell me! Where is he?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Your brother is...in Wratharis now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes. I'm not certain what he is doing there right now. I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Are you going to go see him? It's dangerous. Surely, on the way there you'll encounter men like those from earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're right. I might as well have had those men take me with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Albea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Heh. I'm joking. Don't worry. I won't really go to see him. Right now, I can't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>When we were children...before I became aware of things, my parents split up. I went with my father and my older brother went with my mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I don't really remember my mother's face, but I remember meeting her just once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>At that time, she said to me, "You have a brother who is aiming to become an excellent Alchemist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm sure he will become a great Paladin and a wonderful Alchemist. He will be a brother that will make you proud."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Until then, I didn't even know I had a brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But, those words stuck with me for some reason. That may be why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I wanted to become a sister that my brother could be proud of. Although I wasn't that great, I did my best to improve as a mechanic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I wanted to become an excellent artisan and take over my father's studio...so that my brother would have a place to come home to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I wanted a place that my mother could come home to as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But...I couldn't do it in time and she died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I wanted to create and protect a home where he could always come back to. I wanted to make my brother proud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I see. So that was your connection to your brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes. But my brother quit the Holy Guard and gave up on being an Alchemist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I want to meet him. I want to ask why he gave up on being an Alchemist, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I don't know what I'm going to do with that information once I find out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You're scared of meeting your brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You might be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Sigh... When you gaze at me like that, I feel like talking forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Thank you for reading my fortune. How much should I pay you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You don't have to pay me anything. Instead...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Can you help me pack?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh? What a hassle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Come now. Please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Sigh... Fine. I'll help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yes! Well then, please wait a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Um...this...and this...oh, this as well...yes! This too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What? This is all a bunch of junk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>They're all things that I've received as gifts for reading fortunes. They're broken, so I can't use them, but I don't have the heart to throw them away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Sigh... So? Do you want me to pack them in a box?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Yes. Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hey...this right here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>If you tighten the screws here and here, you can still use it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oh? Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>This one as well. You just need to change the spring and it'll be okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>As for this one...it seems like the gear is rusty, but, if you brush and polish it, it'll still move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You really do know your way around these things, don't you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Of course, I do. I'm an artisan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>As for this, you can't use it anymore, but you can use the parts for this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>This watch as well, you just need to change the crown. Oh, if you just modify the parts of the watch...I think it'll fit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>If you change the crystal on this one...maybe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hey, if you don't need these things, can you give them to me? I think I might be able to make something interesting from them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Heheh. You really do like machines, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Mm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Please. Take whatever it is that you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Th-thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>The stars shine at night and disappear with the rise of the sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>But they are not gone, just invisible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Don't be afraid of the darkness. That's when the stars will shine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I must have just lost sight of my love for machinery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I'm sure there will come a time when I'll find answers about my brother as well, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Yes. I'm sure of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I'll do my best so that, when I meet him someday, he can be the one that says, "I'll be an older brother that my sister can be proud of."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Thank you for everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>May you be guided by beautiful stars. Be well, Albea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I'm glad I came.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>With the help of the other mechanics, maybe I'll remake this into a telescope that I can deliver to her new house.</td>
</tr>
