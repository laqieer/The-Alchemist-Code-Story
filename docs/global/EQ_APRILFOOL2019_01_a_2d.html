<td>Stories are often formed against the wishes of the people. As for the history of Headstrong Dias, told through the stones—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This is the sinful tale of the stone that creates all life, of Headstrong Dias, and of how they intertwine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We were always together. We breathed the same air, dreamed the same dream, and loved the same person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We laughed and cried together. We shared our joy as well as our pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Our hearts were always one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yet, somehow, of the two of us it is only Dias who is losing his way, becoming Headstrong Dias. How did this come to pass?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Agatha! There you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh? What's the matter, you two?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Leaving the main army is dangerous! What're you doing out here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What do you mean? I'm stocking up on medicinal herbs, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Medicinal herbs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is the healing prairie, Siguroardottir. Various types of medicinal herbs grow in clusters here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There are a lot of injured within the Guard, aren't there? I thought I would collect these and make plenty of healing salve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Agatha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You're right. We can never have enough medicinal herbs. Let me help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Dias...? You're willing to help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hm? What sort of herb is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's actually a kind of mushroom. An Alchemy Mushroom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I heard that someone who looked like nobility was seen planting them around here recently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Alchemy...? Would eating this give me power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What? Power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Dias?! Wait, don't! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Bottoms up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You ate it? Seriously?! You didn't even wash it! I thought you were civilized!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What were you thinking?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I must gain power, no matter what anyone says!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So stubborn... So this is Headstrong Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Agatha? What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You know, I always wanted to be an actress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Wha—?! Agatha? D-did you eat the mushroom too?! What are you two doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Agatha! Why did you eat one, too?! These Alchemy mushrooms could be...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh... Sorry! Did I worry you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>N-no, I just... Eheh. Heheh. Hehehehehehe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ew! You are not acting like yourself, Dias! This has got to be the mushroom's fault!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Back then, nobody knew that these mushrooms would be the cause of Dias' breakdown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Get down, both of you! It's Wratharis soldiers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It looks like they haven't noticed us. I wonder where they're headed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It could be Naraba Village. You can see it over there. They're famous for their herbs, so it's certainly—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Are they gonna attack the village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No, hold on! Can you see, Dias?! Monsters are attacking Naraba Village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Are the Lizard Brigade gonna try to save the village?! How hypocritical of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Perfect. We'll be able to see how the famous Wratharis soldiers fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What are you talking about, Dias! You're not going to help?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There are piles of Alchemy Mushrooms stored in that village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That settles it. We're going in to help them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Well, that was a quick change of heart. Agatha, you shouldn't stir him up like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Now, let the massacre begin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh, brother. I guess this must be Headstrong Agatha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Let's go save them, and change this sad world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oh, come off it. We already know you're after the mushrooms! Don't you have any pride as one of the main characters?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Sir Knight! Please, wait! What do you plan to do with them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What does it matter to you? The monsters have been taken care of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I will have them reveal to me where the mushrooms have gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>B-but, the Wratharis soldiers also protected the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Dias! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You came just in time. Help me get these guys to talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hey! Where is your leader Sabareta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Better yet, tell me where the mushrooms are! Hurry up and spit it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Dias! How could you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>He's become so violent all of a sudden!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I need more power! Give me the Alchemy Mushrooms!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>No wonder people call you Headstrong Dias...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Shut up! I've had it with people calling me Headstrong Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>This isn't my fault! The developers made me what I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Dias is going meta! This must be the mushroom's effects! At least, I sure hope it is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I-I've told you already! I'm not saying a word to you, you religious dogs! Hurry up and kill me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I see... Then I'll just have to rub the Alchemy Mushroom's spores into every single one of your orifices!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We'll get a good harvest of mushrooms off of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Stop it! How obsessed with mushrooms can you be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You lot are always the same!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You all think farming must be easy, because it's peasants' work! But agriculture isn't as easy as all that! No mushrooms are gonna grow down there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Our wrath has awoken a mighty power! Fear us, the mushroom farmers of Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Foolish Envylia... Your day of reckoning is at hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What is this guy saying now? Did he eat a mushroom, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Silence, rebel scum! Just let me harvest more mushrooms!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Dias, you're going too far! You're both from Wratharis! How could you do this to him?! You've gone insane!</td>
</tr>
