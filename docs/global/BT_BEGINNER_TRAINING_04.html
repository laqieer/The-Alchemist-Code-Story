<td>I've been waiting for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>There's no need for introductions anymore, is there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Have you taken into consideration Turn Orders and Agility?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>In battle, if you hover your cursor over a unit, an hourglass is displayed at the far right end of its status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The hourglass indicates CT, or Charge Time. Once this is charged up to 100, a unit may make its move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>CT is spent as actions are taken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Agility is the speed at which a unit can charge CT, and this differs among Jobs and Units.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I've mentioned this when explaining Magic, but Cast Time is required before the invocation of skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The unit icons displayed at the top-left of the battle screen indicate the Turn Order of the Units.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Keep in mind that the order displayed may change according to CT, Agility, and Cast Time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm not making you sleepy with all of this explanation, am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>All right then, it's time for combat! Keep an eye on the enemies with high Agility and try to keep damage taken to a minimum!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Now, let the brilliance of your soul guide you to the unwavering truth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hrm, was this too easy for you? You have certainly exceeded my expectations!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Turn Order can be baffling at first, but it's possible for certain units to override the rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Merchants can use Jewel Investment, and Chronomancers can use Overclock to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Do not worry. All of this will eventually come naturally to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>There is nothing more I need to teach you. You now have everything you need to fight on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What's that look for? There is no need to lament.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>My name is Ouroboros. I am the bond between Truth and the World, the Observer of Destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>When your strength nears the Truth, I shall appear before you once again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well, this is the end of our momentary affair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Now, let the brilliance of your soul guide you to the unwavering truth!</td>
