<td>Beautiful, isn't it?</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Truly a marvel! A masterpiece so brilliant even I could not fully comprehend its abilities!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Uh huh, fascinating... Truly.</td>

<td>When we first discovered Atropos within these ruins, it was of such advanced decay that we were unable to discern its functions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We decided that a rudimentary extraction of its functions in a surrogate container would be the safest choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A prototype replica, if you will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And that would be the first Atropos you unleashed upon us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Indeed. And what do you think of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Grotesque. In every sense of the word, tasteless, like the man who made it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What do you know of our hopes for the future?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Stand down, Asuka. We cannot blame them for not seeing the bigger picture.</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Forgive me, my Lord... I spoke out of turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There is nothing to forgive Asuka.</td>

<td>My Lord...</td>

<td>Siegfried... what of Shion? Is h...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Shion's fine. Just taking a time out... No one else dies today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That includes the both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Surrender yourselves. This foolish plan of yours will not bring salvation to people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The way I see it, the only real mistake is the one which we learn nothing from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I refuse to stand idle and watch the world burn itself when I am fortunate enough to be born with enough power and wealth to make a difference!</td>

<td>Atropos! Activate all remaining Constructs!</td>

<td>*WHIRRRRR!*</td>

<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Just how many Constructs are there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Siegfried! Roxanne, leave the Constructs to me!</td>

<td>You got it Teach!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Stay close to me Soren. I could sure use your help.</td>

<td>031</td>
<td>Atropos... Eliminate all who would stand in my way.</td>

<td>My Lord... Is this truly the only way? I do not wish to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's us or them Asuka. They've made their decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If they will not stand down... then they leave me no choice!</td>
