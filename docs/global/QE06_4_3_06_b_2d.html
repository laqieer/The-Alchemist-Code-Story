<td>Edgar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If we want to pick him off, we have the chance right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>N-no! That would be so cowardly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Amane. You need to save your energy. And, Edgar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We're already wounded. Tamba may well wipe us out if he attacks us again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We should strike while we have the chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Do you really think that's what anybody here wants?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If it means none of this will have been in vain... If it means I can protect my friends... If it means no sweet ladies have to cry, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah, I'm okay with being the bad guy. It's just, somebody has to say it! Striking him while he's down is the best tactical decision we could possibly make right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Edgar, stop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Forgive me, Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Calm yourself, Edgar. Put the gun down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Tamba might be an immediate threat, but he's not our true enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Were we to kill him now, we'd just be playing into the hands of the one pulling his strings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And that's something we must never abide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We may call ourselves a Demon Elimination Corps, but that doesn't mean we stain our blades with the blood of those who don't deserve to be slain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But, I thought you hated demons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I do. But what good would killing Tamba now do, as he stands on the edge of repentance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No, peace is the only way to bring about change in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Only then can those who've fallen be truly vindicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I do know where you're coming from, Edgar. When Lady Celis died, I almost lost the will to follow in her footsteps. But...it's important not to lose sight of the big picture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I will wield my blade for all those who live in Wadatsumi...be they human or demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And you don't think you're gonna regret that later?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Never.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Edgar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hey, I know when I'm beat. I got no comeback to all that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This seems a little erratic, even for you. Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I have no horse in this race. Sure, I'm no longer an outsider either, but, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm not exactly one of the parties involved. So I needed a way to objectively figure out what the best course of action was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm saying I'm not from Wadatsumi, and I'm not carrying any secret royal blood like Logi. So, uh, yeah, this isn't really my choice to make, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I just needed a way to make sure it was the right choice, one way or another. And this seemed like the quickest way to do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I see. You were trying to evaluate the situation in your own...unique manner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yep. And mission accomplished on that, for sure! I gotta say, you all really showed me just how deep your resolve goes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>As a fellow visitor to this land, I sympathize with you, Edgar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Even looking in from the outside, it's just...so painful to see what's happening here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And that's exactly why we have to watch over Tamba now. Painful or not, this is the moment that decides everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>For if all the threads can once again be tied back together, we can finally restore Wadatsumi to the way it once was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>All right, already, I gotcha! I trust you all know what you're doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Please, Tamba. Please remember! Remember what it was you wanted to protect!</td>
</tr>
