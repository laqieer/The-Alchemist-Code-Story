<td>However... However.</td>

<td>I am an accumulation of corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>As I am sure you are well aware, the Mikaboshi amplifies corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So long as corruption fills me, I will be resurrected; over and over, and over again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That is all. It is a simple matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi is mine. You cannot touch it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Then how...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The moment I was made manifest in this world, you had already lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It was an immense delight to watch you all working so hard, ignorant of the futility of your actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Truly splendid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Well, it is time for me to release the corruption from this statue, and make myself some friends.</td>
</tr>

<td>Aaaarrrrrgggghhh!</td>

<td>Ahhh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I suppose I should dispose of you first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>There is such a difference in power between us. You cannot possibly hope to bridge that gap. You are all too tired to do anything at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Nonetheless, you must be taken care of. Oh, woe is me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Nnngghhh... Aarrrgghhh... Aaaarrrrrggghhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>A difference in power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's stupid! Power isn't what decides a battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The one with greater willpower wins in the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ah! B-B-B...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Bud?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huuuuzzzzzzaaaaahhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Who is this now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Me? I'm Bud Crowley, knight of the Blue Flame Guard of Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Bud!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>H-how did you even get here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ever heard of boats?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I took a boat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>No, no, no, no, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I had to! I made a promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>A...promise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I promised to protect you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Oh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I listened to you, and I thought about everything you said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>But in the end, the only thing I really understood was that Wadatsumi is a crazy dangerous place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>W-were you even listening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I was worried about you being all alone in a dangerous place like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I couldn't stand around waiting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>So, I'm gonna borrow this neat sword I found!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Th-that's Sumeragi! Yomi must have dropped it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>It is? Perfect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Only those of the Kagomurasaki line can wield its true power! It won't work for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Please, just run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>If you have conviction, there's no need to run, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Wh-what are you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You'd put your life on the line for the destiny of the royal family, right? Well, I'm gonna put my life on the line to protect you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Wha—?! Wh-what are you saying?! You only have one life, you fool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Yep, but I'm gonna risk that life of mine for the sake of all those who have died!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>That's why you're not running, right? Well, I'm not going anywhere, either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Huzzzzzahhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Surely even you cannot be so dim as to fail to realize that you have no hope of winning here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Even if I can't win, I will protect her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Huzzzzzahhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Indeed. A loyal mutt you may be, but you are all bark and no bite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Nnrrggghh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>S-Sumeragi...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>It b-b-b... It broke?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>A blunt thing like that could not hope to withstand true, divine demonic power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Urrgghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Now, little mutt... It is time for you to play dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Bud!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Oh, dear. Are you feeling a little cornered?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Come, Mikaboshi. Unleash the corruption from this statue upon the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Once you do, demons will rule supreme!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>N-no...! We can't let this happen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Oh, but it will. Soon, Demon's Blood will spread like wildfire throughout the world, infecting every living being and turning them into demons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Ahhh, this air is so refreshing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power is...m-multiplying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I believe you call it a pantheon? With this corruption, we could easily create our own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>For now, we number but one hundred. Perhaps, for a time, we will roam the continent as a horde of demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Heeheehee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Oh, Yomi. You are looking quite black and blue...and red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>This is the end of Wadatsumi. The show—splendid as it has been—is done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>N-not...y-yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Now, Yomi, it is pointless to struggle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>W-Wadatsumi isn't...finished...yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I...have a p-promise...to keep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I am afraid you shall live to see them broken... Both Wadatsumi, and your little promise, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I'm s-still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>That is easily rectified!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>He was so good at spinning tops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Memories are flashing before my eyes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Spinning around and around inside my mind...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Like a merry-go-round.</td>
</tr>
