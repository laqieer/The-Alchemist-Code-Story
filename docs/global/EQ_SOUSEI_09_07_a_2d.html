<td>002</td>

<td>"I am Transcender of the Gate of Lust!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Okay, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Whoops. I may have struck that a bit too hard. Sorry about that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Y-you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Shall we continue where we left off?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Haa... Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Don't... Don't you understand?! If you keep doing this...you'll fall too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(Does she even know what she's saying?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It would hardly be my first time falling from the sky. Though I must admit, it hurts so much that death may be preferable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, I have no intention of finding that out for myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>"I am Transcender of the Gate of Lust!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Here's a little souvenir for you. Do enjoy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What? Why would you drop your shield?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I didn't drop it, I threw it. And that's not to say I don't have a use in mind for it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Gnrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(My body... It's... I can't move! Is this it for me?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hmm. If you were an average human, you'd definitely be dead by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ehh. I might as well finish you off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Nngh... Wa...gi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Honestly! Why is it that every time I'm gone, I come back to find you in the most dire possible situations?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Here, Adaleigh. You can see it, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Of course! Now, hold there, just like that. I've nearly got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You good to go, old dog?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes, though again I remind you, I am neither old nor a dog! Now, start the countdown, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>All right. You ready? Three...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Two...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>One... Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Got it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yep. Worked like a charm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Excellent! Then that's where we'll touch down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>How's Nimul?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Alive. No serious injuries. However, he seems to have lost the cores of the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh! That's not good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Incidentally, Waginau, where have you been all this time? You look, shall we say...different?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's a long story. Let's prioritize getting everyone back together first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yeah, that's probably a good call.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(He looks...older?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What? Is there something on my face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ah, no, it's... It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I suppose it stands to reason we couldn't get away quite that easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wh-whoa! What the heck was that?! Something flew into us from above!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Warning. Starboard engine damaged. Unable to maintain altitude. Prepare for emergency landing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Everyone hear that? Hang on tight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Nnggggggggggh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The dragon warriors, the serpents, that would consume this world are engaged in mortal combat with one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hey, uh, Shahel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>If my eyes don't deceive me, there's an airship about to crash-land right on top of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Uhhhh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Everyone, get behind me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Wh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Eeek?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Mira! Nyx!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hold steady, Daphne!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>But the two of them are—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Look. Beyond the smoke. Do you see it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>See what? I don't see—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>It's... Umm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Oops again! Broke something else. Why is everything in this era so fragile?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>But on the plus side, we seem to have landed in the middle of a battlefield, so I'll count this as a win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>That shield... No, it... It can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>My, my. You have the same shield as I! Are you an Invidian warrior yourself? How fortuitous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I am not quite as spiteful as Matia, but I am rather curious about the state of that which we've passed down for future generations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Ha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ngrk... The power behind that strike...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>It's not exactly enough to judge the entirety, of course, but you certainly did well to withstand my attack. Not a bad first impression.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Um... Thank you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You default to defense a bit too quickly. If you're perpetually on the defensive, it's only a matter of persistence to bleed your stamina dry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>What? Th-that's not true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. It is, after all, my role to attack, so I'm grateful for any advantage I'm given.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>You are a capable warrior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You aren't from around here, are you? We don't really call ourselves warriors much nowadays. We prefer to be called knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>All right. Have it your way. It matters not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>(What's her deal? She really does speak like she just stepped here directly out of the past. And moreover...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>(I'm absolutely certain my sword passed through her neck, but she doesn't show the slightest sign of injury!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Though I must say, by the standards of warriors, you are both fearsome indeed. I shall grant you a boon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I face you now with all of my strength. Come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Thanks, I guess. Are you ready, Daphne?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Yes. I don't think I could do this on my own, but I believe the two of us can take her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I was thinking the same. I'll leave the defensive side of things to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
