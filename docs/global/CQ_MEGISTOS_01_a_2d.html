<td>All that's left is this piece, but just how to modify it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Even if I were to weld it, there's still the problem of strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hey, Megistos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I guess it would be faster to weld it. But no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Seriously! Enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, it's you, Amis. What's the matter? I don't see you here often.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You're the matter. You took the expenses for your turret parts from the airship development budget, didn't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>According to the blueprint, this is the only model that makes sense. If only magic were an option...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hey, I'm talking over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...! That's it! Magic! Perfect timing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You can mold and modify things with magic, right? Try and make this piece for me. I can't do anything about it with the tools here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No, seriously, you came at the perfect moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I refuse. It's too much of a hassle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh? Why? Why do you refuse?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If I complete this, it'll be a revolutionary turret, you know?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Here, look at this blueprint! Right? It's amazing, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Like...I...was...saying...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>As Director of the Department of Technological Development, I came here to reprimand you for using the budget without permission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Why on earth would I end up having to help you instead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You're the one who doesn't understand just how great this turret is! How can you also call yourself a technician?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What I want is for you to make other things to do with airship development other than just turrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Sigh... You don't get it, do you? Try to think of thinks more calmly and objectively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Look who's talking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>All right. Watch how I fight next time. Then you'll feel more inclined to cooperate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Let's go, baby girls!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hey, hold on, wait! I still haven't finished talking with you!</td>
