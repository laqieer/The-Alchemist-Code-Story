<td>Isidore... How is Malta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The military doctor said that she is fine, physically. It's just that she has not regained consciousness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I will be joining the other troops in battle as part of the rear guard. Take care of Malta for me, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wait! What?! Why are you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Liberation Army stuck their necks out for our people. It would be churlish of me to let them take all of the heat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why must it be you? If anyone should stay behind, it should be me! It's my duty to our people as the next Chief of the Sephira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Kamui, I have always known. I always knew how you and Malta felt about each other... I did. I always...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Isidore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Let me die here. This is my place. The only one who can save Malta's heart is you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Isidore, you don't understand. I have no intention of dying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Look at you, Isidore. Do you really plan to go to battle in such a battered state? Of the two of us, I have more strength to spare. I will survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You think I will just believe you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>At the end, Waginau said to me, "This will be a troubled time for the Sephira."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You are the next in line to be Chief. You have a responsibility to our people to live on and protect them through the coming days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Kamui, but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But...I have no right to lead our people. I... Chief Iakov...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Look at me, Isidore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Kamui...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see that you have been struggling with something all on your own, something heavy. I am sorry that there is no time for me to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We must live on, Isidore. We must live on, all of us...so that we might one day return to our home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Be strong, Isidore. We will need your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I know nothing of leading people. You are the only one the Chief taught to bear such a burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The journey our people must undertake to outrun our enemies will be long and arduous. I'm sure that our people will need the lessons he taught you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You might be right, however—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Allow me to fulfill my duty, Isidore. You must lead the Sephira now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You... Iakov said the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I promise you that I will survive and return, Isidore. Let me know when Malta wakes up, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What? Kamui! Kamui, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You don't want to say your goodbyes to Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Um... It seems like he's kinda busy right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>A-and I'm sure he'll be fine. He's Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well, I guess this is goodbye, then, Hisham. I'll be joining the rear guard as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No, but y-you're really strong, Teona. You and Kamui, you'll definitely survive and...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, Hisham...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What's with that?! You're supposed to promise that we'll meet again soon! Even if it's a lie! You can't even give me false comfort?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So many people have already died! So many, and yet more will die today and tomorrow, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Nnn... Wh-why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I-I'm so sorry, Hisham. I'm so sorry that we adults weren't able to create a better world for you. I'm so, so...sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>No... Why...? This isn't fair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Looks like we're ready. Thank you, everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>All of us here are united in one goal: To fight to protect the backs of our fellows! We are here to give them a chance to pave a new world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>For many of us here, this will be our very last stand. Perhaps we are the cowards. We shall escape the humiliation of trying to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>However, take heart in the fact that our sacrifice here means saving the lives of our friends and loved ones!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>We fight! We fight to live! We must live on, even if not all of us can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huzzah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Kamui... Good luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes. We cannot afford to fail. We must do what we can to give Malta and the others a chance to escape!</td>
