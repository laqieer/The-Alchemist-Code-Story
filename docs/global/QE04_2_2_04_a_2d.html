<td>Kakkakka! Sorry, I got caught up in gazing at the moon's beauty. Don't you think it's beautiful?</td>
</tr>

<td>You know what a moonlit sky like this calls for? Wine! You wouldn't happen to have any wine on you by any chance, Fuu? Ah, that's right. You don't drink.</td>

<td>Alia</td>
<td>Sacred Stones...they can cause one to go mad. Just look at the recent Lion Monarch's Charge...now that's a perfect example. You never know who and when someone may be after it.</td>

<td>Kakkakka! If something were to happen, it would've been enough for the people of Saga to direct their blame and hatred towards an old decrepit like me.</td>

<tr>
<td>Alia</td>
<td>Kakkakka! I'm quite serious myself. Wine always tastes best on a moonlit night like this. Wouldn't you agree, Fuu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/hoo.png" alt="Fuu" height="128"><br>Fuu</td>
<td>Enough! You're not the only one who is shouldering the weight of Saga's future.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Alia</td>
<td>If it were to go on a rampage, it has the power to engulf not only Saga...but the entire world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Alia</td>
<td>It was my blunder that led to them learning of Beelzebub's whereabouts...thus, I'll take full responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Alia</td>
<td>I broke the law of Saga and brought about a crisis in the land...I, the Wind Sprite.</td>
