<td>What exactly happened on the night of Alia's purging?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...The moon was noticeably large on that night Alia summoned me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Alia summoned you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes. He summoned me, yet remained silent when I went to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>How about you say something? You were the one who called me here, Alia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Kakkakka! Sorry, I got caught up in gazing at the moon's beauty. Don't you think it's beautiful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You know what a moonlit sky like this calls for? Wine! You wouldn't happen to have any wine on you by any chance, Fuu? Ah, that's right. You don't drink.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Why didn't you say anything about Beelzebub?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Come now. Why would I place such a heavy burden on a youngster like you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Can you be serious for a moment?! I know you understand the gravity of the situation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm always serious. You just get a little too worked up. Come on. Relax those shoulders of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Alia! Enough...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Sacred Stones...they can cause one to go mad. Just look at the recent Lion Monarch's Charge...now that's a perfect example. You never know who and when someone may be after it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...! You could've told us. You didn't have to shoulder the burden alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Kakkakka! If something were to happen, it would've been enough for the people of Saga to direct their blame and hatred towards an old decrepit like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's not what I mean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If you had relied on us more, we could've done something about it sooner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Would you have been able to reduce the damage caused by the Veda Templars? ...Ah, look. A shooting star.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Alia! I'm being serious with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Kakkakka! I'm quite serious myself. Wine always tastes best on a moonlit night like this. Wouldn't you agree, Fuu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Enough! You're not the only one who is shouldering the weight of Saga's future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's why...you should've relied on us more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I find your words reassuring. You give me confidence that I can leave the rest to you when I'm gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Alia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Enough, Fuu! You must face reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You underestimate the power of Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If it were to go on a rampage, it has the power to engulf not only Saga...but the entire world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It was my blunder that led to them learning of Beelzebub's whereabouts...thus, I'll take full responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I broke the law of Saga and brought about a crisis in the land...I, the Wind Sprite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I doubt there's anyone who'd hold a single mistake you made against you. You've saved Saga countless times!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Someone must pay the price for Saga to be restored to its old ways of life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Pay the price...? What do you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Kakkakkakka! I want you to see me off, Fuu.</td>
