<td>The Divine Protector is no more, Chief. Siegfried and I buried it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You have done well, Soren. What happened was beyond your control. Perhaps we are no longer worthy of divine protection...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Were we not devout enough? We perform the ritual every year...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(This probably isn't the best time to tell them about Alchemy...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...But it may also be a positive sign. That it is time for us to take matters into our own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We've relied on our Divine Protector for too long... when the raiders attacked, we were at a complete loss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's only thanks to Siegfried here that we were able to successfully drive them out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Nothing to it. It's my way of repaying you and the village's kindness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>All that said... without the Divine Protector, I am no longer a Speaker. I'm not sure what I can do for the village now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Then it's time for you to leave and see the world. You've been here far too long, Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Haha. You mentioned you were a traveller, Siegfried. Would you do us one last favor and take Soren with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There's no doubt he has special talents. I'd like for him to look beyond this little village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Uh... I don't know if I can take care of a kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He's shy, but he'll learn. Especially from a man like you! Haha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Haha... ha... (What did I get myself into?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Siegfried... can I come along, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(I want to find out more about this power I have. What Siegfried called 'Alchemy'.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(Maybe then... I'll find out more about myself and why I'm here.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well... I do want to track down the perpetrator. The raiders were reporting to someone. Leaving you alone here might not be a good idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Guess I don't have a choice, huh?</td>
