<td>Bertrand, you took a while. What were you and Lord Gabirond talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Nothing...heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What is it? What's funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I was remembering my son.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>How he would've been a strapping young man like you are now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...If he were still alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>He died?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes. He was killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's embarrassing to say this now, but there was a period where I turned my back on the Alchemist Code.</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Driven by a desire for revenge, I lived quite similarly to the way you do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My life consisted of looking for my son's killer and tirelessly fighting in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wearing the mask of justice, I eagerly awaited the day I would be able to kill him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>However, a certain knight who I met on the battlefield at that time saw beneath my mask.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That was your father Captain Zeke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>My father?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Captain Zeke admonished me quietly, asked me whether I could look my son in the eye if he were here now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>He told me that my son would have wanted to see his father as an honorable and proud knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I had thought I had lost all emotions, but the tears began to spill from my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I was on the verge of losing myself and Captain Zeke saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There is no future when you hold on to revenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Mark my words... With hatred in your heart, you will only end up bringing sorrow to others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You cannot be an honorable and proud knight if you discard your humanity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Bertrand...</td>
