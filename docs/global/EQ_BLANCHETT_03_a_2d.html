<td>...! We've managed to penetrate the barrier! Let's head to the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I won't let you escape! You people who have drenched yourselves in Alchemy and have strayed from the path of man. It's time for you to stop and pay the price...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Aghh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(I won't make it at this rate?! More importantly, I can't die in a place like this...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(No, I need to protect Blanchett and the others. I need to deliver this message to Neville!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(No matter what, I'm going to survive this land of the dead!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>At least die like a warrior!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huff...huff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No, I can't run...anymore...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I sprained my leg... Leave me here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You can't give up here! You're going to become a soldier, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Besides, we're still alive. Every second, every minute is time that the director and the others are buying for us! We can't afford to stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...! Arghh! I-I'm not gonna lose! Here, I'll lend you my shoulder so stand up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>O-okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Chase them! Our orders are to not leave a single child! Search through the grass from root to root!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Th-their voices are close...what should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'll stop them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh?! What can you do on your own?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If I use the trees as a shield, I can run about for a while. There's no other way left, is there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh, besides...that voice sounds really familiar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh? Blanc?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's the sound of the bloodthirsty and unassuming breathing of a wolf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>H-hey! Blanchett!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Tsk! I can't believe we're chasing children through the mountains. What a hassle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't say that. We can't leave any witnesses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, if we can hunt down people without following military rules, then I have no complaint...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>There's one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What...! An enemy?! No, a child?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes, I thought so. You are wolves, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I can tell by your smell. You've bathed in too much blood. You smell like rotten beasts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I've gotta get rid of such bad wolves like you!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ack...she's fast! Don't underestimate the child! Surround her and eliminate all routes of escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Mr. Wolf, Mr. Wolf, everything that you did to everyone...I'll repay it all back in full!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>She moves a lot, but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...?! Let me go...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>When we catch her like this, she can't wave those blades of hers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Aghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Finally, you stopped. I would've preferred to have captured you alive, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You're dangerous. I'm sorry, but you'll have to die here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(Me, die? Here? Killed by the Wolf like my mother and father were...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>No...no, no, no! I can't die yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The other children aren't safe! I still haven't finished my revenge! And also...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I still haven't said goodbye to Freed yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wh-what the...?! This light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...Huh? Freed's charm stone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh, what a relief. Are you okay, Blanchett?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Fre...ed? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ah. Couldn't let you go without saying goodbye, could I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wh-what is this?! I don't know what's going on, but get out of the way, fiend! Men, attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hey, can you stand up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Um, yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Tonight's a really good night. That's why, well...are they your wolves? Maybe we should quiet them a little.</td>
