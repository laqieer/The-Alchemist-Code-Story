<td>It's Ejitan's helmet, aye. I couldn't bring myself to leave it behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Allie...</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Now isn't the time to be feeling depressed. For his sake as well, we...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I know, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's the role of the living to give meaning to Ejitan's death! I won't let it go to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Heh... That's the spirit. Don't worry; his spirit continues to live on in our hearts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>More importantly, what're we gonna do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>From what I recall, Big Bridge Station is the terminal station further past Redington City.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>There's no way we'll make it in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, we'll manage somehow. You don't have to worry about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh? What's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ronnie, don't take this the wrong way. I'm gonna leave you around here where it's safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What do you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Exactly what I said. Listen, Ronnie...I'm letting you off around here. You're gonna go back to Real Heaven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wh-wh-why?! Why just me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Because you're still a kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Guaranteed that there are even greater dangers waiting ahead of us. I can't bring a kid like you into that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Y-y-you gotta be kidding!!! Are you gonna just leave me behind?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If it's so dangerous, what about Miss Elester?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'd like to leave the little lady behind as well, but she might be the decisive factor in our search for the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I...I agree. We can't let you get involved any further in our problems...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You gotta be kidding!!! Seriously! There's no way I'm going along with that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No way I'm gonna let you just get rid of me!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Squeak...! Guard Droids approaching, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Tsk... We'll talk later. Let's hurry on ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Tsk... You gotta be kidding me!</td>

<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>All right...you should be safe here, Ronnie.</td>

<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hey, hey. Come on now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Before...you said I was a lady, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh? What's going on all of a sudden? Of course you're a lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Then you can't leave me behind. Doesn't it go against your character to refuse a lady's request?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Doesn't it contradict your policy to tread on my determination to follow you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm gonna follow you no matter what happens! Even if you leave me behind, I'll chase after you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Tsk. Once you get started, you never listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Does that mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I give up. We can't afford to waste time here. Let's buy some food for the road and get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>All right! You had me worried there for a second!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Right! Around here, there's a place that's famous for its sardine oil bagels!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Sounds good. Think you can get some?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...All right, let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huh? But what about Ronnie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>From here onwards, the Beckrams are gonna double down on us. It's for her own safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It's for Ronnie's own good. It can't be helped, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You're right. I'm sorry, Ronnie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Sorry! They were out of sardine oil bagels, so I got...huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>No way... Are they serious?! You've gotta be kidding me! Those morons!!!</td>
