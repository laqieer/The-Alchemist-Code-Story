<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Good! That's the way to do it. There's really not much else I can teach you, quite honestly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That's not true! I still have so much to learn from you! I'm nowhere near what I could be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm still...just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What's the matter? Is something troubling you? You know you can speak to me about anything, Lamia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well... There is one thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I feel terrible. I stepped on a flower the other day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I knew it was there, but I was careless, and I just couldn't maneuver around it in time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Flowers can't choose where they bloom, but we choose to fight where they do, and then...they get trampled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It is very like you to fret over such a thing, Lamia. Like you, and no one else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And I'm afraid I have no skills to impart upon you that would provide any aid in this matter. Even I cannot run through a battlefield without treading upon the flora therein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I suppose there isn't much to be done about it, is there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I think it is important, however, to remember the pain you feel from this. Remember it, carry it with you, and do your best to fight on despite it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes. Yes, of course! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's just one more reason to stop the fighting: so the flowers blooming in the fields need not be trampled any more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Precisely. So long as we share this goal, we will always be together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Exactly what I said. Even if we should fight on different fronts far removed, so long as we're working toward the same goal, we will always be fighting by one another's side in spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Lamia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No. No, there's no need to apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You're doing what you have to do. Something so important, it's worth leaving the knighthood for, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's thanks to you that I can. You keep me grounded. When I gaze upon a flower out in the field, then and only then does every trace of conflict and animosity simply vanish from my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The thought of peace never even crossed my mind until you brought flowers into my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Master?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Tell me. Do you hate war?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Even if I do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I see. Indeed, such research may be just the thing I need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>However, you say the Ruinmaker of Wratharis is going around burning it all up? If so, then we must gather whatever archives remain before she gets to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The issue is, the whereabouts of the extant data have not yet been confirmed. We are searching far and wide, but at this rate, she'll surely reach most of the stores before we do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We must execute our search in secret, you see. Should we not keep to the shadows, we'll attract unwanted attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hmph. How droll.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Then we'll just have to capture this Ruinmaker and...interrogate her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If necessary, we can even send troops into Wratharis to get the job done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Is such a thing...feasible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Of course! His Majesty's attention is elsewhere, at the moment. Now is the time to do as we please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Just remember, whenever you're searching for something, it's always best to clear away the refuse in the room first, so it doesn't get in the way...</td>
