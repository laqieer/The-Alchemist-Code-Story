<td>Hah!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(There are too many of them! I'd like to try taking them all down at once with Kagutsuchi...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(...but with all this chaos, I'd just end up catching the two of them in the blast. I'll have to be more deliberate with my strikes.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Nothing's going to stand in our way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hyahh!!!<br>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Waaaaah! What was that? What did I just do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What in the world...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Mikaboshi! Is that...ink?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't know what it is, but I can do it again, so it was no fluke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Maybe this is one more power I've been gifted to help return Wadatsumi back to the way it used to be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Back to how it should be.<br>Oh, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Mikaboshi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I have an idea! Sumeragi, follow my lead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Uh, o-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hyaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Grragh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Sumeragi! Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, that sure did the trick! And in one fell swoop, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Okay. But what actually was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The things you were saying earlier about restoring Wadatsumi back to what used to be normal just randomly popped into my head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It was kind of a gamble, but I thought maybe I could control that ink and shape it into a representation of that future. Figured it might work as a new technique, and I guess I was right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I even came up with a name for it: Beast Art Evocation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ugh, this is so unfair. You keep hogging all the glory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I can't help it! It just kind of happened. And it came out of our shared dream for Wadatsumi's future, anyway, so just shut your mouth and be glad I'm on your side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Sadly, there doesn't seem to be much choice right now but to kill or be killed when facing demons like that. But I'm hoping that with a little work, we can get by just incapacitating them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's the kind of future you were thinking of when you did that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yeah, basically. It was almost like praying for a miracle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You really are a kind soul, Mikaboshi, you know that? I don't think I'll ever be that nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well, I am the older twin. That makes me wiser, too, probably. Make sure you don't forget that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Haha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Pff...hahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>They say children grow up fast, but I don't think I've ever seen any others grow quite as fast as you two. It almost boggles the mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That ink technique you used, Mikaboshi? Kaede used it too, once upon a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Really? Mother did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Absorbing her horn may have triggered a physical reaction in your body, like unlocking a muscle memory or something. At least...that's the best theory I've got.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Showoff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No pouting now, Sumeragi. You've inherited Koga's fierce resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The two of you really are just like them. The resemblance is uncanny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But it's you who raised us, Lady Mitsuha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We wouldn't be where we are today without you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We're all in this together, right? No long faces allowed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There's still so much left to be done, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No kidding. But we're on our way, and that's what counts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Time passed quickly, and we continued our covert search for the origin of the malice that had settled upon Wadatsumi. It was definitely slow going, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Oh, it's you. Nothin' but bad news these days, eh? There's a rumor goin' around that says you lost your parents. Is that why I always see you skulkin' about by your lonesome?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Sorry, I don't mean to pry. Such a shame, though. Ain't nobody been spared from a loss or two these days. Heck, won't be long till the demons reach us here, I reckon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The powers that be won't do nothin' for us, neither. And to top it off, I hear them foul demon spawn they been keepin' in the castle have gone and run off, too! Bad tidings all around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I tell you, there might be somethin' to them rumors about the authorities conspirin' with demons, and even bringin' more of 'em in. Just a matter of time before they get us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But look at that, I went and talked your ear off! Here you go—I tossed a little extra in there for ya. Just let me know if you need any help, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>We—or, in this case, Sumeragi—learned that if we hid our identity, everyone would be kind to us. It really drove home that we were fighting malice on behalf of these people, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>As the days wore on, my eye continued to seek out demons with malice in their hearts, and Sumeragi's blade continued to cut them down, one after another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It's almost as if we were possessed by the Eye and the Blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>And we would continue to welcome that possession until the day we managed to cull the demon named Malice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It helped that there weren't just two of us anymore, but three.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>And hopefully, at some point, there would be even more. Hopefully one day our ranks would include everyone—all of humankind and demonkind alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That vision of the future is what kept us going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Until one fateful day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Soup's on! Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Shh! Do you hear that? Sounds like a large group of people by the entrance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You're right. I wonder if something's going on outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Here they are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Oh, this isn't good...</td>
</tr>
