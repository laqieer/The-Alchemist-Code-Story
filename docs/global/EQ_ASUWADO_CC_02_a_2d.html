<td>Whoa, look at this! I've never seen anything like it before! Hey, Mister, what is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh, that? It's fruit imported from Envylia. Fancy a sample to taste?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Could I? Why, thank you! Let's see, now... Mmm, it's so sweet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hahaha! Delicious, ain't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It certainly is! Though perhaps it's the air that's even sweeter. I'd swear the market's much livelier than usual. Did something happen to boost its fortunes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sure did. Desert Wings opened up a trade route to Envylia, and business is boomin'!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Far fewer children goin' hungry, too, as a result. Good time to be a merchant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Children...going hungry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, yeah. Not too long ago, this place was rife with orphans beggin' for scraps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Parents runnin' into hard times and abandonin' their kids, you know? Lots of 'em got into trouble, and you sometimes even saw 'em pass away in the streets. Real sad sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's terrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Fortunately, we don't see that so much no more. More children are doin' just fine these days. Like those kids playin' over there, for example.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>C'mon, c'mon! Over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Heeeey! Wait up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>They certainly do look happy. Everyone around here does, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>And we owe it all to them Desert Wings. Their guild captain's really somethin' else! Word is, he was an orphan raised on the streets himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well, thanks for filling me in, my good man. I'll stop by again, to be sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Just as I expected of you, Lady Najâ€”I mean, Aswald! You play the sweet young villager-next-door so well, I almost believed it myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Are you teasing me? I just did what I had to in order to gather the intelligence we need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>In any case, our target should be arriving very soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Mrrraaaah... I'm pooped!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Please, Master Ryle! Try to maintain composure! You're the one who insisted on coming here for observation, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That you, Ryle? You barely ever come all the way out here. Where's the fire?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I just thought I'd pop my head in and see how things have been going. How are sales these days?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ehh, sure can't complain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Desert products are a hot commodity in Envylia. Job's really starting to pay off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Good to hear, good to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>There's been some talk, however, of bandits on the trade route. Heard anything about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yeah, there've been a lot of them lately. But the guild defense has been dialing up the heat, so most people seem to think they're nothing to worry about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>And we have you to thank for that, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>As long as everything's okay. I'm glad you all seem to be getting along well enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The merchants really do trust the Desert Wings, don't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>They trust them because they've brought real change to the market. Which they definitely have, make no mistake. Nonetheless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmm? What are you looking at? Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Gentrification. Build up an area for one group, and you'll surely be pushing another out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>There's no quick fix for the world's problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Those born in darkness can only live in darkness. That's the way it's always been, and the way it'll always be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And that's why Zalam Gaim exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You lot seem to be real busy lately, huh? Anything I should know about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We've got a fairly important deal in the works. A number of our own are en route now to take care of it. Preparing the logistics of it all has been quite the chore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You aren't going yourselves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We've got some other guild work to take care of...unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Sounds like they're short on guild members at the moment. This might be our chance, Lady Najam!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Don't be so sure. That man is a slippery one. He's likely got some kind of trick up his sleeve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Suppose he already knows there's a hit out on him, for example. He may be baiting us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh. I hadn't thought of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Still, if he's at least telling the truth about staying put for the time being, it is a good opportunity to get this job done sooner rather than later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(Even if he knows we're poised to strike, we can account for that. As long as he dies in the end, that's all that matters.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Let's monitor the situation just a bit longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Eeek! Bandits! Bandits!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>So, the rumors are true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You guys stow away in the carts, and leave the fighting to us. Let's go, Carla!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Right! Don't worry, everyone; we'll keep you and all your goods safe!</td>
</tr>
