<td>Eek!</td>

<td>Um... Well... Er... You see...</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Aaah! You're so annoying! That shy attitude of yours, I don't like it at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Thank you for saving me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I-I...always wanted to thank you, but I didn't have the courage.</td>

<td>I wasn't trying to save you, you know!</td>

<td>I just couldn't stand that slimeball's guts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I just wanted to thank you...no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You're sure you don't want to go home? You've got one, right? Somewhere to go back to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No. I don't want to go back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Why not?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Because! If there's someone out there wanting to take my power...then they'll hurt gramps and nana to get it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh? What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This is Woody.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Did that doll just move?!</td>

<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Bunnies, you can come out, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Whoa...</td>

<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This is my power.</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You're...</td>

<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Just like me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So pretty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ila, they're so pretty! Hey, um... Can I see it again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You think they're...pretty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yep! Woody, you want to see it again too, don't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>He-hey, hang on a sec! This isn't an exhibit, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What? Oh, but I wanted to see them again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Tch. Scram already!</td>

<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wait up, Ila!</td>

<tr>

<tr>

<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We're back...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Welcome back, Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm glad to see you're safe. Did you find anything new?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I was wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>My apologies, Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Now's not the time for apologies. Scour the land; investigate any leads thoroughly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There's a hoard of Philosopher's Stones somewhere. Split into groups and find it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Where is Letitia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>She's underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What's wrong, Spica? You look down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I failed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Lord Zahar said he was wrong just now, didn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Yeah... A lot of other stuff happened, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I see... Huh? What's that you've got there? Is that a squirrel ornament? Why's it missing its tail, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Lord Zahar...gave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What?! You got it from Lord Zahar?! That's great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yeah, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>But...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It feels like Lord Zahar's going to drift some place far away...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>He's got to. He wants to destroy the current status quo in the world and create a completely new one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>He'll have to do some harsh things, and do some even scarier things to reach that goal. He's said it before, hasn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You can't replace the status quo unless you're prepared to tear the world asunder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I get that... At least, my brain does, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Spica, if you ever decide to leave Shadow Messiah, I'm coming with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What? I'd never leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I'm going to protect you, so all you need to do is keep chasing Lord Zahar, full speed ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Silma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You love Lord Zahar, don't you? You made the decision to come here, so you could help him, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>The world Lord Zahar wants to build will have a brighter future than any we could've ever had in this one. We've got to help him in any way we can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yeah, you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>It doesn't look like it worked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>No, what about this one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>We still don't have enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>It seems we'll need an absurd amount of Philosopher's Stones and alchemy to create a Sacred Darkstone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>How many decades would that take us? Despite our longer lifespans as elves, would we even be able to accomplish it in our lifetime?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Hmm... Our only realistic option would be to enter into that Contract with Darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>However, the price for any power gained through such a contract would be...steep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Nor would it give us the everlasting power we seek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Indeed. We continue gathering the Philosopher's Stones and creating the Sacred Darkstone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>As you command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>We need to increase our numbers. Have Corvus find us some new blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What would you like done with Mia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Nothing. We let her decide what she wants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>However, if we let her continue to abide with us, she will grow to be another seed who inherits our will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Leave her be for the time being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>You look a little tired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I feel fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You don't have to hold back for my sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>It's not time yet, my dear sister. I still need you by my side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>No, you don't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Do it. Drink up my dark elf blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Are you anxious that my half-elf body will not hold?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>We have no idea what will become of a half-elf like you who has become a dark elf. This is all I can offer you for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Thank you for your concern, my dear sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Mmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>What have I just seen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Letitia, Spica just dashed off somewhere. Did something happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I wouldn't know... Was that all you wanted to ask me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>No, my disciple has something to discuss with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Letitia, what are you going to do about Mia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Send her home, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Does she want to go home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>No. She says she doesn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Then, no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>It is Lord Zahar's wishes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Don't tell me you plan on making her one of your test subjects, just like that researcher did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>No. I have no such intentions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>But you're continuing his research!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>He simply had the wrong approach, and unlike him, Lord Zahar would never conduct such inhuman experiments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Butâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Ila....</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Do you not trust Lord Zahar's judgment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>No, I trust him... 'Course I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Then obey his wishes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Ila, leave it already. I'll talk to Lord Zahar about it. You don't have to worry about Mia anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>There's no point confronting Letitia. She thinks of no one else except Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I'm fond of Lord Zahar, too. I want to help him for saving me, but I really can't stand Letitia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Report for Lord Zahar! We have located a massive Philosopher's Stone, which we believe to be a natural phenomenon, in the Woods of Mystical Nights!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Splendid news.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Lord Zahar, allow me to go in your stead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>No, I'll go personally. Ila, Spica, and Silma may accompany me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>The Holy Order must already have their sights on a Philosopher's Stone of that magnitude. We leave immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Um, Lord Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>What is it, Ila?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Uh... Where...is Letitia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>I ordered her to guard our stronghold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Then...maybe...I should stay back, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Ila, have some faith in her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Do you hear me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Yessir...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Ila, you must trust us. We would never harm your friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Friend?! That's... That's not what I'm worried about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Hm. Ila, if you're that concerned for Mia, then the quicker we finish this, the quicker we get back. Understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>We're heading out now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>How are we supposed to find the Philosopher's Stone in the middle of this dense forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Fret not, Corvus. If the Philosopher's Stone is truly as large as the report stated, it should be releasing a fair amount of alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Ila.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Yes, Lord Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Release your alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>What? Are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Yes, go ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>All right, here we go then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Well? Do you sense anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Something's...calling me...from that direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>I see... You're using your alchemy to resonate with the stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Indeed. It wouldn't have worked had the stone been of the usual size. We'll head in that direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Phew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>We've come pretty far. Ila, are we still not there yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Hmm... I think we're getting closer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Ah, that way! We're almost theâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Grrrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>What's that noise?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>There's somethin' scary lyin' in wait here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>What do you mean by..."scary"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Aaaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>We're under attack! It's the Corpse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Are you kidding?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>An ambush?! That's cheating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Heh heh... All's fair in war. We've got you now, Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Lord Zahar! More are coming from this way, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>GRAAAAAAGH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Is this beast the "somethin' scary" from before?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Wait, Corvus. I can sense the Philosopher's Stone... I think it's coming from inside!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Don't tell meâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>You filth... You made the beast swallow it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Gahahaha! This is the end for you, Shadow Messiah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>GRAAAAAAAGHH!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Ugh! Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>G-go away.... Aaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>I'll come save you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Spica, pay the dead no mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Focus on defeating the enemy standing before you! Survive, at all costs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>O-okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>You're not leaving this place in one piece!</td>
