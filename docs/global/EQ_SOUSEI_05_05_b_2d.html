<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Whew, all done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...I still have no clue why you wanted to collect a bunch of sea creatures all of the sudden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, did you notice how little corruption there is in this area?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Fair enough, we haven't seen a single Fallen since coming here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It was similar in the Luxuria Belt, but that was just 'cause there weren't any people around, but that's not exactly the case here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This place is all totally thriving and prospering, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So I figured it must be something about this ocean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Now let's take a look at the results...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Bingo! I had a feeling it'd be something like this. The deeper down the creature lives, the worse the corruption is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So what does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It means that the source of the corruption in the Invidia Belt is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>A large source of sinful magil at the bottom of the ocean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Back in my village, we believed that running water can banish evil... I can't help but be reminded of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>According to my people, life is born on the surface of the water, while sin is swept by its currents and accumulates at the bottom of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That must be where our Leviathan is! The shrine must be at the bottom of the ocean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...How are we supposed to get there? Though I suppose we might not have to go... We did say we wouldn't kill the Cursed Beast this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hm, about that... Well, I guess diving would be impossible anyway. The airship's hull wasn't built to withstand that kind of water pressure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Not to mention it'd be hard to exit the ship and fight it, even if we did get there. Compared to the others, Leviathan will be a real tough nut to crack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We'll have to keep all that stuff in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You guys look like you're having fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh, Nimul. Sorry 'bout dumping this on you, but I'd like to hear your opinion too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Anytime, but first I have a favor to ask as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>A request?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes, I want you to think of a way to disable to magitek the Ira Belt knights were using.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hey there, little lady. You're looking awfully worried over there. What's up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Eek—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey now, what kinda response is that? You're going to hurt my feelings here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh, my apologies... I was simply lost in thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You really lack confidence this bad, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...H-huh? How did you come to that conclusion—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Anybody could tell. You've got a face on that's all 'I don't know why people are depending on me, so I'm feel very lost and worried about it".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ah, I'm not trying to insult you or anything, it's just that, you know—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It kinda looks like you're driving yourself into a corner here, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's, well, perhaps...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's simply that I don't understand. I don't think I could become someone like you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I think your resolve is incredible. You are prepared to bid farewell to the place you were born and raised, all for the sake of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I think that is truly what a knight should be like, but...I don't think that I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wait, hold up. I think we're dealing with a misunderstanding here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>All that stuff is just my own resolve! Knights, beliefs, justice, none of that's got anything to do with it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>E-excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>All that stuff was just me choosing my own answers! There's no need for you to imitate me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You should do things your own way. The right answer isn't going to fall down from the sky if you just wait for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You've gotta pick your own ideals, accept yourself, and figure out the right answer yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>An answer that you can be proud of. One that you can fight for without regrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I should...find my own answer...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yup. I'll admit that's a pretty arrogant way to think about things, but that's just another form of a knight's honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It's fine if you act a little more selfishly. If you want something, say it. If you want to scream, that's fine too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You can run away if you're scared and it's fine to fall to your knees if you're in despair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>But if you're scared, if you're suffering, and you don't want to give up? It's fine not to give up too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>When things get hairy, you should ask the people around you for help too. Especially me, I'm kind of super free all the time, so just give me a call and I'll come running.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That's... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Some food for thought, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yes, thank you. I will... I will take some time to think about what I want to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Then I can rest easy. Oh, by the way, you don't have to tell anyone when you reach a conclusion if you don't want to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Since secret vows are pretty cool too, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Haha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>His words calmed me down a little bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>At that time, I could've chosen to run away...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But my answer... The thing I want to protect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>If I can find my answer, I think I might just have a way to still these trembling hands of mine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Deliver your report...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Y-yes, sir! Thanks to the serpent's assistance, all ships are cleared to leave port!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>They did not notice our vanguard approach. We believe that our ambush will go swimmingly as well—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>No—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>No. No no no no no!! Forget about that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The enemy will notice! They will bare their fangs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Deploy all troops! We will trample their lands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Y-yes, sir! I'll tell all troops to set sail! We'll launch our attack at once—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Aaahh.... Andechs....! I will... I wiiiiiiill....!</td>
</tr>
