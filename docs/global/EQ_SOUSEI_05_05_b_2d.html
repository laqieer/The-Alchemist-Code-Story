<td>...H-huh? How did you come to that conclusion—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Anybody could tell. You've got a face on that's all 'I don't know why people are depending on me, so I'm feel very lost and worried about it".</td>

<td>That's, well, perhaps...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/daph.png" alt="Daphne" height="128"><br>Daphne</td>
<td>It's simply that I don't understand. I don't think I could become someone like you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/daph.png" alt="Daphne" height="128"><br>Daphne</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/daph.png" alt="Daphne" height="128"><br>Daphne</td>
<td>I think that is truly what a knight should be like, but...I don't think that I...</td>

<td>Wait, hold up. I think we're dealing with a misunderstanding here.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/daph.png" alt="Daphne" height="128"><br>Daphne</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>All that stuff is just my own resolve! Knights, beliefs, justice, none of that's got anything to do with it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/daph.png" alt="Daphne" height="128"><br>Daphne</td>
<td>E-excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>All that stuff was just me choosing my own answers! There's no need for you to imitate me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>You should do things your own way. The right answer isn't going to fall down from the sky if you just wait for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>You've gotta pick your own ideals, accept yourself, and figure out the right answer yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>An answer that you can be proud of. One that you can fight for without regrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/daph.png" alt="Daphne" height="128"><br>Daphne</td>
<td>I should...find my own answer...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Yup. I'll admit that's a pretty arrogant way to think about things, but that's just another form of a knight's honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>It's fine if you act a little more selfishly. If you want something, say it. If you want to scream, that's fine too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>You can run away if you're scared and it's fine to fall to your knees if you're in despair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>But if you're scared, if you're suffering, and you don't want to give up? It's fine not to give up too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>When things get hairy, you should ask the people around you for help too. Especially me, I'm kind of super free all the time, so just give me a call and I'll come running.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/daph.png" alt="Daphne" height="128"><br>Daphne</td>
<td>That's... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Some food for thought, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/daph.png" alt="Daphne" height="128"><br>Daphne</td>
<td>Yes, thank you. I will... I will take some time to think about what I want to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Then I can rest easy. Oh, by the way, you don't have to tell anyone when you reach a conclusion if you don't want to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Since secret vows are pretty cool too, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/daph.png" alt="Daphne" height="128"><br>Daphne</td>
<td>Haha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>His words calmed me down a little bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>At that time, I could've chosen to run away...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/daph.png" alt="Daphne" height="128"><br>Daphne</td>
<td>But my answer... The thing I want to protect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>If I can find my answer, I think I might just have a way to still these trembling hands of mine...</td>
