<td>001</td>
<td>(The Scarlet Flame Guard has been growing quickly of late. Ideally all of our members would have an iron will, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What's with that face, Gerald? If you keep it screwed up like that too long, it'll get stuck that way. Not a good look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ren. I didn't expect to see you here. You've already reported to Vettel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Of course. It's like you don't even trust me. Got some days off coming up now that I'm done with that, so I'm going home. Bye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Perfect timing. My own border patrols just finished. There's something I need to check on. You're coming with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Uh, excuse me? Did I not just tell you I was about to go on vacation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's an order from your Vice-Captain. Go and get ready. Now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm just saying, this seems like an abuse of authority...but fine! Why do you have to be like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You understand our mission, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't know, maybe you should tell me for the forty billionth time. That was sarcasm, Gerald, in case you couldn't tell. Please don't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We're headed to a city on the border of the Desert Zone to help defend them against attacks from a group of unsavory desert ruffians that have been particularly active recently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>On top of that, there are bandits living in the neighboring mountains. I think I got all that right. Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Personally I still think it'd be better to go ahead and crush the both of them instead of having to do something as meh as standing guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Our duty is to guard the city. Refrain from doing anything reckless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Roger... You never change, Gerald. Straight-laced as ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Not all of us can play fast and loose like you do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Gerald, check it out. I can see a village over there. Shall we take a break?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We haven't stopped since we left the royal capital. I suppose a short rest wouldn't hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>By the way, Gerald... Weird how few young people they've got here, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Now that you mention it... The only people around here are children and the elderly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I wonder what happened...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oho, there you are. My apologies for not saying hello earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You must be the mayor of this village... I must express my utmost gratitude for your hospitality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh no, it's nothing. The rumors of the honorable Scarlet Flame Guard have reached this village, you see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>And we would like to ask such powerful knights for help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>There is a swarm of monsters that has been attacking this village. I was hoping you might do us the favor of taking care of it for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What? I don't remember hearing anything about something like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>As you can probably tell, we are a poor village. We don't even have enough money to go to the royal capital to report the incidents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We've been trying to deal with it on our own, but one by one all the men in this village have... Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I see... So that's why there are no young men here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So you noticed. Indeed, all those who were capable of fighting have lost their lives for the sake of this village...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We have an urgent mission in the next city... Since it is an emergency, I'm afraid the Scarlet Flame Guard won't have time to attend to this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That is why I will handle this myself. Ren, you go ahead to the city with the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What? No way, Grumpface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm not letting you have all the fun! Besides, this unit is all people that you personally selected. They'll be fine without me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I suppose it's true that you're not originally part of this unit...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Plus, I can't let you stay here alone. Who's gonna do your work if you die here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You do know that you're kind of important in the Scarlet Flame Guard, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Don't be ridiculous. There is no one in the Scarlet Flame Guard that we could do without.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wait... Does that include me? That might be the nicest thing you've ever said to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Mayor, the two of us will be staying here to help you. I hope you find that acceptable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>O-of course! We would be much obliged!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Gerald... Did you just ignore me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hey, Gerald. If you were originally thinking about doing all this without me, why did you decide to bring me along?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This isn't the time. Here it comes. Get ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Aw, come on! Where's the love, Gerald? Do you not trust me or something? That's hurtful, my friend.</td>
</tr>
