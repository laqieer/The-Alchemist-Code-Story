<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>So what are you going to do next?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You told me you had unfinished business on the outside, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I can't imagine you meant just hiding out like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes... Actually, I have friends I want to meet up with, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I don't think that would be a good idea right now. I'm already being targeted, so I'd just end up putting the two of us in danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Besides, I don't even know where we are right now. It's like we're moving blindly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...Well whoever they are, it sounds like they're important to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>They are. They're my hope. The future of this world depends on their journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...Then how about a diversion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>A diversion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>There are ways you can help your friends from afar as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If you can attract Ophioneus' attention, that should take some heat off your friends, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And if they focus on me, that gets you what you want too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I understand what you mean, but how would I even go about doing that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We start a rebellion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...We what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? I've got an old acquaintance here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Knowing him, he'd jump at the chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well done, Carnet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Thanks to you, those filthy beasts will think twice before attacking our streets again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What a crap job. How about something a little more tasteful next time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh, I know, I know, my angel. But when I need something dead, I can always count on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It was only because I was shorthanded that I assigned you such a grubby task. I already have something much more extravagant in mind for your next job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>More extravagant?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes. The next target is…a dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>A dragon…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(He's avoiding trying to explain about it…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Sounds interesting. So what exactly is the plan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You can ask about it from this gentleman here. Right? You are…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm Shahel. Thank you very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Those who are dissatisfied with the present reign, those who doubt its benefits, and those who desire the benefits of strife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>They exist in any generation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If these people were brought together and formed one organization…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Even Ophioneus would have no choice but to act on a situation like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I see…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>In that sense, the Sloth Layer is very convenient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>A melting pot of all the worst parts of humanity, as I've explained before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's right. Actually…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>There are safety concerns around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But as long as there is human activity, there is a degree of law and order. Though…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>There is Big Heaven, the casino run by the extremely wealthy Aedith in the middle of Redington.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So taking control of that establishment means taking control of the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You're not thinking of raiding it, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I must ask, do you think I'm only capable of violence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>No, that's not what I meant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We'll discus it at some point, but the center of this town is that casino.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>So we need to take control of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That man Aedith is a hardcore gambler. If we lure him, he could be controlled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes, really. I bet my entire fortune and lost everything once before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It was after that the owner of the inn helped me out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'd like to ask you something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You're trying to say good things about this city, but it seems you just want revenge against the city taking your money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What are you saying, Schmeier? If you lose, it's only natural to fight and take back what is yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>So, let's go. We'll take this town and make Aedith suffer with embarrassment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hm… Looks like I made an odd choice for an ally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>H-hey, that girl…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It can't be. Matia? When did she come back to the city?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>All eyes are on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You're right. But why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>(She didn't cause a scene at the casino before, did she?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Is this seat taken?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It's you…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Didn't you say you retired from gambling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I remembered there was a little more left to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>So you're here to play for a bit? Seriously?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It's not like I'm a beginner around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I'll make sure you'll be left with nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Is that a dare?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Hm? Hmmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>(This is not what I was expecting…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>How the…? How is she doing this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Um, you think you'll win this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You have cards drawn, then the total sum of the numbers shown on the cards must be the closest to the target number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>So it's a game of chance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>It is, but it's not only about luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>It's also about when to pass and how far your opponent is willing to go. Strategy is important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>And like this…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I won again…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>This is just like what happened a decade ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>As for passing, how do you know when to do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>The opponent's intuition. I'm never wrong when reading their minds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Seems like a waste of your talent, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Oh, that's a bust for you, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Grr…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You're no match for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Could you call over the Casino's manager, Aedith?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Grr... Ugh... Dammit...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Seriously... don't bully the employees you used to work with, Matia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Aedith. So good to see you finally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>You're always bringing trouble with you. What is it this time? Money issues?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Well, I'll lend a hand. Alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>As always, you're a man with a good choice of words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>That's part of my job. That's how I got to the top. So, are you here to lose again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Is that what you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>No, as you're not a woman who looks toward death without a plan. I know that well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>After all, we're friends who have each other's backs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Your backs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Back in the days as a free mercenary, this guy was my partner of all things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>It seems you've brought a beautiful lady along with you. You're a dragon…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I assume that the reason why Matia is here is because of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Yes, I actually have a business meeting!.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Business meeting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Schmeier, what are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Well, I'm just not reckless to have my fate decided by gambling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>A fair deal would be much easier. Isn't that right, Aedith?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I see. You want something, so what are you willing to do for it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>What I want is land. I'd like a place where I can continue my research and without bother from others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>And in return, I'd like to offer my services to better everyone's lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Is that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>The development of this city is amazing! But because of rapid development, there are some things that have been unattended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>The structural integrity of roads and buildings. The upkeep of waterworks and sewage facilities. The development of distribution…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>There are many things to consider, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Of course. But we humans don't live as long and aren't as strong as you dragons are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>And Magil is not as well served as with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>So, what's the problem? The advantage of humankind is that we outnumber everything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Even in a disadvantageous environment or inconvenient situation, we can adapt to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>That's the spirit of the people of the Sloth Layer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>But isn't there something you'd like to be more convenient?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I can give you the ideas and technology to develop even further. Would that be a consideration?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Miss dragon. I'm sure that the dragons were skeptical about dragon technology falling into the hands of humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Only dragons should be using that tech, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Well, that is true. But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>You must have thought it was unreasonable too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I can see it within the city. Even this establishment is using dragon technology.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>The land was abandoned by the dragons. That is true…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>You're not thinking about dragonkind, but instead thinking about your own desires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Any dragon would find this offensive to see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>And you're different from them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Of course. My purpose is having a coexistence with you humans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>She's got quite a mouth…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>That's my honest thought. My goal is to have peace. And for that…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>In order for the dragons to continue to live, they need the "Shell of the World."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Sounds interesting. That really touched my soul, dragon girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Really? Then…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Really… It would've been so much nicer to have met you three days ago…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Huh…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>! Schmeier! Get down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>They're aiming at us…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>No, they aren't. But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>I can't see them… Are they after us, Aedith?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Personal brawls are forbidden in the casino. You were the one who decided that, remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Yes, exactly as you say, Matia. I'm just being irrational, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>My life is at stake here. And I'm not the only one. The lives of everyone on this floor as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>What…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>As you say, Lord Aedith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Schmeier the runaway… If you could kill her with your own hands…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Ophioneus will surely recognize the autonomy of this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>You're that high elf…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Yes. It's a pleasure to see you again, Schmeier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Lord Aedith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>I know. Go, Carnet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Schmeier, get behind me! First, we must figure out the sniper's position!</td>
</tr>
