<td>So we need to take control of it.</td>
</tr>

</tr>

<td>Schmeier, what are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Well, I'm just not reckless to have my fate decided by gambling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>A fair deal would be much easier. Isn't that right, Aedith?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>I see. You want something, so what are you willing to do for it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>What I want is land. I'd like a place where I can continue my research and without bother from others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>And in return, I'd like to offer my services to better everyone's lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Is that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>The development of this city is amazing! But because of rapid development, there are some things that have been unattended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>The structural integrity of roads and buildings. The upkeep of waterworks and sewage facilities. The development of distribution…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>There are many things to consider, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Of course. But we humans don't live as long and aren't as strong as you dragons are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>And Magil is not as well served as with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>So, what's the problem? The advantage of humankind is that we outnumber everything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Even in a disadvantageous environment or inconvenient situation, we can adapt to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>That's the spirit of the people of the Sloth Layer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>But isn't there something you'd like to be more convenient?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>I can give you the ideas and technology to develop even further. Would that be a consideration?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Miss dragon. I'm sure that the dragons were skeptical about dragon technology falling into the hands of humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Only dragons should be using that tech, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Well, that is true. But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>You must have thought it was unreasonable too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>I can see it within the city. Even this establishment is using dragon technology.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>The land was abandoned by the dragons. That is true…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>You're not thinking about dragonkind, but instead thinking about your own desires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Any dragon would find this offensive to see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>And you're different from them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Of course. My purpose is having a coexistence with you humans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/math.png" alt="Matia" height="128"><br>Matia</td>
<td>She's got quite a mouth…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>That's my honest thought. My goal is to have peace. And for that…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>In order for the dragons to continue to live, they need the "Shell of the World."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/math.png" alt="Matia" height="128"><br>Matia</td>
