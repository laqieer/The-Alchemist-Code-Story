<td>I wish...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I wish to be like you, Klima, someone who can protect the smiles of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I wish to be strong and help others as you do. I want to be strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I think that's very good. I give you an A+ for ambition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>From that day on, she was my special someone. She helped me and brought smiles to my face, rewarded my efforts with an A+.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Still, I could not tell this very special friend a very important feeling of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hm... This should do for party preparations. What do you think, Reimei?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What do I think? I don't know. Fine, I guess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Now all that remains is arranging the confectionery to be served at the party. Then I should review the guest list, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Dude! Looks like the party preparations are coming along real nice! Thanks for helping, you two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This ought to be a decent set up for all our shy male Phantom Soldiers. Right, Gino?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What are you looking at me for? I'm not shy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Come on, don't be like that. Think of it this way: this whole thing works in your favor, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Fraise told me. You've got something you want to give Moa, don't you? Some kind of apology present?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Fraise was really worried, knowing how shy you can be. So he wanted this party to be the perfect opportunity for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Th-that... I didn't ask him to do that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Reimei. You're here helping because you have a gift to give someone too, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What? No, I'm here because I was told that there'd be some rare treats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yeah, sure you are. I totally believe you! Just know that you don't have to hide your feelings. If you have them, I mean. Just saying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Okay...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This is interesting. If I may, I'd like to help in these endeavors as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Kevin, your desire to assist in another's display of gratitude is in some way akin to the spirit of hospitality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You see, hospitality is one of the fundamental tenets of being a butler. So, I do my best to make sure the party preparations continue efficiently and elegantly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Goodness! This is an A+ venue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Miss Plumeria. I'm sorry, but the party venue is not yet ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, yes! That's why I came!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Everybody here is prepping for the White Day party, correct? I wish to lend a hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But White Day is when the guys pamper the girls. Wouldn't it be kinda weird to have you help us set it up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I don't mind at all! I, like everybody here, wish for this party to do well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>N-no, what I mean is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I've been on the receiving end of hospitality at countless parties. For once, I'd like to be the one providing it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>And the idea that there'll be so many Phantom Soldiers in one place at once... I'm so very excited! Please, allow me to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Miss Plumeria, you were from a noble family of Wratharis, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes, but why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It is nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>So? What're we gonna do, Kevin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Uhm... I'm still not sure if we should make a girl prepare for—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wait just a minute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>M-Moa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I have something I'd like to say! Please let Plumeria assist with party preparations! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What am I doing here? I'm here to do my part as Love's Cupid, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The fact that she so earnestly wishes to lend a helping hand can only mean that there is some special incentive for her to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>A special incentive around this time of year... There can only be one thing! Love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Surely among those here is someone Plumeria secretly fancies! That is why she is so eager! I'm sure of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Come on, really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Don't worry, Plumeria! I am on your side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Thank you so very much, Moa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Kevin, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Oh, boy. There's no way I can turn two girls down at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But I'm going to be out inviting girls to this party. I just don't have the time to oversee you during prep time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It cannot be helped, then. I will take care of Miss Plumeria. Kevin, if you would focus your attention on escorting the guests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The preparations of this party are my jurisdiction. If she is to help, it is my instructions she ought to be listening to in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Thanks. I promise to be back as soon as I invite a decent number of people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>All right, then. Let us finish the remaining preparations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hmm?! I sense a couple unable open up to each other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>This will not do! I must go be their cupid savior!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Whoa, hey! Don't go running off on your own like that! You know you get yourself in trouble when you do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Huh. And just like that, our numbers are way down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yes, but there is no problem. With a venue of this size, it is actually more efficient this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Well, all right, if you say so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I'm excited to help! What can I do to begin with?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Let's see. Could you go purchase the confectionery we will be serving?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Absolutely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Ankh, Reimei, let's make this an A+ party!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Why is she so invested in helping with this party?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Who knows? It could simply be the errant whim of a noble with time on her hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I just didn't expect you to be so harsh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Did I come across that way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Oh. Well, that isn't good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Do I ever get upset?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Of course I do. I am only human, after all. I do feel irritation when things do not go my way, and I am perturbed by things I do not care for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Still, I do not ever let it show. That is the spirit of hospitality. One of the fundamental tenets of being a butler.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Hospitality requires compassion. It is a form of compassion to not force your personal emotions upon others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I pray you too will maintain your composure, Master Ankh. After all, you are of noble birth, destined to stand above others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Ankh? You all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I'm...fine. I was simply lost in thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>(Perhaps it is because she reminds me of how I used to be... Accustomed to being pampered and received always with gentle and generous hospitality.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>(I must stay calm. Maintain my spirit of hospitality. That is what a butler is supposed to do.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Now, let us begin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>The hell is this? A White Day party? What a load of crap!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>People being all frisky and lovey-dovey in public?! Bah! Pisses me off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Oh dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Hmph. What happened to compassion and hospitality and all that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I don't see what that has to do with pest management.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>My! It is starting to get quite lively, just like a festival! Everybody must be very excited for White Day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>You're all here for the party, yes? How wonderful! Who are you intending to invite?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>(It is frightening how innocence can keep one so oblivious.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Sh-shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Like hell we're looking forward to White Day! You have any idea how many chocolates I got on Valentine's?! None!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I ain't got a single person to celebrate White Day with!</td>
