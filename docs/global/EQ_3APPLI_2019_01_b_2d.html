<td>We've come so far! Don't you dare suggest that we stop now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm just saying, I don't think we should be risking the creation of parallel worlds for no good reason!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The beginning of this incident can be traced back to the age in which the continent of Babel first formed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How about a cook-off?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Mira... Sometimes your leaps in logic are impossible to follow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A cook-off! You know, a cooking competition? A chef's greatest weapon is the cuisine they serve up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I guess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Space-Time Manipulators like us employ space-time as our weapon, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Your point is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Those terrible, colossal creatures who ravage the land, threatening the entire world...the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Humankind waged an ages-long war against these beasts, wearing down our forces considerably.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Seeing this, Mira and I applied ourselves to our research, and labored to create a new style of space-time manipulation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We must go beyond Alchemy; beyond the bounds of space-time, past and future; beyond this very world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We will drag excellent warriors and potent military forces into our world. They will take care of the Cursed Beasts for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's a terrible plan! Time must be correctly maintained! We mustn't mess with it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>With things as they are, this world has no future. Time will come to a standstill. There will be no one to keep it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This is your idea of a last resort?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Failure is the mother of success—just like I'm your big sister!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>In other words, who cares if we fail, you're older than me and I should do what you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Let's just give it a try!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, if we're doing this, we're going to need...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>A grid, for one. That's configured and ready to go. A catalyst... I suppose we've got that covered, too. So, all that's left is for us to combine our powers and say the magic words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Adrift in the sea of time, the pendulum stirs the depths of the waves. Gather where the light falls, that I may see you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Sea floor and cerulean sky, woven and unfurled. Be it chance or be it fate, we are chased by dreams both infinite and finite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Now, come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Chance Encounter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We've done it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Does this mean...our attempted magic is incomplete, but it activated anyway on the impetus...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Drawing various individuals from their respective worlds and bringing them together, only to sweep them all ashore upon a heretofore mutually unfamiliar plane...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>H-huh? Tinnie, could you, um, cut to the chase?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Would you mind if I...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Not at all. Succinctly, if you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>None of this was foreseen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We don't even know how to make it home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We've really done it... Oh, boy, are we in trouble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This has got to be a nightmare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'd just finished a mission... I should be relaxing in a hot spring right about now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Instead, I'm being chased around by some kind of monster before I even know what's going on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Not to mention, I had a boy I've never even seen before crash into me... All while I was in the nude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I wish you were here to help me...Sakura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Next time, on Shinobi Nightmare—I mean, on "For Whose Princess Could Endure This Nightmare?"...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Do you know how I feel? Has my heart reached yours?</td>
