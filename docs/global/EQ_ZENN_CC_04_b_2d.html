<td>001</td>
<td>It was several years ago now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The first birthday I ever celebrated fell on a sunny day, just like this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You cannot erase your past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Be that as it may...I can't call myself D. Lily anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Why not? Yes, when we fled Greed Dike, you left Imperial Security behind you, and I abandoned my duties as shrine maiden. Now we are forging a new life here together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But that doesn't mean that you have to become an entirely new person. You can keep some of who you were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I betrayed my employer. I abandoned my subordinates. I fled in disgrace. I don't want to be that person anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If you feel guilty for those actions, isn't that even more reason to hold on to your old name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You mean you think it'd make me an even bigger disgrace to abandon that, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No one is going to forgive you for the wrongs you have committed. Murder, betrayal, treason...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>These aren't crimes that you can atone for. Not even in the afterlife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So, what do you do? You bear the burden, no matter how torturous. You shoulder these sins for as long as you live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>In time, it will get easier. Humans do, after all, heal naturally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Given enough time, we can even forget our guilt, and our penitence...but that is by no means a good thing. If you ask me, you should hold on to those feelings...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>And live out the rest of your life doing what you can to apologize for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I suppose this is why people seek companionship, or a place to call their own. We all need a receptacle in which to deposit our burdens when they grow too heavy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It could be a country, a friend, a home, or even a duty. Something or someone that provides us a means of resting our spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I no longer have any of those things. I abandoned them all when I left Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You have me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Y-you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You gave me a second chance at life. Nothing you or anyone else can say can change that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Did you know that there is more than one variety of daylily?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No, I didn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There is a bright-yellow variety grown in Wadatsumi known as the zehnteika.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's my favorite kind of daylily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Like all daylilies, it blooms and wilts within the span of a single day, but it continues to grow new flowers, day after day, littering the garden bed with spots of yellow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I've always liked the idea of filling my garden with zehnteika, the flower that is continually reborn, irrespective of place, circumstance, and the vicissitudes of life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>They would make for a beautiful addition to our home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Of course, they're not currently in bloom, but if we were to plant some seeds, we could see them as early as next year, and enjoy them forever after that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Why do I get the feeling we're not just talking about our garden, here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Because this is my alternative solution: a new name, with the same meaning. What do you think of Zehn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Zehn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I... I accept. I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Tut-tut. When you receive a gift, the proper thing is to express your gratitude, not apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>B-but I have nothing to give you in return!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I-I still haven't found you that bouncy ball.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, that? Don't be silly. It doesn't matter now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I... I actually did a little research into what that colorful ball means in Wadatsumi. It's connected to the New Year, isn't it? It's a toy enjoyed by children during that time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That's all true...except for one thing. You've already given me a gift. The greatest gift of all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wh-what? Y-you mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'm gonna be a...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hmhm. You know, the very first time I met you, I felt like your heart was reflected in your eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It was plain to me that you were...killing yourself, in a sense. It was hard to meet eyes so tortured, but...I wish I had been able to, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I remember feeling something similar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hmhm. Yet, here we are. Now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Now we can stare into each others' eyes forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We must not take our eyes off the enemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Heed me, beloved citizens of our proud nation! I will repeat this message as many times as it takes for it to sink in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The shrine maidens of Wadatsumi are the root of all evil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Is it any good, boss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Boss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>This dish is a favorite of mine, but I made it especially for you. Are you enjoying it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What's more, we have discovered that Wadatsumi has been covering up the rampant misuse of Alchemy perpetrated within its borders!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yes, they defy the Magna Code, the taboo acknowledged by the entire world, as if they alone are exempt from it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>This is not a matter to be taken lightly. We cannot forgive such atrocities on the principle of ignorance, when they are by nature unforgiveable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Come to think of it, you never told me what sort of dishes you enjoy, boss. Do you have a favorite?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Won't you tell me? I'm sure I can make it for you. Turns out, I'm as skilled as any gourmet chef.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It brings me great sorrow to report that one such incident has already occurred here in Greed Dike. A vile shrine maiden has employed her wicked rites to corrupt the mind of none other than the star of our nation, the father of Imperial Security himself... D. Lily!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>This tragedy has struck our military such a blow that I have been cowed into admitting my defeat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Why did you leave me behind, boss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>How to express my regret that I, who ought to be without weakness, have known such a loss? How to atone for the fact that the great pillar holding up our nation has suffered a devastating crack?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I have failed you, my citizens, and for this, I ask your forgiveness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Don't you care about me at all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Rest assured, action will be taken. But before we can bring the fires of war to Wadatsumi, we must first stabilize our national interests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I suppose that's an unfair question. I'm being petulant, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>As such, Imperial Security is henceforth abolished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>In these troubled times, I have greater need of faithful servants in whom I can fully place my trust than ever before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Of course you care about me. You must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>That is why, in place of the old Imperial Security, I will be forming a new organization: the Imperial Elite Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>How can I doubt that, after all those times I watched you enjoy my cooking so sincerely?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>And who shall lead this fledgling organization, my new Imperial Elite Guard? None other than my unswervingly loyal confidant, Na Zhu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>There can be no doubt. You wouldn't have left me if it wasn't for that demon shrine maiden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>She twisted you, didn't she? It would have been easy for a freakish occultist like that to warp someone's mind...even yours, boss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>We shall be working together to rebuild our military, establish order throughout the capital, and form a united national front. Once we have achieved all this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>We shall invade Wadatsumi! And when we strike, there is no one in this world who will be able to stop our advance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>But don't worry, boss. I'm coming for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Never again will I taste defeat, for we shall fight the coming battles together! As one, we will march on the very world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I'm going to open your eyes, and then...things will go back to the way they were.</td>
</tr>
