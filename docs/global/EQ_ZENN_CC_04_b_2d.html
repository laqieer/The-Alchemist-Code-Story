<td>It was several years ago now.</td>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>The first birthday I ever celebrated fell on a sunny day, just like this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>You cannot erase your past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>Be that as it may...I can't call myself D. Lily anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Why not? Yes, when we fled Greed Dike, you left Imperial Security behind you, and I abandoned my duties as shrine maiden. Now we are forging a new life here together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>But that doesn't mean that you have to become an entirely new person. You can keep some of who you were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>I betrayed my employer. I abandoned my subordinates. I fled in disgrace. I don't want to be that person anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>If you feel guilty for those actions, isn't that even more reason to hold on to your old name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>You mean you think it'd make me an even bigger disgrace to abandon that, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>No one is going to forgive you for the wrongs you have committed. Murder, betrayal, treason...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>These aren't crimes that you can atone for. Not even in the afterlife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>So, what do you do? You bear the burden, no matter how torturous. You shoulder these sins for as long as you live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>In time, it will get easier. Humans do, after all, heal naturally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Given enough time, we can even forget our guilt, and our penitence...but that is by no means a good thing. If you ask me, you should hold on to those feelings...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>And live out the rest of your life doing what you can to apologize for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>I suppose this is why people seek companionship, or a place to call their own. We all need a receptacle in which to deposit our burdens when they grow too heavy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>It could be a country, a friend, a home, or even a duty. Something or someone that provides us a means of resting our spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>I no longer have any of those things. I abandoned them all when I left Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>You have me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>Y-you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>You gave me a second chance at life. Nothing you or anyone else can say can change that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Did you know that there is more than one variety of daylily?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>No, I didn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>There is a bright-yellow variety grown in Wadatsumi known as the zehnteika.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>It's my favorite kind of daylily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Like all daylilies, it blooms and wilts within the span of a single day, but it continues to grow new flowers, day after day, littering the garden bed with spots of yellow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>I've always liked the idea of filling my garden with zehnteika, the flower that is continually reborn, irrespective of place, circumstance, and the vicissitudes of life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>They would make for a beautiful addition to our home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Of course, they're not currently in bloom, but if we were to plant some seeds, we could see them as early as next year, and enjoy them forever after that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>Why do I get the feeling we're not just talking about our garden, here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Because this is my alternative solution: a new name, with the same meaning. What do you think of Zehn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>Zehn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zenn.png" alt="Zehn" height="128"><br>Zehn</td>
<td>I... I accept. I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Tut-tut. When you receive a gift, the proper thing is to express your gratitude, not apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zenn.png" alt="Zehn" height="128"><br>Zehn</td>
<td>B-but I have nothing to give you in return!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zenn.png" alt="Zehn" height="128"><br>Zehn</td>
<td>I-I still haven't found you that bouncy ball.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Oh, that? Don't be silly. It doesn't matter now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zenn.png" alt="Zehn" height="128"><br>Zehn</td>
<td>I... I actually did a little research into what that colorful ball means in Wadatsumi. It's connected to the New Year, isn't it? It's a toy enjoyed by children during that time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>That's all true...except for one thing. You've already given me a gift. The greatest gift of all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zenn.png" alt="Zehn" height="128"><br>Zehn</td>
<td>Wh-what? Y-you mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zenn.png" alt="Zehn" height="128"><br>Zehn</td>
<td>I'm gonna be a...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Hmhm. You know, the very first time I met you, I felt like your heart was reflected in your eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>It was plain to me that you were...killing yourself, in a sense. It was hard to meet eyes so tortured, but...I wish I had been able to, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zenn.png" alt="Zehn" height="128"><br>Zehn</td>
<td>I remember feeling something similar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Hmhm. Yet, here we are. Now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zenn.png" alt="Zehn" height="128"><br>Zehn</td>
<td>Now we can stare into each others' eyes forever.</td>

<tr>

<td>Yes, they defy the Magna Code, the taboo acknowledged by the entire world, as if they alone are exempt from it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/orion.png" alt="Orion" height="128"><br>Orion</td>
<td>This is not a matter to be taken lightly. We cannot forgive such atrocities on the principle of ignorance, when they are by nature unforgiveable!</td>

<tr>
