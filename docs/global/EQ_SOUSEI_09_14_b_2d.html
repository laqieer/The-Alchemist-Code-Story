<td>I don't know your situation. I don't know what happened to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But I have my own reasons to fight, and I will not give in to anyone or anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Very well, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But I'm afraid you've already caused more than enough trouble, successor of the Shield. Though I do thank you for bearing its legacy well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And with that...my oath is fulfilled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Haaa...haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>All right! Nice work, Daphne! You totally pulled it off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I suppose. But she was already exhausted from her prior battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>C'mon, a win's a win! Now let's hurry back to Nyx and the others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Whoa! Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I think so. I used up all of my magil in that battle. The protection from the Alchemy is gone, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hmm. In that case, how about you rest here for a moment? I'm worried about Nyx, so I'llâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What the...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>First line, fall back! But be sure not to leave any gaps in the magil barrier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And leave those corroded shields behind! The next wave is coming! Brace for impact!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...I've about had it. Where in the world are all of these Fallen even coming from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The second and third lines are ready to move out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Then take both flanks, and let's clean up those Fallen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We're never going to be able to provide backup for Daphne at this rate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>When did so many Fallen manage to make it into the town, anyway?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You're asking the wrong question, but you are on the right track! There is no castle that cannot be breached, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>One must always plan for a worst-case scenario, such as an enemy infiltration in far greater numbers than could reasonably be anticipated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Father? No... Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I am Ignacio. Though I have also been called Esai.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Pleased to meet you, daughter of my dearest friend. I think I'll keep you alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And just what does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(What an icy cold glare. He's looking at me like I'm nothing!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I know about the hidden passage to the tower's foundation in the castle ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Your plan is to use that to sneak in, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh? Wait, how do you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Is everyone prepared?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This will be a race against time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>While Eulalia and the others keep Ouroboros' phantoms busy outside, we'll recapture the tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Let's move out!</td>
