<td>Jeez... Can't even walk two steps without stepping on an octopus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It smells so strongly of the sea here. Are these really ruins? It's plainly an octopus den...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I believe I did mention that. It appears to be both.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Um... A cult that worshipped a Demon once used this cave as their base. That was a long time ago, though. Now these octopuses call it home, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Demon worshippers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Heretics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>R-right. After a time, all maps and documents relating to these ruins became scarce.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So they were forgotten... But I think it was probably because someone tried to remove every trace of that cult's existence from Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh! U-um... Sorry. I was babbling, wasn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Not at all, Xiao-Xiao. I can tell that you really did a lot of research into this. I'm impressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Now, which way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh! U-um...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wait. I hear something... The sound of a sword striking stone...or something similarly hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A fight?! D'you think...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Grooorgghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Heheh! This is too easy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hey, Kaya! Do you think this thing's the culprit behind the beach attacks? It's gotta be, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The Demon was sealed... I observed traces of the magics used to bind it. So why is it roaming free?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Did someone release it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey! Kaya! Are you listening to me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Grooorgghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah! Shenmei! Look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Whoa! With a single hit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's Shenmei for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Phew! That was a close one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Waitâ€”what the heck?! Liu Shen! Su Yi! What're you two doing here?! Are you lost...? Nah, no way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmph. Not a chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Right, then... Oh! Were you looking for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Really?! Aww, that's so sweet of you! I'm so lucky to have such a caring crew!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Do you realize how worried we were?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Y-yep! My bad! Really sorry about that. Really, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You don't need to apologize to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm not the one who found these ruins. Nor was I the one who was desperate to come looking for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Su Yi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>One who is worried for another finds themselves being worried about instead... I suspect this is much more common than anyone ever thinks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Most people are only capable of seeing things from their own perspective, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh... Thanks, Su Yi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Shenmei...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Aw, man! What was I thinking, charging off alone like that? How can I call myself captain after this? I'm so sorry, guys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>From now on, I'm going to make sure I listen to what my navigator has to say. That's a promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Kaya! So this is where you've been. I'm glad to see you're all right! Have you been with Shenmei this whole time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>No, I just happened to encounter her along the way. I was investigating these ruins for clues about the monster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Is that why you went off on your own? Couldn't you have just told us that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>This ancient site has been forgotten by the people, and I thought it would be wisest to avoid tampering with its natural state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hence I decided to examine this site without announcing my activities to the world. Archeological investigations are my specialty, and I was quite interested in this site on a personal level as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>However, it appears that some of my hypotheses might have been slightly...off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Not another octopus! Jeez, that thing is huge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>So this is the giant octopus I've been hearing so much about...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Look! There's something stuck to its leg... Are those swimming trunks?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Didn't a beachgoer lose a pair of those? But that means this octopus is the monster that's been attacking the beach!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>For now, all we need to do is focus on taking these eight-armed fiends and their master down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I wonder how many minutes it'd take to deep-fry the gargantuan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Here it comes!</td>
