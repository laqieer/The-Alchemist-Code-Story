<td>Let's take on the “Subdue the Owl Beast” quest then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huh? D-do you think we'll be alright against such a powerful monster?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Do you mean to complain against me choosing this quest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>N-no, I'm not complaining, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I can't just ignore people in trouble. And I already accepted Mirina's request anyway. So let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmm... I guess it must be around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't you feel like there's something unusual about the atmosphere?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh? Don't say scary things like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, something moved!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hey, don't just rush in like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>W-wait up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Uhhh...it's so bright...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...Where am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...!<br>W-who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I am Ouroboros—the observer of destiny who bonds this world with truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This is the Door of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The Door...of Truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You must be from Arcania.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Monsters from your world have invaded this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>A link was made between a part of the continent of Babel and a part of your world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>A link with our world?<br>Besides, I've never even heard of this continent of Babel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Unfortunately, this world's people cannot defeat these monsters of your world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Moreover, the monsters from your world have established their stronghold around the source of these events, and they're attacking the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I summoned you here due to the powerful light in your souls, to ask you to destroy these monsters, and to destroy the source of this phenomenon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What kind of monsters are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well...it seems like this one is leading the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh, an Owl Beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Then it seems like our objectives are in alignment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Umm, Miss...Ouroboros? We are adventurers from Arcania, aiming to reach Yggdrasil, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And we were just asked at a place called the Twilight Tavern, to subdue the Owl Beast, who has been recently causing destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So... even though I don't quite understand this link between worlds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But if there are people in trouble because of these monsters, I suppose it doesn't change what we were planning to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hm, adventurers huh?<br>Let me ask you once more then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Please subdue the monster causing destruction in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You have the freedom to accept or reject this request though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If you ask us like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We don't have a choice but to accept your request!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Good! I'll be watching over the brilliance of your souls!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh? What is this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh, I've seen those monsters before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Alright, let's go then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What? Already?!</td>
