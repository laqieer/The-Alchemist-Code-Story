<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Pheeew! We beat them all somehow... I'm bushed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Right, um... Yeah... Same...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why did you come and help me? Even after what I said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>On top of that, helping me has no benefit to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Why? It's because we're friends, duh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It has nothing to do with what pros or cons! You're my friend, so I was worried and I wanted to protect you! I don't need a reason to protect a friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A friend...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(A friend is a someone that weaklings use and get used by. That's it. I have no need for that.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(That's what I thought... Silma didn't have to come for me. So that must mean...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Jeez! I'm relieved that I made it on time, but don't go running off by yourself and doing anything crazy again, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You really worried me there! It's just like Corvus said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Corvus? What does he have to do with this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, you know, Corvus said that, "As strong as Ila has become, she'll try to do everything by herself..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The Shadow Messiah are comrades guided by the same darkness, but she is not yet able to surrender herself to it completely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>When she becomes aware of the darkness surrounding herself and can treasure what's important, then Ila's own darkness will grow deeper and stronger...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That is what the darkness within me whispers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Bewildering... That's just like him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That man always, always talks in riddles! But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>However, your darkness is still a far cry from being true darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You're always too hard to understand! Say it in a way that normal people like me can make sense of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm telling you that you still lack the power to handle a mission on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(I seriously never know what that guy is trying to say.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(Was he seriously trying to tell me not to try to handle everything on my own when I have comrades that I could rely on?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(So Corvus was really worried about me...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hey, Ila! Are you listening? I'm talking, Ila!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What! I'm listening! I got it! I'll be more careful next time! And, I guess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Um... I guess... Um, th-thanks for saving me earlier...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...Friends, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hmm? You say something, Ila?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's nothing. Just...next time, I said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Next time, I'll be the one to protect you... Because we're friends.</td>
