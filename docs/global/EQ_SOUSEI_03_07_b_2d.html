<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This region isn't like ours. There are many more people to feed the Beast with their sins here.</td>

<td>You're saying that it's stronger, too? How can we fight something like this?</td>

<td>Definitely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You're right. There's no time to dwell on what happened. We must focus on what we can do now!</td>

<td>Nimul, what should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>They'll only be more suspicious if we flee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Let's surrender as we were told. We must hope that someone on their side will listen to what we have to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>And so, the worst possible turn of events came to pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We had always lived in fear of the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>They had the power to shake the very ground and plow through every achievement built by the people. They were avatars of disaster.</td>

<td>Always living in the shadow of our fear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast had been awakened. Icona was gone without a trace. And we had become wanted criminals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>With our hearts heavy with worry and uncertainty, we moved forward into the great unknown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Always moving forward, in search of what we could do next.</td>
