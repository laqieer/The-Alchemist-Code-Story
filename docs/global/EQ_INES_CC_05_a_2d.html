<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>So Nasario is somewhere in here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It seems so. The ones who abducted him are no doubt extremists plotting to sabotage our relationship with the high elves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I've done considerable research on them and identified their hideout, but this is the first opportunity I've had to properly infiltrate it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Look, Claris! A feather!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That is undeniably one of the plumes from his clothing. This confirms what the spirits told me. We must hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ugh, it's so dark...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>As is to expected, unfortunately, given that we're inside a cave. Will you be all right in here, Ines?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Y-Yes. I'll be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(I can handle this. Because right now, Nasario must be having a much harder time than I am...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(I have to stay strong!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Stop dilly-dallying! Grab her already, and stuff her in the carriage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heh. She'll fetch a fine price. The high elves really are as beautiful as they say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Don't leave any marks. It's rare to get your hands on one without 'em. Any cut on her skin is gonna be a cut in our profits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Her face looks like a little kid's, but I betcha she's been alive for hundreds o' years. Elves are basically monsters, when you get right down to it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ines?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>S-sorry. I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Here. Watch this. Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Whoa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You can see ahead now, right? And you can also see your own two feet, so you won't trip and fall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Now that you know what's out there, there's no need to be afraid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Claris...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You're right. I'm not scared anymore. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oi! How are we gonna lure the representative here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Security around her is so tight, we can't get anywhere near her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Tch! And after gettin' ourselves some prime high elf bait, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Fools. Our representative would never come to such a treacherous place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm sorry to say your little scheme has failed. You couldn't even capture me without resorting to underhanded tactics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Relying upon incantation gear! Honestly. The divide between our abilities and yours is wide as a chasm. I pity your kind and their small-minded ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You wanna say that to my face? Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'd prefer not. It's best to keep your distance, as the sound of your shrill human screeching hurts my ears enough even from afar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Heh. I wonder how much longer you can keep up that tough-guy act.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Don't you dare lay your dirty hands upon me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>We were plannin' to kill your representative so the festival falls apart, but you know what? Maybe you'll do just fine after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This incantation gear renders your high-and-mighty elf powers useless. We finally perfected it, after testin' it on lots o' elves from lots o' places!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>How sad. All because you're so afraid of what we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Oi! Say that again! I dare ya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Such typical human bluster...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Big talk from you, too, for someone restrained by our incantation gear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Stop!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Nasario! Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ines?! Why are you here? Why did you come here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Claris! Why would you bring Ines to a place like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It's not her fault. I came of my own accord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's because of me that you're in this position. I couldn't just sit by and do nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>But you must! It's imperative you not fight with the humans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hahaha! Looks like we'll be able to wreck this festival after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Will you, now? You really think you can get away with this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What, you think you can stop us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>W-we got trouble, boss! Knights from Northern Pride are headed this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Before coming here, I used my family name to request their aid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I've prepared very carefully for this festival. And in doing so, I've come to know a great many things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I know there are people like you out there, for instance. And that my power alone is not enough to help Ines and her companions in their time of need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But because of that knowledge, I can plan my next move accordingly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hrgh... Curse you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Haaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Aaaaaargghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>This light...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>(The spirits aren't dispersing at all, but rather blessing Ines and Claris alike!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Nasario! Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>There's no need for concern. The waves from your spell merely grazed me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Do be on your guard, though. That man's incantation gear seals high elf magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Oh! So that's how you were captured!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We been preparin' lots of other things, too, so we can fight you monsters off real efficient-like!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Monsters? Us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You lot live in the same body for hundreds o' years, barely agin' a day in a decade! That ain't natural. It ain't right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>We're oil and water, so stop tryin' to pretend we can get along! There's no point makin' friends with freaks. We'll kill every last one o' ya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>The spirit's blessing is not leaving us. It seems my fear was misplaced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I believe it's because you are enemies of humans and high elves alike. So there is no longer any need to hold back my power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Allow me to show you the true strength of the "monsters" that you fear so much!</td>
</tr>
