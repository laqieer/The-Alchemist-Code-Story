<td>Phew... I'm so glad we won...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hmph. Like I said, fighting on land and sea is different. Someone like me who understands that won't lose, no matter the circumstances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You’re amazing, Gormalas! If you're this strong on land, you must be crazy strong on the ocean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hoo! It gets me excited about the idea of going to the ocean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's like you weren't listening to me at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No, I was totally listening! That's why I'm so into the idea! I've never seen any kind of ocean, blue or violent, or whatever else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I had no idea that the ship could rock so much that you wouldn't be able to sleep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>There's so much I still don't know about the world! I'm getting pumped just thinking about it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Heh. You're an interesting kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hehe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So, about my pay for fighting...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Fons and Reeves, was it? I'm sure we can work something out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You might not know this, but Tigferes can fetch a pretty price on the market. Just hand them over and I'll call it even.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's why you offered to lend me money?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What did you think it was for? I told you that you might regret being so darn innocent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I just thought you were a good guy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I warned you about that, didn't I? I'm a pirate. I take what I want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Fons and Reeves are my family. I won't give them to anyone, not even you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Guess we have to do this the hard way, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Get back, you two! I'll take care of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Heh. All right. I like that look in your eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Someone with eyes like that wouldn't be cowardly enough to flee from the sea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Eh. I'm over this. See ya 'round, Tomas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?! Where’re you going?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>How can you just be over it after all that?! Was this a test or something?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Gormalas! Hey, uh... Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I definitely wanna go to the ocean one day! Everything you said just made me itch to get out of here even more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm gonna get stronger, and taller, and then I'll become tough enough to beat even you, Gormalas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>He's gone... Can't even see him anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It was pretty nice that he finally called me by my name at the end, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Grr?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yeah, you're right. I gotta train and study more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Grr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yeah! Let's all go to the ocean together someday. Maybe we'll see Gormalas there!</td>
