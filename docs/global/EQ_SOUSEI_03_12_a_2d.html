<td>I've got it! Nimul, Minario! It's this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Took you long enough! At this rate, I won't have any ammunition left to take on my father!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>How far away is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Just a little further! Just through that door...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The mayor's office!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Nimul?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Emmel! I'm so glad you're safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sorry to cut this emotional family reunion short.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Father! I'm going to put an end to this madness of yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm afraid it's too late for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What do you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>All analyses complete. Now activating Cursed Beast Captivity Protocol: Valley of Siddim.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Excellent. Commence activation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes, mayor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No, you can't! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>How... How could you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I cannot turn back now. I will not. My decision has already been made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This...is the proof of my resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Father... What have you done to yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I did what I had to do. This machine is insufficient to maintain ongoing control over the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Thus, I mechanized myself and incorporated myself into the system used to control the Cursed Beast's magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I, of course, did not hesitate to do my part.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The mayoral office of Redington is conferred upon the most accomplished researcher of the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>How often does one have the opportunity to take a mind like that and mechanize its vessel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So you threw away your humanity in exchange for the power of a Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What better way is there? The Cursed Beasts have certain defenses against humankind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The best way to work around them is to become something other than human. It's simply the most efficient solution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I can't believe that you would go so far...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I told you. This is the proof of my resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>As a politician, I've forced my people to sacrifice countless things. It's only fitting that the greatest price be mine to pay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You...hardheaded... Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It doesn't matter how brilliant you are if you don't have any values!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What good is resolve if you're not using it to save other people?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Someone as wise as you... Someone so much wiser than I am...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You could have found some other way to give everyone in this region a happy life... I know it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, Minario... There is a limit to human intelligence. There is no power that can save everyone. None at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Don't give up before you even try! I sure won't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I believe we can reach the promised land someday without relying on the Cursed Beasts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>So I'm going to stop you. For the sake of this region!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I will act in line with my logic, and you will act as your beliefs demand. That...is our fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>On that note, what will you do, Adaleigh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Obviously, I'm going to stop you, Icona. Your plan is too risky. I can't accept it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That is exactly how I feel about yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Your intention to exterminate the Cursed Beast is a tightrope walk if ever I've seen one... As is mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>So what makes your plan any better than ours, hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Because! We're fighting so that nobody else gets hurt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Right now...you'd sacrifice anyone for the results you want. It's wrong to hurt people for the sake of your goal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's called being narrow-minded. That is the way of Sloth, Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You aren't even trying to see things the way myself and the mayor do. It's lazy of you to not even consider the possibility that our way might be better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If my hypothesis is correct, the results will speak for themselves when the wider world is saved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Our plan is far more likely to do that than if you were to kill the Cursed Beast. Are you not willing to even consider that possibility?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I don't know anything about the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I'm always just desperately doing whatever I can in the moment, but I have no idea where it might lead. There's no guarantee that my hard work will pay off, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>There are people out there giving their all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>If I sacrifice those people, people who are clawing their way through life as desperately as I am... I couldn't live with myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If this hope of saving others is what you call Sloth...? I'll take it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'll take the path I consider right, Icona. I'll walk it proudly of my own will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>A very good answer, Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Then I, too, shall walk my own path. Come to think of it.. This is a first, isn't it? We've never had a sibling squabble before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Adaleigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Forgive my selfishness, Nimul, but I need to take Icona down with my own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Understood, but let me back you up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...Thank you.</td>
</tr>
