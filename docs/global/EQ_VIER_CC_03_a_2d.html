<td>002</td>
<td>(Night was approaching.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Like blood binds the body, like the river connects the mountains to the sea, and our souls are bound together as the wind connects you to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>For eons... As countless ages passed... The souls of high elves, hunted by the other races, must have sowed the potential for retribution within our very DNA.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And so, the soul of a high elf slain by one of their own would curse their kin. After all, were high elves not the most innocent? The most pure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yet the sinners would be transformed by the blood, Alchemia, and souls of the high elves they killed, marking their bodies with the evil deed they had done. Even their descendants were cursed to carry that mark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The sin of betraying their people carried forevermore. Inherited even by the descendants with no memories of committing such sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That is right... You are innocent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(There are none left who remember. How did our blood come to be corrupted? Why did the war begin so long ago?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(Was it out of malice? For profit? Was it poverty or faith? Who would benefit from it? There was already too much lost that losing the war was barely noteworthy.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That is right. We dark elves are sacrifices. Our existence served to prove the ideology that the high elves are eternally pure and incorruptible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That is why I left my home behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Trying to find yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>They spend their near-eternal lifespans in a small world, condemning other races, letting their egos swell to unbearable levels... I was suffocating there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I was afraid of hating myself...of hating the high elf race... So I wanted to find my own way to exist as a high elf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Did you enjoy your journey?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I traveled through many nations over a very long time, hoping for somewhere more comforting than home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I visited many high elven communes around the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And what I found there were the same things I saw in Fairgreen. Prejudice against other races and the belief that different is wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>They needed that to preserve their integrity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>To protect their kin, they needed to separate themselves from others. To protect themselves, they needed to have easily identifiable enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And so high elves declared your people to be our enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>And in turn the dark elves declared your people to be ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>When those who do not age pursue a noble existence, the longer they endure, the more they hold corruption in contempt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It became clear to me that I was no different from those foolish high elves, so taken with their own egos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Unable to forge bonds with others...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The longer one lives, the more apparent it becomes that their own race is just as corrupted as the others. The more polished their opponent on the surface, the more clearly they see themselves reflected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>There is no need to blame yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Better to attack myself than your people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Is it? You and I are different. You and I are the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wherever we are, we scrabble for survival in the same way. We have to fight for the things we need, such as food and shelter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Is there no possibility of a future where we smile together in peace?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh, did you not notice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I was only able to smile when fighting against you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>But that has now come to an end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The most polished beauty exists only to be chipped away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>We all get worn down to nothing, don't we?</td>
