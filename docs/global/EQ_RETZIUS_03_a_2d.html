<td>Listen. Recently, these thieves have been taking extreme measures. We can't predict exactly how they'll act. There may very well be casualties.</td>

<td>Mercenary Captain</td>
<td>However, we do this in order to maintain order in the desert. This mission is nothing more than the prelude, but it is an integral part of our strategy to annihilate these thieves!</td>
