<td>This medicine will heal those in this country suffering from Demon's Blood. I place this in your hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>All right then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well then, I will go now. You be careful out there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wadatsumi is a country with a lot greenery, flowing rivers, and scenic views!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>By the way, are you planning on walking all night? That being said, I don't really like the prospect of sleeping out here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, I'm something of a night owl. I'm used to walking at night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...Hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hm? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Don't 'what's the matter?' me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Earlier, I asked you to spread the medicine I gave you to cure Demon's Blood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yeah, I know. Leave it to me! I'll spread it well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Then why are you following me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, all things considered...this is my first time in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I don't know where anything is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Besides, you know, didn't you just warn me about getting attacked again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're strong and, if we're together, it just feels more reassuring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That may be the case, but...for starters, why are you alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, I like being a merchant traveling wherever I please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Sigh... Anyway, do as you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Really?! Ah, thanks! That's right. I still haven’t asked for your name yet. My name is Arkil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...I'm Jin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Mr. Jin, huh? Nice to meet you! By the way, Mr. Jin, I wanna ask you one thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Just call me Jin, Arkil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>All right, Jin. That Demon's Blood you were talking about...what kind of sickness is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Would you know of it by its other name: Ogre Fever?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ogre Fever...you mean the one where you get an abnormally high fever for an extensive period of time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's the one. With the aforementioned invasion, it was brought into this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Right now it is referred to as Demon's Blood and it is spreading!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But Ogre Fever isn't that dangerous of a sickness, you know? I had it too when I was little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>There should be a specific medicine you can take.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>In other countries they have it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Then you could just import it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's not that easy. Wadatsumi has been destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>There's no way of any engaging in any reasonable trade with other counties when we are now under the jurisdiction of Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's a sickness that we never had in this country. Its existence wasn't even known. Right now they call it the "incurable disease."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Having gone abroad, within my travels I learned that Demon's Blood was not an incurable disease.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That's why I studied it and received some of this invaluable medicine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And, not wanting to rely on outside resources, I tried to make it using ingredients found here in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That's a noble endeavor. Much respect to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>There's nothing noble about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No, I think it's noble. Oh, there's one thing I'm curious about...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You said just now, "Having gone abroad and in my travels," didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It didn't sound like you went to study medicine, so why did you leave the country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I had my reasons... Why do you ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No, just curious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>For someone who makes medicine, you struck a skillful pose while fighting out there earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>To be accurate, making medicine isn't my profession...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yeah? Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>For a merchant, you're also very accustomed to fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yeah. Well, when you're a traveling merchant you encounter a lot of dangers on the road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You learn to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I see. Well, we both seem to have our own agendas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It appears so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hey, wait. Can you sense something...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hm? Is it coming from over there...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Agyaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What is that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Is it one of this country's monsters?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Huff...huff...huff...! Uck...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yo...mi...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...?! Yomi...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Oh...nothing! That's my sister's name. It just sounded similar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>More importantly, she's hurt. Aren't we gonna help her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Of course, we are!</td>
</tr>
