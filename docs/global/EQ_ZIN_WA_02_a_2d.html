<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zin.png" alt="Jin" height="128"><br>Jin</td>
<td>It's not that easy. Wadatsumi has been destroyed.</td>

<td>Besides...</td>

<td>There's nothing noble about it.</td>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arki.png" alt="Arkil" height="128"><br>Arkil</td>
<td>You said just now, "Having gone abroad and in my travels," didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arki.png" alt="Arkil" height="128"><br>Arkil</td>
<td>It didn't sound like you went to study medicine, so why did you leave the country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I had my reasons... Why do you ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>No, just curious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arki.png" alt="Arkil" height="128"><br>Arkil</td>
<td>For someone who makes medicine, you struck a skillful pose while fighting out there earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zin.png" alt="Jin" height="128"><br>Jin</td>
<td>To be accurate, making medicine isn't my profession...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arki.png" alt="Arkil" height="128"><br>Arkil</td>
<td>Yeah? Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zin.png" alt="Jin" height="128"><br>Jin</td>
<td>For a merchant, you're also very accustomed to fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arki.png" alt="Arkil" height="128"><br>Arkil</td>
<td>Yeah. Well, when you're a traveling merchant you encounter a lot of dangers on the road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arki.png" alt="Arkil" height="128"><br>Arkil</td>
<td>You learn to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zin.png" alt="Jin" height="128"><br>Jin</td>
<td>I see. Well, we both seem to have our own agendas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arki.png" alt="Arkil" height="128"><br>Arkil</td>
<td>It appears so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hey, wait. Can you sense something...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arki.png" alt="Arkil" height="128"><br>Arkil</td>
<td>Hm? Is it coming from over there...?</td>
