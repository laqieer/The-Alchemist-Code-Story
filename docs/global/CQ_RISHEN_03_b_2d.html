<td>Yes! The day is ours! Now we must quell these rampaging monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Eeep! S-Save me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>To battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Does Xiao-Xiao intend to save even our enemies from the monsters?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Of course! We've already won! There's no need for further bloodshed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If there's anyone we can help, then we will! That's being a Xiao Shenmei pirate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(Those kind ideals never really fit with being a pirate. But the straightforward dedication to them has never wavered since long ago.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Listen up! Captain's orders! Victory is ours! Now turn your attentions to fighting the monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No one is going to be made some monster's meal! That includes the enemy pirates!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>No objections? Huh... I suppose this only normal for Xiao-Xiao.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>She puts such strong faith in her allies, so we feel obliged to live up to that trust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's like we get to bear witness to a special kind of miracle. And in order to do that... I will follow her to the ends of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Glorious victory to the Xiao Shenmei pirates! We did it, Liu Shen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So we did. That's what makes us the Xiao Shenmei pirates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Xiao-Xiao, here's the report from the incident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Okay, leave it there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>To forgive this for so little compensation when your life was in danger... Were you not one of us, there'd be complaints.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's because they're with us now that they're forgiven! Besides, that group of them has mended their ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That we saved all of them seems to have had a notable impact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The actions of that so-called council were atrocious even to the other members. It's no surprise he's been expelled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I've learned that when an organization tries to grow too fast, it leaves the door open to that unsavory type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm truly sorry for what happened this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The Xiao Shenmei has enough crew. We can overcome any obstacle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>As long as I am here, no one will stand in our way. I hope you will allow me to remain as your second-in-command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't be silly... Of course, I will! I expect you always at my side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And I don't think we'll have any worries finding more crew in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh? Why's that? What are those papers you've been looking over?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ever since that event, we've received a great many requests from people wanting to sail on the Xiao Shenmei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Heh... I suppose the world just can't leave a captain like you alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hehe â™ª Seems this may bode well for our treasure hunt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>All right, we set sail today, too! All hands on deck! Full rudder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hey, where are we going? We better not go off course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hmm... Well, you're in charge of that, Liu Shen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Very well. I'll assume the helm. C'mon crew! We're setting sail! We make for Captain Shenmei's destination!</td>
