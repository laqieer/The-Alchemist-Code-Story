<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Tch! One after another...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>At this rate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That voice... The altar's Protector?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What are you waiting for?! This way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Logi, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Y-yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The ancient Sephira barrier still functions here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We should be safe here for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It is so vexing, not being able to join the fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yet I am nothing more than a fragment of history, a memory. This body of mine is no good in a fight anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I am sorry. Had I found you sooner, I would have been able to give you a more complete transmutation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ah, don't say that. To have been able to pass on my words and exist in this world to this day was more than I could have hoped for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Kamui, how is Georgios doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>He still lives...but without treatment, he won't for much longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Isn't there something we can do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Georgios! You're awake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Turn me into a Phantom. Then I should be able to fight alongside you for the time being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I know you can do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But then your mortal being will—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This is a dying body anyway. What reason do I have to hesitate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This chaos is partially my fault. I never knew my cousin cared so deeply. I wouldn't be able to rest in peace without seeing this matter settled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Gyaar! Grrrr! Gluuuurrrrp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There's no time to think! Just do it, Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I see... Very well, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Kamui? What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>This is a sinful act. This deed will inevitably bring me to ruin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yet...I cannot turn away from the hearts and minds of those who have passed. I cannot overlook the lamentations of those who are leaving this mortal realm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Therefore, I walk this path without hesitation. "This form of mine, no longer supreme—"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Kamui's Alchemia is surging so intensely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>"Paths come to an end, as does your breath. Tomorrow is distant, yet your march is strong. If you will search for another unseen day—"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>"Then answer my call, and grab hold of your ephemeral awakening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Urgh... Aaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>His physical form is turning into a Phantom! Is this the result of Kamui's Spiritbonding?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Your purpose lies with this battle. Once we achieve peace, your body will turn to dust and fade away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Then my time here is limited, you mean... Heh. It's all I need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Kamui, what was that?! Don't tell me you had to pay some price for such a feat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Do not worry about it. My fated time drew closer, that is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I've wielded this power freely for the past one hundred years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It's about time I paid the price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Well, it appears the barrier is reaching its limit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>My arm is at the ready for whatever you need, Kamui. Just say the word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We must reach the arboreal altar, but we will need more strength to get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>There must be some way to get through and reconvene with the Liberation Army!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That sounds like a plan. Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
