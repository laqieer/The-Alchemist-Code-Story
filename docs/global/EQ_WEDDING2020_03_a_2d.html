<td>001</td>
<td>SQUEAK!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Dang! They got away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Lady Lucia, you're incorrigible... Those Rattys seem frightened, didn't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>They did… This area must be unfamiliar to them, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I see why they came here, though. Their usual habitat is deep in the forest where it’s cool and dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>On average, they're docile creatures that rarely harm humans and are terrified of fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Lord Ewan, you have such a wide breadth of knowledge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Soldiers often conduct camping missions, so I picked up a few survival tricks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>For being such docile creatures, they certainly seemed agitated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes… The townsfolk mentioned they appeared here out of nowhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hm… Yet monsters have never taken up residence here before. Don't you think it's bizarre?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, given the ear-splitting work that goes on here, I doubt this place is ideal…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>They wouldn't come here unless there was a good reason…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmm… This weapon isn't very easy to handle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Maybe if it was used more like a Ratty claw...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Lucia, you can't throw yourself in front of monsters just to research them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hm? Why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What if you got injured?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I can handle a few bumps and bruises in the name of research!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wow. You don't seem phased at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You getting injured would not only justify the current closure, it would prompt a total shutdown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>How are you going to make your weapon then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I hadn't thought about that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>In that case, you’d better take care not to get hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>*Grumble* What do you care if I get hurt, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Lady Lucia, Lord Ewan is just concerned for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Really? How come? I'm saying it's fine, so there's no need to worry…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Easy for you to say… I can't just let you get hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>After all, a soldier's duty is to protect others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh brother… That line again? I'm sick of hearing you say that…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What about what you want to do? Not as a soldier--as you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You know, you're always smiling, but you're not happy at all, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hm? What's that? Uzuma, that shiny thing over there--could that be Felicitite?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm going to have a look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ah! Lady Lucia, please wait! Don't go off by yourself! It's dangerous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Honestly…she never changes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…Is she always like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Mm-hmm. She's made the most of becoming a Phantom by focusing on enemy weapon research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I don't get it. How can she do that…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>For her, creating weapons is more important than anything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I see… She wasn't forced to make weapons until she became a Phantom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>"Forced?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The military took advantage of her innate power. That must be what changed her...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That's why she continues to fixate on weapons. Even though no one is forcing her to anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You think she changed? You of all people should know the hearts of men don't change so easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Are you sure you're not referring to yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>…What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You only see what's on the surface. You aren't trying to see who Lucia truly is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>No one has the right to decide the happiness of another. Don't impose your rigid version of truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Are you going off alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>A friend of mine always told me the key to reconnaissance is to travel lightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You must mean that spy from Wratharis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>She’s a bit of a loose cannon, but her skills as a secret agent are second to none. Best to follow her advice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I'll entrust Lucia to you. This may be a good chance for you to learn something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(The hearts of men don't change easily…Yes, I know that very well.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>(My men…they all died with the same desires burning in their hearts…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>To fight alongside a leader who vows to protect the people--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It's the greatest honor! I'd follow you to the ends of the earth, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I vowed to protect the weak from senseless violence. That's why I became a soldier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I would rather live and die by that vow than to ever waver.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>As long as I stay true to myself, I'll be happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>And I'll be happy to fight alongside likeminded comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You know, you're always smiling, but you're not happy at all, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>(How can they all smile?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>There's nothing to smile about…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>What did you find?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Hmm…It sure is shiny, but this isn't Felicitite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>But I bet something great can be made out of this, so I'm taking it. What should I make, I wonder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Lady Lucia, you really love making weapons, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Making weapons is everything to me. I'll do whatever it takes to make something great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I can't say that near Ewan or he'll scold me again--even though I told him I'll be fine. He's such a killjoy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I'm certain Lord Ewan has good intentions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You think? I dunno. He really annoyed me earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>He said he wanted me to realize there are things more important than weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>What could be more important than weapons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Maybe if I find the answer, that will help me create a wedding knife that isn't a weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>How's it going, you two? Did you find any Felicitite?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Nope. Nothing. We've got to go deeper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>*Shriek*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Who could that be? I thought the mine was sealed off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>There’s no time! We've got to help them!</td>
</tr>
