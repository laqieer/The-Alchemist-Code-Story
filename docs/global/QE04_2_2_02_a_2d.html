<td>Argh... The blasted Jam! They just won't stop springing up everywhere...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Let's keep our guard up. We can't afford to suffer any further casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well then, let's hear the continuation of your story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Come now, boy...if you remain silent, you could very well bring about the destruction of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Saga will not perish! I will keep my promise at all costs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hm...so now you admit that you did make a promise. Isn't it about time you told everything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This is a brutal story about how I destroyed the wind and was burdened with the consequences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Are you prepared to allow Tamis to hear all of what I have to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Mocca, don't worry about me. I'm fine, Fuu. I will accept anything for the sake of protecting the future of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The future of Saga, huh? Here we go again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Do you feel like talking now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Protect the village and guard it against harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>As I must manage the Matter, I cannot afford to exterminate the Jam. Those are the conditions I am setting forth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>First, let me give you a history lesson...about Gluttony Foss' Sacred Stone Beelzebub and the containment of its gluttonous power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Long ago, in the south of Gluttony, there was a large tree called Sephiron that was decorated with a mysterious pattern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This pattern was detailed, and, if deciphered, it was rumored that you could obtain a vast variety of knowledge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It was a holy tree that was said to hold the power of purification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The power of purification...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Thus, it held the power to suppress Beelzebub's gluttonous power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The people who prospered under the tree of Sephiron...the Sephira...they received mysterious powers and wisdom from it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Due to this, many of them held a high concentration of Alchemia within them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Furthermore, they were able to use Alchemia to wield their Spiritbonding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Is that kind of like Alchemy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes. However, seeing this power as a threat, the Gluttony army went on a rampage and destroyed both Sephiron and the people of Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So...the power of purification was lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes. Beelzebub's rampage resulted in turning southern Gluttony Foss into a desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Beelzebub's rampage...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>However, the rampage was suppressed immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>How?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We used the power of the four Matters that exist within Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Wait, Beelzebub was in Gluttony's possession...so why was Saga's Matter used?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>At the time, the Kingdom of Gluttony and the successor of the Alize people formed an alliance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>In order to contain the berserk Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Gluttony Foss and...Saga were working together?!</td>
</tr>
