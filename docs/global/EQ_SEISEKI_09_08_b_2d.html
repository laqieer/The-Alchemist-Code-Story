<td>Ugh! D-do you even know what you're doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yo-you're doing the same thing...that Greed Dike is doing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Using force to effect the will of the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That is the same thing the people of Greed Dike said...wh-when they destroyed your hometown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What kind of nonsense...? No, we're different from you people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I-it's the same...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Look...at what you're doing right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The country that you are now trying to invade is the same as Wadatsumi was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>These people that live in grief are the same as you were once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>O-of course I understand where you are coming from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But...we're not trying to conquer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Whatever you may say...I cannot forgive your invasion of us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...! S-silence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I-if you want to silence me then you must eradicate me! Just like Greed Dike did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Don't try to fool me with such words! Please, vanish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is that...a burning hill?! Look how big it is...almost as if it were a mountain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>As that giant boulder falls...so too shall your false justice be eradicated from this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...along with this hotbed of deceit which is Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You have exhausted all options. Come now and taste your final moments...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...Nothing you can say will make me hesitate. There is only one thing I must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Are you serious? That giant rock...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If it's a hallucination, so be it. If it's real, then I will destroy it before it falls. That's all there is to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Nonsense. What can you do with just a bow and arrow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I've had enough of you flapping your gums.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I won't hesitate anymore! I am supported by my friends who passed away that day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I will use all my power!!! Disappear now! Fox Fang!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Impossible...you stopped the boulder?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ugh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Agh!!! H-how?! That large boulder...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Phew... I'm sorry. I'm a little tired now. I'll leave the rest to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm sorry for leaving everything to you. If Captain Cadanova saw this, he'd laugh at me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Have a strong heart. That's the first thing he taught me as a knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Lo-Lord Commander...Kanon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I can see...this country's future...like Wadatsumi...it is filled with people stricken with despair...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Eternal Glow!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Agh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm sorry...the justice you have depicted will lead to despair for others. I cannot allow it to happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I have plunged this country...into a pit of despair...heheh...if I...no...even if I cannot do it...Sol would...I'm sure of it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I will never again allow any place in all of this continent to become the way that Wadatsumi became.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We won't allow it...never. Now sleep gently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Do you think...I would trust...the justice of the Holy Guard...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Um...mmm...So...Sol...please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Please give light...to the children of Lost Blue...who are filled with...potential...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We...live in a land where the sun does not reach...we must give the oppressed people...the same rights...that those above land have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Our...sky...in...Lo...Lost...Blue...!!! Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The only difference...is the form of justice we believe in. Why do we have to fight like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>That's true. But...every person has their own idea of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>If we are going to live together in this world, we must learn to make compromises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Look, Seida! Those tens of thousands of soldiers have disappeared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>All the streets and buildings that had collapsed have been restored...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>No...that's not the amazing thing. She...on her own, created all of those hallucinations...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>All alone...the depth of her despair...became a source of power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I cannot applaud the use of her power...but I certainly understand...what she was trying convey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>This is most definitely their way of buying time. The main army of Greed Dike must be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Commander Kanon! I have received a report from the border guards that Lord Kazahaya has returned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Just Kazahaya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Indeed! The main Greed Dike army seems to be headed towards Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Captain Othima and Basheeny are headed directly towards Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...Seida!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Let's head to Saga. We must do everything we can to prevent Orion's plot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>There's grass as far as I can see. What a beautiful sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>This scenery of Saga must never be lost by the ravages of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Whatever happens we must stop the advancement of Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Almira! How'd it go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>As far I know, nobody seems to have caught sight of the Greed Dike army!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>They may have just not arrived yet, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I see. I'd prefer it was indeed a needless endeavor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>In any case, let's head to the closest tribe village. Are there any difficulties between them and the neighboring tribe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Not at all! We're all living in Saga after all. We get along great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>That's good to hear! All right then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Wait...what is that? I hear the wind blowing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Huh? Wow...you're like Seida!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I learned a bit from her! Hold on a second, are those...soldiers?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Let's go, Almira!</td>
</tr>
