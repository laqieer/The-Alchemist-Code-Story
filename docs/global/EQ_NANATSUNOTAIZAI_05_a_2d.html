<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hahahaha... Well, I only just arrived and it was already dark, so... I essentially wandered around until I found myself here and did my best to avoid the monsters of the night.</td>

<td>I guess it has been a while since we arrived here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Uhm... I'm still quite lost regarding the situation we are in. What is happening to us? Where are we?</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well...</td>

<tr>

<td>I see... I finally understand. I'm sorry that I was not present to help. Had it been daylight...</td>

<td>Oh no, I'm happy that we were able to find each other at all. I was told the others were brought here as well, but I couldn't be sure until I saw you.</td>

<td>I won't be much help to you during the night, after all.</td>

<td>That might be the wisest course of action with Zeldris hovering around. Ah. Would you look at that.</td>
</tr>
