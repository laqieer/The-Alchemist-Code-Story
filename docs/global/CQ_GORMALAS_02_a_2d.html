<td>002</td>
<td>Sorry, Captain! This cave is surprisingly deep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hurry up! I can't let that brat disgrace my honor as a pirate any further!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Behind you, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh?</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Captain!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This scurvy dog is nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...! I won't allow this scum to make a fool of me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Tsk! Who dares to steal my prey?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...I do.</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You! What're you playing at?</td>

<td>What a confusing brat. She's written her own obituary by daring to show her face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You think I owe you something just because you saved me? If you'd shot me down, you'd have saved yourself. But you didn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Don't you get it? If you don't take, others will take from you. That's the pirate's code. It's too late for regrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I don't have any regrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If someone's attacked by a monster, I'll try and save them regardless of who they are. It's the basics of being a human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What kind of nonsense are you spewing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? I'm a pirate, not a villain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That kind of naivety will earn you a watery grave. You're a pirate; don't you get that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I don't. Besides...I have no intention of dying here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Tsk. She wiggled her way out of that one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What shall we do, Captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Chase that brat. The fact that she was here must mean we're near the treasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Aye, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'll tell you this. I, Captain Gormalas, will reign triumphant in the end.</td>
