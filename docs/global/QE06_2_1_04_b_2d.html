<td>I'm so confused...where am I?</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>…We finally meet.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>…Who's there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>…?!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>…</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The whereabouts of the Sacred Three… The Sumeragi resides in the inner sanctums of castle Aquila Rubrum...if what you say is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…Yes. Then there's the Mikaboshi, which is in the custody of Greed Dike, following the agreement with Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That leaves the lost art, Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Even if we learn the lost art, only a member of the Wadatsumi royal family can wield it.</td>

<td>…True. But it's in our best interest to learn it.</td>

<td>…Tch. I'm not sure I agree, but fine. Have it your way.</td>

<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If the Discarnate Power was once sealed away by the Sacred Three...we'll need all the help we can get. Hurry and make your way to Greed Dike.</td>

<td>Where're you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Me? To the archives. To research Kagutsuchi…</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I can handle that by myself. We don't need two people for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh?</td>

<td>Well, time to do what I gotta do…eh?</td>
