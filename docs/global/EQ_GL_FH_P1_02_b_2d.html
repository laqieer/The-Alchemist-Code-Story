<td>Through my sights, I saw the strange man pinned by a hail of fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It felt as if I knew those movements by heart somehow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>A certain kind of savage elegance; a dance of twin blades.</td>

<td>...Kh!</td>

<td>(An opening!)</td>

<td>*gasp*</td>

<td>A gunshot narrowly whizzes overhead as Siegfried tackles Roxanne to the ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oof...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You good, Rox?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Y-yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Quick, he's getting away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But your leg-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'll be fine! But he'll be gone if you don't go after him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yeah, and then I'll still have to carry you around, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...Do you mind if you get off me? You're a little, um, close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Again...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The thundering footsteps of Goetia soldiers interrupts their brief moment.</td>

<td>As Siegfried stares down at the weapon aimed squarely between his eyes, Roxanne suddenly lowers her rifle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Black Rose'. Remember it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We will meet again here, when it is right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I don't under...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>All right.</td>

<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Take care of yourself, Rox.</td>

<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Stop calling me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I don't even know who...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What's the problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I thought there was an unexpected intruder skulking around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Turns out it was just a haywire hologram.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Grimm's intense stare nearly burns a hole in the broken device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The rest of you, search the area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>As for you..that's enough of a detour.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Get back to headquarters. The Doktor will be expecting you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This isn't even anywhere near the designated range.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Something's caught her attention...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The Doktor barely glances at Roxanne as he flips through the report, mumbling to himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hmm... Hmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Reaction time seems on par... No abnormalities as to physical performance...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Slight hesitancy expected... I suppose that is negligible as long as you follow orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Tell me, did you have any...ah, strange thoughts? Memories perhaps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...Yes, but I could not make sense of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What were they about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>People I once considered friends, I suppose. I do not remember their names.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>We will need something to...to suppress those disconcerting memories, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You do not wish to be troubled by them, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>That will be all, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Ah, before you go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The Director would like to see you after you have taken your ease. Something about a new mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'll make my way there immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Alone in the cold, sterile office, the Doktor scans the stack of reports arrayed upon the desk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>To say the inconsistencies in emotional response are insignificant is...an understatement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>But even so, we are dealing with something quite different... Quite different indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I should like to know how this will affect Atropos...</td>
