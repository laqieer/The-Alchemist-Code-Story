<td>The monsters have been eliminated, but the witches at the heart of the plot have escaped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's the true use of Battalion. It's a form of magic that was originally designed to act as a decoy so that the caster may escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>They cast it so smoothly. It was so masterful... Could it be...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ugh...gh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Alma! What's wrong? Where are you hurt?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ugh... I...I screwed up. There were so many of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hold still and let me take a look. I'll cast some healing magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Aaaaargh! At this rate, I'm going to get fat tomorrow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's why I didn't want to use it! I hate it! I hate it so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Get...fat? Wh-what are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>W-wait, you didn't use the magic that...? Then you're not actually hurt? Or...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I can't find any injury. What magic are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I don't really know either. It's a magic that only Alma can use, but apparently it magically boosts her physical abilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If she doesn't use it all up though, it'll turn into calories and she'll put on weight, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Magic...that turns into calories?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That all aside, don't scare us like that! You really haven't been harmed, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, for a young lady, suddenly getting fat is a major enough problem, don't you think?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm sympathetic, really, but...you worried me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Haha... Sorry, sorry. Anyway, what was with those witches before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Do you know what they were after?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Of course I don't... Uh... Ahaha...ha... Um... Of course not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So...you do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I mean... I may have accidentally caught a prominent witch...um...cheating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Is that really something they'd come after me for, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What do you mean you caught them accidentally? You're the one who went looking for trouble, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Lustburg is just so scandalous right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Spring is in full swing! There're hot happenings everywhere! I just have to be the first to gather the gossip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's what got you attacked! One of these days, you're really going to get yourself hurt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yeah, I recently realized that maybe it's kind of dangerous to stick my nose where it's unwanted, so...I've started training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Training?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's right! Come with me, Rebecca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I gotta use up all this magical energy today anyway, and my master has been wanting to meet you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Your...master? I'll admit I'm curious, but today I need to talk with the headmistress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh, well...with the invasion and all the damage I need to assess and report on to the palace...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Could we maybe talk another time, Rebecca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oh, of course. I suppose it can't really be helped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh, wow. Now that you mention it, the hall is a mess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We just finished fixing all the damage the Bugmail caused... Do you have any idea how much these repairs cost us? Glass windows don't just appear out of thin air, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Perhaps, but these windows are surely fated to be broken! I mean, Liz sometimes misses during practice and breaks the glass, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Come to think of it, our windows do tend to break more than those of any other building, don't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wait a moment, this time it's half your fault! Don't just gloss over it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ahem... Moving on. Since your plans fell through, will you come meet my master?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>As if you're not the one who ruined those plans. Hmph. Just what kind of person is this master of yours, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That's for me to know, and look forward to your finding out! Frankly, you'll really be helping me out by coming along, Rebecca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Getting up all the way up into the sky by myself is really rough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The...sky?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm used to it, but if you're worried about the cold we can stop by Liz's and get some caramel jaeger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Excuse me?! Do you think I would overlook a student flying under the influence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Uh, I forgot you were there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The clouds that Asmodeus summoned are gone and the atmospheric temperature is warmer than before. There's no reason for us to drink.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>But why are we going into the sky, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Because the hermit has always been up there! Come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>This is it! This is where the reclusive sage our country is so proud of—and my ogre of a coach—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Who are you calling an ogre? If you're going to call me names, you should up the ante a little. I recommend: demonic coach. Besides, you're the one who came here pleading for my expertise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Melvy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oh! Rebecca! I was wanting to see you. Are you okay? Venus isn't picking on you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>O-oh, yes, I'm fine. Should you be saying things like that about Her Majesty? What if she heard about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hahaha! We've been best friends forever, so it's fine. We're old classmates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What?! That's the first I've heard of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If you were classmates with Her Majesty, then... You'd be over 200 years old! You don't look it at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I spend a great deal of time up here in the air, so I've been directly exposed to Asmodeus' influence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's why I age slower than other people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It's not just me, though. Thanks to that influence, all the air defense mages are a bunch of beauties!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>The selling point for joining us used to be the promise of eternal youth, but now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Well...Asmodeus is gone, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Even with the benefits, it was never that popular of an assignment to begin with. Now, it's almost impossible to get anyone to join! I hope you'll take responsibility and join us, Alma!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>No way! Not right now! I mean, I don't plan on being a reporter for the rest of my life though, so... Someday?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I'm sure a day will come when this country will finally settle down...and maybe then I can join you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>In the hopes of that fabled someday you speak of, I'm doing you this favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Competent adults don't spare any effort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>R-right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Of course, since you're always chasing after the next big scoop, you're always getting yourself into trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Furthermore, there're a lot of weird types of magic around, and a lot of people with crazy tough defenses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>So, in the end, my teaching you the basics of this classical type of martial art is an effort to counter that danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Honestly, being a reporter seems pretty exciting, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>(Melvy and Alma really are cut from the same cloth.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>So, Alma—who may someday join the Air Defense Mages—I'm guessing that you want to practice aerial battling today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Gah! I don't have enough lives to battle you without the help of Liz's magic, Melvy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I-I'm going back to the ground to wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Heh, heh. You really can't take your eyes off her for a minute, can you? Rebecca, you come along too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Huh? Me, too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You're going to get all stiff doing only desk work. You need to get out and push your body to the limit on occasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Push my body...? What do you mean? What are we going to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Nothing too hard. You're just going to spar with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>That doesn't qualify as a work-out! Last time we fought, I was prepared for death!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Oh? I thought I was holding back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>That's...terrifying. It makes me wonder, though... Why are you always going so far out of your way to train us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Do you have some hidden reason?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Why do you think that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Well...when I asked Her Majesty to allow me to be her apprentice, she accepted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>With her being how she is, I was sure she'd refuse, but she agreed so easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I thought perhaps she had some ulterior motive, but now I don't believe so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>She seems to genuinely want to prepare the next generation, just as you do, Melvy... It seems strange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>We have our reasons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>How about we use this as a learning opportunity! Land a hit on me and I'll tell you the gist of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
