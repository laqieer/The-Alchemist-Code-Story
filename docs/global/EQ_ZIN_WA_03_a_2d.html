<td>001</td>
<td>I'm Sen. Are you a medicine man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes...I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Please...! Save the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Sen, what happened? You have to give me the details for me to understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Okay... My village...there are lots of people...with the same sickness as me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Our village has been making lots of swords from the past...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We are a swordsmith village with much history! My father is a great swordsman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>At this rate...my village...its legacy...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I understand, Sen. Let's go to your village. Where is your village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's further over the mountain...there's a valley...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>H-hey! Sen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Don't worry, she's just sleeping.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see. What a relief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>With the intense fever cause by Demon's Blood, she climbed the mountain and came this far...she must have considerable strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes. All right! Let's go to Sen's village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Are you coming with me? I hear there are a lot of monsters up ahead of this mountain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's a little late for that. Of course, I'm going with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Sen's village has one of this country's notable swordsmiths, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If I can buy myself a Wadatsumi blade, it'll be great for business!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I see. I forgot that you were a carefree merchant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>On my part, I would wish you would spread this medicine for Demon's Blood as soon as possible, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Besides, isn't there a proverb in this country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Like they say... "Wandering roads are the shortest path!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Do you mean, 'Good company is the shortest path'?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Sigh... Fine, fine. Come with me then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'll carry Sen. You protect yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Got it! I won’t get in your way! But just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Protect me if I'm in danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Phew... Mountain roads really are tough. They're a whole other game compared to walking through deserts.<br><br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Would you like to rest a little?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We have a sick person here. Time is of the essence. Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Didn't you say you wouldn't cause problems for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ri-right! I won't! All right, let's hurry! This is nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Don't push yourself! I thought this from when I first met you, but are you from a desert tribe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yeah. I was born in the Desert Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Just as I thought. Now I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hm? Understand what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Those from your land blow like the wind across the desert, untethered to anything, with dry cheer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You are the natural embodiment of your people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The desert tribe originally became nomads in search of water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Besides, with how hot and dry it gets in the desert, you wouldn't survive long if you took everything too seriously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>From the way you speak, you've been there before, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yes. Just for a short period of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It was a good place. They treated outsiders well with kindness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm glad you like it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Right! Didn't you like the food as well? Did you eat the sheep?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes...but I didn't think the sheep tasted very good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I preferred the stewed beans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That, huh? I really don't like stewed beans. What about our wheat noodles?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Noodles? Yeah, they were good. I liked them too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Right?! Ah, all this talk of food is making me hungry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Even when traveling, you never forget the food of home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Heh. That's right. I just got back to Wadatsumi yesterday, and the first thing I ate was rice balls with pickled plum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It was so nostalgic I almost cried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Be careful. There's something there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Is it a mountain monster? That didn't take long...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...It's coming!</td>
</tr>
