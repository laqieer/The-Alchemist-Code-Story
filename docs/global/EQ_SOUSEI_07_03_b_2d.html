<td>Yna</td>
<td>What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>I truly did return to my original form just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>So, I haven't just returned to the past... Just what is happening to my body?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>So, even in such a form as this, the Fallen possess no difficulty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sinner</td>
<td>Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Sadly, we people of Avaritia cannot absorb corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>We are soldiers and smiths. As I seek only strength, there is no point in avoiding sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Heh. If Nimul were to hear me say that, he would scold me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Are you a weaponsmith, my apprentice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Master Roh Ku.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>But all Fallen are naught but weaklings swallowed by sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>No matter how many we cut down, we will never reach that which we are striving for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>All we can do is defend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>So it seems...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Enter now. There's work to be done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Yes, sir.</td>

<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Your iron rings out well today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Hard to believe it's the work of someone who was so cowardly yesterday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Indeed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>I thought you were just a fool with too much talent and too little desire for strength. I must be getting old.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>(I truly was inexperienced at this point. I didn't know the meaning of hammering gear or the intention poured into a blade. I was merely iterating the techniques.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>At this rate, I may just let you take over the workshop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Master, that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Yna, I don't have much time left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>I am a smith, and just as the name implies, I hammered down my soul to make gear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>But that duty will soon come to an end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>I was approached by Lord Kubera.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>He told me to make the Ultimate Blade—one worthy of being the last blade of my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>That's—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>That man has resolved to slay the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>There has never been another warrior to rival him in the history of the Avaritia Belt Region. If one keeps looking for strength, this is the natural result.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Many will die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>If he fails, the Avaritia Belt itself will be destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>And he will still go through with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Do you fear for your sister's life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>I am not condemning you. I hear that kind of strength is also found in other Belts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>But it is not the way of life for we people of Avaritia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>I know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>(But I cannot stop.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>(If this is the trigger of our destruction, then it was the collective will of all those in the Avaritia Belt.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>(My will alone cannot stop this.)</td>
</tr>
