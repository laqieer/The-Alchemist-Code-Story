<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I'm so glad you were with me, Olga. I can't believe we got surrounded like that so quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Heheheh! That was nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Anyway, are you feeling this too? Something seems to be going on over toward the market.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yeah, something is definitely happening in that direction. Let's check it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Shut your trap! You've already paid, so you can't go mouthing off now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What? Come on! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>My products are held in high regard, even among the Holy Guard! You can't blame your lack of sensibility on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I heard something about the Holy Guard! What's happening here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What's with you, woman?! Stay out of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Say that again! You have a problem with me being a woman?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>O-Olga, please... We don't even know the details of the situation yet. Just calm down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A-are you friends with that therian?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, uh, yes. I apologize on Olga's behalf. Do you mind if I ask what happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That merchant! He sold me a knock-off piece of crap!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I spent a fortune on it, and it broke within the day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ha! You were the one that jumped all over the deal, hollering about how it's such a rare item!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hmm... Hey, can I see the bow that you bought?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yeah, sure. It's this one here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What is this?! Even children's toys are built from better material!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The decorations on it are pretty intricate, but they ruin the durability of the bow itself. It's no wonder it broke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hey, hey, hey! You're scaring off my customers! It's his fault for wasting his money!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If you think my product's a sham, then why don't you go and bring me something authentic? You won't find anything but shams and knock-offs in this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Sure, he's the one that chose to buy the bow, but you sold it to him! You have no right to ridicule him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm no merchant, so I can't claim to know how this is supposed to work, but I can tell you that you—and your products—are unreliable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Shut it! You lookin' for a fight?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Olga! Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Aghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Have you no pride? People like you should never deal with weapons ever again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Tch! This isn't over yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Olga, are you hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm fine. I wouldn't let scum like that put a scratch on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Anyway, you don't look like a fighter at all. What were you buying a bow for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I've always wanted to go on an adventure, so I figured I'd need a weapon to take with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>My grandfather travels all over the world, and he always brings home some new story about his adventures. I just had to have one of my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But, I guess I underestimated this world. I couldn't even see through a swindler like him. I should just go back to my village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What? You don't have to give up on your dream over this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No, but I should train myself a little more before going on a journey. I couldn't even handle that spot of trouble without your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I learned a lot today. You're from Saga too, right? I hope to see you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Nothing but shams and knock-offs in this world, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I think you know already since you've been to my village before, Aruba, but there's not a single person there who would deceive another for the sake of making money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yeah, your people don't like to get out much, but they're all nice people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Thank you... But there are other people, it seems, who cherish money over all, and would hurt others for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>To them, that is the right thing to do, and my way of thinking appears to be a sham.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Olga...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I've taken down plenty of bandits in my time, but I suppose even they had their reasons for living the way they do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>My people and I despise Alchemy, and the Holy Guard who bends the laws of nature, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>If I imagine all the people who are saved by these same things, I sometimes lose sight of what truly is important to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Wait, what's going on? Can't I have just one serious moment to myself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hey! You there! You'll pay for what you did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oh, hey. You're that merchant from earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>A Paladin...! There they are! They're the ones who caused trouble at the market! We're so lucky to have you here, Mr. Paladin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What?! Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>So you're the ones illegally causing the drop in value of items at the market?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'll take that as a yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Wh-what the—?! Olga! You can't just let them—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Shut up! Shut up! All of you! Can't you let me think for a second?!</td>
</tr>
