<td>Yeah, something is definitely happening in that direction. Let's check it out!</td>

<td>Shut your trap! You've already paid, so you can't go mouthing off now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traveler</td>
<td>What? Come on! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Merchant A</td>
<td>My products are held in high regard, even among the Holy Guard! You can't blame your lack of sensibility on me!</td>

<td>That merchant! He sold me a knock-off piece of crap!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traveler</td>
<td>I spent a fortune on it, and it broke within the day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ha! You were the one that jumped all over the deal, hollering about how it's such a rare item!</td>

<td>Yeah, sure. It's this one here.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>The decorations on it are pretty intricate, but they ruin the durability of the bow itself. It's no wonder it broke!</td>

<td>Hey, hey, hey! You're scaring off my customers! It's his fault for wasting his money!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>If you think my product's a sham, then why don't you go and bring me something authentic? You won't find anything but shams and knock-offs in this world!</td>

<tr>
<td>Traveler</td>
<td>I've always wanted to go on an adventure, so I figured I'd need a weapon to take with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/olga.png" alt="Olga" height="128"><br>Olga</td>
<td>Huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traveler</td>
<td>My grandfather travels all over the world, and he always brings home some new story about his adventures. I just had to have one of my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traveler</td>
<td>But, I guess I underestimated this world. I couldn't even see through a swindler like him. I should just go back to my village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/olga.png" alt="Olga" height="128"><br>Olga</td>
<td>What? You don't have to give up on your dream over this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traveler</td>
<td>No, but I should train myself a little more before going on a journey. I couldn't even handle that spot of trouble without your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traveler</td>
<td>I learned a lot today. You're from Saga too, right? I hope to see you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/olga.png" alt="Olga" height="128"><br>Olga</td>
<td>Nothing but shams and knock-offs in this world, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/olga.png" alt="Olga" height="128"><br>Olga</td>
<td>I think you know already since you've been to my village before, Aruba, but there's not a single person there who would deceive another for the sake of making money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>Yeah, your people don't like to get out much, but they're all nice people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/olga.png" alt="Olga" height="128"><br>Olga</td>
<td>Thank you... But there are other people, it seems, who cherish money over all, and would hurt others for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/olga.png" alt="Olga" height="128"><br>Olga</td>
<td>To them, that is the right thing to do, and my way of thinking appears to be a sham.</td>

<td>Olga...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/olga.png" alt="Olga" height="128"><br>Olga</td>
<td>I've taken down plenty of bandits in my time, but I suppose even they had their reasons for living the way they do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/olga.png" alt="Olga" height="128"><br>Olga</td>
<td>My people and I despise Alchemy, and the Holy Guard who bends the laws of nature, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/olga.png" alt="Olga" height="128"><br>Olga</td>
<td>If I imagine all the people who are saved by these same things, I sometimes lose sight of what truly is important to me.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Guard Knight</td>
<td>So you're the ones illegally causing the drop in value of items at the market?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/olga.png" alt="Olga" height="128"><br>Olga</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
