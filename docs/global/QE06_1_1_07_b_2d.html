<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Nngh! Still not good enough! Then let us try this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Take this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Amane? Hey, Amane!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Urgh! I can do better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Amane!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Waah!!! You scared me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Geez, did you have to yell like that?! You scared me right back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What are you even doing in there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Just some training, but...wh-what are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You haven't eaten yet, have you? Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I-is that—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Celis's meatballs. I think these were her best ones yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>They're good! So good! These are the greatest meatballs ever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Are you even listening to me? You can be such a pig sometimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wait, should you even be doing this? Is sharing food with people in the brig not against regulations?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm not sharing food, I'm just celebrating. So no, I'm not breaking any rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Celebrating?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Congratulations, Amane. Welcome to the Blade Fox Corps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Haha... Hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wh-what's so funny?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So you're celebrating with me, not sharing food... Hahaha, that's some excuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Still... Thank you, Azami.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>To be honest, I didn't think you'd pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Would it have been better if I'd failed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Seriously?! Can't you at least cushion your words a bit? I do have feelings too, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Well, now I'll have to worry for your life every day. I mean, we're not even in the same squad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You'd worry for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Of course. It's my responsibility as an older sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Azami!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hey, ow! Let go! Aw, you got snot on me! I said let go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Did you really have to cry over this? You can be so dramatic sometimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I just... We haven't been able t-to really talk since I g-got here, so I was so scared th-that you...that you might've changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What are you talking about? I would never change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You're my little sister, ever since we made that promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Father... Mother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(A voice...? From inside the well?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Is someone in there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Aaaahh.... Aaah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wait, hold on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(It's old, but this rope should work!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Grab on to this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Urk! Just...a little more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Urgh! Don't you let go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huff...huff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Th-thank you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>How long were you in that well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Are you alone too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I see. You're just like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I was just running... Trying to get away. Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Ah! Over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Grrraaaaaarrrrrgghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Waah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>A-are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Wh-why did you save me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Grrraahgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Ack...ahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Huff...huff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Y-you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Sorry. I lost my sword. This might be it. We can run, but it'll find us in no time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Why are you still helping me? You could run off on your own and save yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Probably because I don't want to be alone anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You came this far all alone too, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Can I hold your hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>There, now we're not alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>It'd be too tragic if we had everything taken from us, and we also had to die alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>It's...so warm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Your hands... It's nice not to be alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I'm Azami. What's your name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Do you mind if I ask for something selfish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Would it be alright with you, Amane, if we stayed together as sisters? At least until we die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I think that way we'd feel a lot less lonely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Better to be with your sister than a stranger. A little less...cold, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Yeah... Okay. I want to be warm too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Thanks, Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ahahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Silly. People can't help but get hungry, even in times like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Hahaha, yeah. Silly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>N-nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>(What...was that? Visions of things I've never seen before...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Finally. I found you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Who...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Such a damn hassle. But you're the last one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Urgh... Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Hmph, can't even fight back properly anymore, huh? You filthy Kagomurasaki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>This is the end for you. I've devoured the entirety of your clan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>What...?! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi, Sumeragi, and Kagutsuchi... The Sacred Three of Wadatsumi and one more... The Kagomurasaki's powers which stand against us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Destroy these and there will be none left to impede our way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You are all that's left. Your clan will be no more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Huzzaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>How futile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Have you gone mad? Are you not afraid? Are you not dismayed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Of course I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>But I'm still going to laugh at you! I'm going to laugh away what you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I mean, a demon like you, being laughed at by a mere child. How absurd!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>A demon so absurd will surely be vanquished soon! That's what I'm going to believe, and you can't stop me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Incomprehensible. What makes you think any of that childish blather made any sense?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Azami...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Don't worry. There's nothing to fear. We're not alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Indeed, you are not alone. Your entire clan is waiting for you on the other side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Urgh...! Father... Mother... Hrk! Uhhnn!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I won't let you demons win... We will not lose to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Even if I die here, someone will surely...! Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I... I can't die without doing anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>This is all wrong! It's not right! This is... It's too sad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>It's... It's too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>You let me be your little sister! Then as your sister, I have to help you when you need me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I can't stand around and do nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Amane!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Do not worry. You will be together...for I will devour you both.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>(Are we...going to die here?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>(This isn't...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>"The demon is devouring..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>"This is all wrong! It's not right! This is... It's too sad!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>"I have to fight against this!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
