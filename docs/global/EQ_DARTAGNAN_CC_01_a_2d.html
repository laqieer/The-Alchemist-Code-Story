<td>Hyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well done, you two! I can hardly believe you're new recruits!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes. Very impressive. As expected of therians.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hehe! I'm pretty confident in my war dancing skills. We work pretty well together, don't you think, Yura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Let's protect Envylia together, as therians!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yeah! I'll do my best to make sure I can fight at your side, D'Artagnan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Sigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I can't believe the captain's making me do war dancing with D'Artagnan at the parade...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The captain's orders are the captain's orders, but we're not like we were back then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>D'Artagnan is an incredible knight who would do just fine on her own. Me, on the other hand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I gotta stop thinking like that. I need to go on my patrol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hello, sir. Ma'am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh, Yura! On patrol? You're a hard worker as always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hello, Yura. It must be tough patrolling this whole area, especially with all of the new therians in the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Right... There are quite a few here now who moved to Envylia relatively recently. It's a nice place to live for therians.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But it's important to make sure everyone is safe when the number of people increases like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You've become such a wonderful knight, Yura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Have you noticed any unusual changes in the forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Unusual changes? Now that you mention it, there's a strange human that has been wandering around outside the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>A strange human?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>They haven't actually done anything, but... It's a little scary. There's stories of children being kidnapped in other villages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes... We've yet to have any incidents here, but people are starting to worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Therians may be strong, but against a big group... We're just as defenseless as anyone else. Just like back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Nnf, let go of me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What happened to all that bravery from before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Listen up, therians! Resist and the kid dies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Your blood will be used well. Now, follow what we say orâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>How interesting. How exactly were you planning on using the blood of therians?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm sorry... It was my fault for trying to do everything myself like a fool... I got caught and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It wasn't your fault. All you did was try to save the children who were in danger of being taken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's right. It's those humans' fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Because of them, we had to leave our home and come here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I know you're a knight of Envylia now, but I... I just can't trust humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm thankful that Envylia has allowed us to live in the forest, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's okay, I understand how you both feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Excuse me, I'm going to go check something real quick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Who is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>They're...looking into the village? But why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>A knight on patrol? No matter. It's only one. Kill them.</td>
