<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Hazel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm getting pretty used to these prosthetics. I can fight again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But why? Why do you still want to return to the battlefield? You were so badly hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Half of your body was blown off. You could have died!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I've been prepared for that since the moment I became a mercenary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Are you not afraid? The battlefield is... I'm just so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'd be lying if I said I'm not afraid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Still... I'm more afraid of failing to protect a friend. I'm glad you're okay, Evelika.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The sky... It's so gloomy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It is. The clouds look so heavy and dark... They're making me feel gloomy too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You know, there's a beautiful moon beyond those clouds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Just as the moon still glows behind that curtain of clouds, I won't give up as long as my hope hasn't faded away. Even during this dark time when I must confront the adversity of my injuries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're so strong, Hazel. I can never be like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I can't see anything beyond those clouds, but you make me want to believe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If the sky ever clears, I would like to see the moon with you, Hazel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That would be nice. Someday...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(I was really looking forward to this. That promise we made was the one thing that kept me going.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(But maybe I was the only one that thought of it as a promise.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The moon... It's already so high up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I wonder why... I was so looking forward to this, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I can't bring myself to think it's beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Evelika...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Tamamo...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm sorry! I really wanted to do this so badly, I was getting carried away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Moon-gazing is a human thing. We used to just watch from afar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But my friend that taught me about moon-gazing, Mikoto, said she'd never done this either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I am sure that everyone will enjoy this day in harmony, united under the majesty of the full moon. I cannot deny that I am a little envious. I would very much like to enjoy it alongside them, but alas...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Okay! Then I promise you that we'll go moon-gazing together someday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Mikoto grew up in the shrine alone, so she never had the chance to enjoy events and get-togethers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So I wanted to have everything made ready and bring her down to surprise her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>When I mentioned it, Hazel said she'd like to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hazel did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>She said she wanted to do something to welcome you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I think Evelika is troubled over me being summoned with my prosthetics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It reminds her that she made me take the more dangerous route while keeping herself safe. Even though I've never thought of it that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>She won't say, but I get it. She's the kind of girl that tries to shoulder burdens all on her own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But it'll be such a waste of a clear sky to have that weighing over her mind, forcing her to hang her head down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hazel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Evelika...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Um, I'm... I'm sorry, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You know, I'm really enjoying tonight! I mean, we had fun together back then, too! I just want you to know, I have no regrets!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I think you can tell if I'm lying or not, right, Evelika? What do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I...don't think you're lying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So you have nothing to worry about! Understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Y-yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Chestnuts, pumpkins, and potatoes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>A feast full of seasonal dishes. Carol cooked all of this for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>So, let's finish getting ready for the moon-gazing! Together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>All right! Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Dumplings, ready! Feast, ready! Silver grass, re...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Crap! They're back! Run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Th-those men, they had our silver grass! They're getting away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Is this... Is this a good fortune thing too? Are they allowed to take silver grass like the dumplings?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Uhm... What do you think, Tamamo?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Probably not. So... Come back here!</td>
</tr>
