<td>The 11th Lord Commander, Kanon... So she's your friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes, she's the one who saved me from loneliness. My only friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>She kept her promise. She came here to visit me again shortly after.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We talked so much that I can't even remember all that we talked about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>For someone like me, who didn't know anything but that cramped space... Kanon's stories opened up the world for a brief moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Each time, we spoke about everything under the sun while drinking tea. During those times, my loneliness wasn't so noticeable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Thinking back now, it was right after she took over as Lord Commander, so things must have been very difficult for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Lord Zain had died, and though she had friends to help her along the way, the burden of upholding justice on the continent fell to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Still, she was always smiling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Her smiles weren't even forced. I could tell. She smiled because she was genuinely enjoying our time together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>She taught me what friendship really was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And before I knew it, my loneliness was gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Her smile filled that emptiness inside me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>She's a really important person to you, isn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes, very.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But we were forced to go our separate ways, quite suddenly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Lakina, are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm all right! There are just too many...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's just like you said. There definitely is someone out there after you, or Lucifer, rather.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So it's not unrelated to that, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Did something happen outside?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The Lion Monarch's Charge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'll explain later. First, we need to take care of the enemy before us!</td>
