<td>Before the two had realized it, food became the bridge that connected humans and demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>They both realized, even if subconsciously, that their futures were intertwined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>And they set about changing the minds of their respective races--in alignment with their cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The human expressed his resolve to his queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It would have been simple enough to appeal to her emotions, but he did not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>"A path exists in which we don't need to fight demons."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>"If we provide food that demons can eat, they won't need to attack humans anymore. And I've developed such food."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The queen stated, "I need to see it with my own eyes before I believe you."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So the human spoke again, choosing his words carefully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>"I'll show you proof."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>"If I'm lying, you can have my head."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The demon declared her resolve to her brother, in addition to recounting everything that had taken place until that point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Facts alone weren't enough to convince him, so she appealed to his emotions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>"I've discovered food that I can eat."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>"You can finally be relieved of the burden you've carried."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>"And I can live the 'normal' life I've been hoping for."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The demon chief posed a question:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>"Of what food do you speak, exactly?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The demon steeled herself and choose her words carefully:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>"We can survive without devouring humans--no one need starve. We can finally live in peace."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>"And what if peace never comes to pass?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>"Then I will gladly offer my head."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>"Is there some form of proof you can show me?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The brother asked his sister:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>"Why should demons join forces with humans when they show us nothing but contempt?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The demon asserted to her brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>"There are some humans who show us compassion."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Her brother spoke deliberately, making the demon second-guess herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>"Devouring humans is what demons do."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The demon chose her words carefully, in the hopes of reaching her brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>"If so, then I don't need to be a demon. I have faith in a better future."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>And so, for the first time, humans and demons…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Communicated without violence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We've never done this before…without weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I trust you'll exercise restraint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm not here to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Nor am I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…It's an honor to have you both join us on this occasion. I hope you'll listen to what we have to say…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Let's cut the formalities and lay it all out--plain and simple!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wha--Koga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>No point using flowery language if it doesn't strike a chord! The point is, let's end the fighting. That's it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>…You must be Koga. Your reputation precedes you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Surely you didn't invite us here to make such a ludicrous demand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I sure did! I believe food can change the world! Eliminate hunger and we can bring about world peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>My brethren cannot survive without devouring humans. Given that fact, how can we take you seriously?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Of course I know that! I'm sure there will be naysayers and skeptics--all that jazz. But first…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Just try my food and then we'll talk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>…I am a demon that can't devour humans…but thanks to Koga's dishes--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...I finally have an alternative.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>When you think about it, humans and demons fight because demons need to devour humans to survive, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Therefore--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>All we need to do to prevent more fighting is provide an alternate nutrition source!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>…Do you have any proof that other demons can eat this new cuisine you've created?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'm gonna have them taste test right after this--Bada bing bada boom--Instant results!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…Hmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Intriguing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>…You can't be serious…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Nevertheless, a simple taste test can't erase generations' worth of enmity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>…How will you address those concerns?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>All that's water under the bridge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Wha--?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Both sides are sick and tired of the endless violence. Let's use this chance to put an end to it all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Humans and demons can meet each other halfway! Me and Kaede did it! So, why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I cannot commit to any agreement without proof. I have a duty to uphold as leader.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I must admit, I agree with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Kaede…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Humans, demons--What does it matter who joins you at the dinner table, as long as you're enjoying it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>…Right. So, in that vein…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What--! Do you have any idea what you're doing!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>…Kaede!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>From now on, I will live my life as a human. These broken horns symbolize my commitment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You would forsake your life as a demon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yes. Because of what Koga has taught me--not about bringing together demons and humans, but about living together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>His resolve has compelled me to match his. I want to place my bets on the future of Wadatsumi that he envisions…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>"If so, then I don't need to be a demon. I have faith in a better future."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>…Kaede!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>But I don't think I can do it with willpower alone…Still, I know I've got to show something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I hope, somehow, you'll be able to see my resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Well said Kaede! I guess I should prove my resolve by becoming a demon--Wait, is that even possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Should I…grow horns?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Pff--Hahahaha!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>It's alright, Koga. Kaede's gesture is enough for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Mitsuha…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Demon chief, I have verily accepted this gesture of goodwill. We humans must offer something in kind… Therefore--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>In response to Kaede, I will disband the Phoenix Brigade under my command and dissolve the Phoenix Covenant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Our art, namely the arcane art of Kagutsuchi, is henceforth forbidden. What say you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>…Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>It's only human nature to want to reciprocate a gesture made in good faith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>What use do we have of our art if demons no longer pose a threat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I hereby forbid the use of the arcane art, Kagutsuchi--inherited from my forefathers-- provided that our reconciliation remains intact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>How does that sit with you? There is nothing more I can offer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>…Hmm. You'd do away with the your demon-slaying arts? Quite a handsome proposal, indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>But words alone aren't enough for me to trust you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Then, allow me to prove myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I, having entered a covenant with thee--based on the blood pact of the Aquila Rubrum--hereby nullify all covenants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>In order to enter a new covenant, the blood of the royal family must be spilled. Without it, there will be nothing. All is in the name of Aquila Rubrum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...Huzzaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Let us show proof. Someone step forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>As you can see, Kagutsuchi cannot be wielded any longer. Henceforth…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>My blood will be necessary to enact the Phoenix Covenant. So long as there is no cause for bloodshed…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>…The seal will not be broken. I see. Your actions are compelling. All that remains is…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Whether or not this man's "food" is up to snuff. Can we demons consume it and be satisfied…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>There's still room for improvement, but I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by his skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Alright, let's save the details for later! We're all equal in the eyes of chow…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>If you can't stomach it, I'm ready to lay my life on the line. Just try it first and then we'll talk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>For the first time in Wadatsumi history, humans and demons will dine together. Let the feast begin!</td>
</tr>
