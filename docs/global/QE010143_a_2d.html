<td>Father...no...traitor! I've found you! I'm going to protect Agatha and Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You? It would be a stain on Envylia's reputation if they were protected by someone who's dirtied his hands in darkness.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Sabareta!</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm in no position to judge others, but at least I'm well aware of the fact that I'm evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You know of my power of darkness...and yet you still challenge me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Pretty much. In any case, you're someone that needs to be dealt with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You idiot... Protecting Agatha comes first. I'll take care of you later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, well. Who would've thought brothers could be so different? Although both have their faults...when it comes to a talent for leadership, that naive kid's got the upper hand.</td>

<td>What?</td>

<td>At least he knows better than to quickly resort to force. Power alone won't allow you to capture people's hearts, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You seem to be overly confident in your own power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Don't be foolish. How can I be overly confident when my opponent wields the power of darkness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No. I'm gonna come at you with everything I've got.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh?! A Demon...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This Demon is slightly different than the one you defeated. After all, this one's source of power is me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Did you think I'd come empty-handed? It's common courtesy to save the best for last.</td>
