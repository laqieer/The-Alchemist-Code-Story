<td>I've managed to complete inherit the Kagutsuchi. Does this mean training is complete?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. You did well. And I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Although the point was to push you to the edge, I sent out that one blow truly with the intention of killing you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You managed to accomplish this intensive training. I promise to repay you on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh, that? Don't worry about it. We were both giving it our all after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I see. Once again, I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That being said, your completed Kagutsuchi is truly stunning in its impact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It almost transformed into something beyond a Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The legendary Kagutsuchi Kiraboshi that was in the literature must have been this technique.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Kagutsuchi Kiraboshi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Perhaps it is due to the aptitude of your Alchemia...as well as your feelings towards Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ku-Kudan...?! Please, don't joke like that, Lord Zain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hm? Did I hear you incorrectly? I thought I heard you say you want to rescue Kudan from the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Most likely, without knowing it, you had placed a lid on the large vessel of Alchemia within you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Perhaps it was simply due to fear of its enormous force or because you were afraid of controlling it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>In either case, by clearing your heart, you were able to remove that lid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's none other than your role to rescue Kudan from the darkness. Perhaps you had resolved yourself to that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You might be right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Until now, I have unknowingly been relying on Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I may have been relying on him to have power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>However...that's over now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>At that moment, I had thought clearly that I could not allow Kudan to get close to power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Heh. Power to distance him from power, huh? Make him feel the fear of power. That sounds like the kind of thing you'd come up with, Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That being said, since he's a prisoner to power right now, in order to save him, it may not be enough to fight his power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If Kudan were to witness the great power of the Mikaboshi in that fateful land of Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Like the heroes of old, I feel like he won't be able to return anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes. Besides, there are many others who are after the power of the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If possible, we'd like to desperately avoid fighting with them, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Word of such fights must not, under any circumstances, reach Kudan's ears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes. I will distance Kudan from power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well then, let's hurry and go blow up that Mikaboshi! We can use Lord Zain's Excalibur and my...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Perfect timing! I'll make you watch the rebirth of my power until you get sick of it!</td>
