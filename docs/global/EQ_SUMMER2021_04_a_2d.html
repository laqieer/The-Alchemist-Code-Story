<td>Have at you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Damn... I thought with my experience in battle I could handle these ink-spitters! But with this many...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I can't fight them all alone. Things are getting out of hand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ah! Nefertiti!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(We have to help her! But if I fire from here...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(There's too great of a chance it might hit her. What do I do?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(Nefertiti is strong, though. Maybe she'll be fine on her own...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Su Yi! Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes... S-Sorry, Shenmei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's fine! It's fine! What's important is you want to help Nefertiti, right? I got the octopuses. You focus on that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I know you can do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>O-Okay! I know what to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Nefertiti! Stay right there! Don't move! ...Eeeyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>She's scaring off the octopuses!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(She fired the cannon far enough away for me to be safe, but close enough to drive them away!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well done, Xiao-Xiao! I can take care of the rest. I'll have these filleted in three seconds! Yo ho!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Nefertiti, are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes, I'm fine. Thanks to Su Yi. Thank you for saving me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh! I'm just glad you're all right! I was worried my plan might not work...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But Shenmei gave me the courage to do what I needed to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If that should happen again, holler our way. You had us worried!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm sorry I caused you concern. I should've taken into account my unfamiliarity with the environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I thought I wouldn't have a problem with that number, however...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Of course, you'd probably be fine taking on something like octopuses on your own, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Even when you think you can deal with someone alone, you can still depend on us to help! We're in this together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Depend on you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I understand. As a leader who likes to take control, I hadn't thought of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oof, when you put it that way, I'm sure it seems like I rely on others way too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I couldn't even assess things ahead of time to help everyone avoid danger the way you could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But I guess that's why everyone works so hard. It makes up for me being unreliable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's not quite correct...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Our captain may be a bit overly spirited, and also take the lead despite having no sense of north.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>However, no matter what we face, no matter how dangerous, she never backs down and protects everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>She trusts her friends more than anyone and keeps them safe. When I see her act that way, naturally I want to help any way I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Liu Shen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's right. You're not unreliable, Shenmei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Whenever you tell me it's going to be okay, I believe you, and it gives me courage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>When the way out of that cave was blocked, she told us with a smile we'd figure it out and be all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>She took the lead to find another path and fought past the demons that blocked the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>She said that no matter what happened, she would be first to face whatever came.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>She always makes me want to be better and try hard... I know that whatever happens, we'll come out of it okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Su Yi...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You really feel that way? Thank you! You've made me so happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Sh-Shenmei! Y-You're sort of squishing me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You're right... We've been through so much, and there's a lot I could've done better...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But we've always had fun! The best moments of my life have been with this trusting family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I feel I owe you an apology for dragging you into this motley crew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Let me assure you that you don't. Seeing the wonderful relationship you share has deeply moved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The magic of your partnership comes by way of all the things you contribute sandwiched together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...I suppose that's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Of course, Xiao-Xiao's way of doing things wouldn't work just anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Indeed... I would not have been able to be like her in my prior position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>But I still think it's fantastic that there is a leader like her. That there can be leaders like her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I believe the reason this all works at all is because of the energy you all share.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I think the best thing is if we can all take strength from her and how she approaches things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>(But it is true... I would struggle to be like her given my circumstances.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Still, though! I want to be able to help my older sister more! I know I'm the unworthy younger brother, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I want you to count on me... And I want to help you! If nothing else, it can only make things better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>(Perhaps, if I'd let him help out a little more... Maybe I could've spared Ramses from what was to come his way.)</td>
</tr>
