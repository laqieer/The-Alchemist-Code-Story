<td>Huff...huff... This is tough. Hey, Seida, is it really a shortcut to go through this mountain path?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I can sense the 4th Regiment spread out on the other side of this hill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It'll save us a lot of time to cut across the hill than to make our way around it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Besides, there are much fewer monsters. Isn't that right, Almira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, right! It's true that there's a wide plain on the other side of this hill, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No, I was just impressed that you knew about it! I guess I should expect that much from my teacher!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, it's true. You seem to know a lot about this area, Seida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Seriously? You trained together and you don't know? Seida is originally from Saga. This prairie is practically her backyard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What?! I had no idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Neither did I! I wonder if we've met somewhere before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I doubt it. That was a long time ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, but wait. Does that mean you're also from one of the equestrian tribes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes. I'm from one of the equestrian tribes. What about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What about it? You're my friend. I want to know these things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's irrelevant. This is the past I've abandoned long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Vice-Captain, no more unnecessary comments, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I told you about it because I thought it would be necessary for this expedition, but it's the past that I wish to forget.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Shouldn't you value your homeland?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I don't know what happened, but your homeland is where you began and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If you don't know what happened, then it would be more efficient if you kept your mouth shut.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...What's that?</td>
