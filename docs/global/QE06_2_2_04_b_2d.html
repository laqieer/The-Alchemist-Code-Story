<td>I don't…believe it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Just a bit longer. It's almost ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>…Why are you doing this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>A deal's a deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>…Yes, but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Just be patient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…Pft.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're not really good at fighting, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…How dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Your opening moves are amateurish. Your attacks are weak…and you're too kindhearted to take someone's life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Now when you start rampaging, that's a different story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I was joking. Forget I said anything. As for me, I'm happy as long as I can cook.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>…Do you live alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yep. My parents were devoured by demons when I was a kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wait! Hang on! …I won't hold it against you. Sit back down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>…Oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Demons have to eat to survive. We humans eat other living things to survive, too. It's all the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, at the time, I held a grudge against you guys, but then I thought:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>"Who's to say that animals and monsters and nature don't resent me?" So, I stopped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It ain't easy being without food. To eat is to live, y'know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Didn't I tell you, "Eat to live, not live to eat?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…Why...are you--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There's no life on earth that wants to die. That's why we eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I probably wouldn't have made it this far if I thought otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>…I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>…That reminds me! Hahaha! I never got your name! Would you mind introducing yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…I'm Kaede.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Kaede, is it? Has a nice ring to it. To new friendships, Kaede!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>…You're a strange man. I might devour you right here. You know that, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's fine. We made a promise. I'm just happy you to kept it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>…! Well, that's because…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>There must be some reason you need to devour humans, even though it seems you can't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>So, you should just do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hahahahaha! Sorry, I bet it's easier said than done...but I'm sure you won't eat me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…What makes you so sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You know my name. And I know yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You can't eat something if you know its name…That tends to be the case, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But if you've got to eat to live, then I don't mind going out like that. Can't really blame you, can I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Still, a gentle soul like yours surely needs good cooking to live a normal, quiet life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>…!? Why do you say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's hard to fight when you're full!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Oh, sorry!! Did I same something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>N-No. I…I'm--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I see… So that's how it is…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>…Humans are cruel. They don't care about life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>And... I'm not "normal." I have a power I can't control. I fainted suddenly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>…Like when you're rampaging?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>My brother tries to help me live a "normal" life. So, I--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>So, that's why you want to devour me, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>All I can say is... I give thanks for the life I take. I won't take anything from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>And what I can do now is…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Fill your stomach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>…Forgive me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The reason you had to suffer like that--it may have been my fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You? How could that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>…It's a long story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>What I'm about to tell you is a story from my past.</td>
