<td>Thank you! I knew we could count on you!</td>

<td>Right, the exit's close!</td>

<td>007</td>
<td>(The Jam are practically immune to standard weapons. We'll need to come up with some sort of countermeasure.)</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Come to think of it, there was something about that factory that kept the Jam away.</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What could it have been?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Are we at the outskirts of the city?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We are. This should be far enough toâ€”</td>

<td>Grrrrrrr...</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Eek! The Jam are out here, too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We have to run away!</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>

<tr>

<td>(I've exhausted myself! I don't know how long I'd be able to hold them off!)</td>

<td>017</td>
<td>Take that!</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Grrraaarrr?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Some of the powdered lime from the factory! I figured it'll at least make a smoke screen!</td>

<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Glurrrrrp?! Grrraaaaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I-it's running away.</td>

<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Could it be?</td>

<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The difference in how fast they multiply between here and Saga... The fact that they slow down in the desert... That "Wind" Ouija purifies them...</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I have it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>M-mister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I was a fool! How did I not realize this sooner?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We could be rid of the Jam even without the power of purification!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You okay? You didn't hit your head there, did you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I thank you. You've brought us all hope!</td>

<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We must find the Liberation Army, but first...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'll lead you two to a town near by. Follow me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Thank you so much. Heheh. You finally smiled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm saying that you look better with a smile on. I'm glad I was able to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I know this isn't something you want to hear from someone who has lived peacefully in the capital all this time, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Please, save this country. I've seen enough tragedy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I will.</td>
