<td>My father despises demi-humans...as well as the Shield Hero. But the king and Heroes should be working together, not fighting among themselves.</td>

<td>After some deliberating, my mother ordered me to hurry back to the kingdom and admonish the king for encouraging such unjust hatred to flourish.</td>

<td>Indeed... It must feel disheartening when no one trusts you..</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Melty Q Melromarc</td>
<td>I already know what that feels like. I don't think I could handle it if I had to do it all alone...</td>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Melty Q Melromarc</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/anas.png" alt="Anastasia" height="128"><br>Anastasia</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Melty Q Melromarc</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/anas.png" alt="Anastasia" height="128"><br>Anastasia</td>
<td>So the fact that you are working so hard to take responsibility as your kingdom's princess makes me want the best for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/anas.png" alt="Anastasia" height="128"><br>Anastasia</td>
<td>At the same time, I'm also rather concerned for you... You shouldn't feel obligated to handle all of this on your own.</td>

<td>Thank you for your kind words, Miss Anastasia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>W-what?! That is absolutely not true...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/anas.png" alt="Anastasia" height="128"><br>Anastasia</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/anas.png" alt="Anastasia" height="128"><br>Anastasia</td>
<td>(All that worry and confusion... I wonder if she was plagued by the same as she tried to do what was best for Wratharis? My queen was still but a child...)</td>

<td>What is that thing? I've never seen a monster like that before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lami.png" alt="Lamia" height="128"><br>Lamia</td>
<td>These are the monsters of our world. ...They appear to be pretty agitated. Are they being affected by the Wave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sb_naof.png" alt="Naofumi Iwatani" height="128"><br>Naofumi Iwatani</td>
