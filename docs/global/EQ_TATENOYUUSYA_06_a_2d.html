<td>(Raphtalia, Filo... Where are you two?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Say, Melty, aren't you a princess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Er, yes, I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You said people are out to get you back in your world... May I ask what happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I see... I had no idea that you went through so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>My father despises demi-humans...as well as the Shield Hero. But the king and Heroes should be working together, not fighting among themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>After some deliberating, my mother ordered me to hurry back to the kingdom and admonish the king for encouraging such unjust hatred to flourish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's why I want Father and the Shield Hero to reconcile their differences. I just need to get them to speak with one another...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And yet, the knights of Melromarc turned their swords on me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The knights did...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Naofumi ended up saving me, but ended up being wanted for kidnapping the princess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I swear, no one in charge of Melromarc is worth anything. Not even their king nor that other princess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>H-how can you even say that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why do bother defending them? Your blood sister tried to kill you for the crown, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh... Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>They didn't believe a word you said and blindly followed your sister, right? They'll never change. They acted the same to me, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's why we can't trust anyone from your kingdom. Especially your poor excuse of a father—the king who tried to execute his own daughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Father never attempted to do such a thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's true that those were my father's men, but they were just listening to my sister's orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No matter who told them to do it, it doesn't change the fact that knights of the Melromarc Kingdom were out for your head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>On top of that—those knights took orders from someone besides the king? Your kingdom's got a lot of issues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hey... You didn't have to go that far...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You have no right to butt in when you don't even know the entire situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And just for the record—Melty's father is the one who messed with me first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That may be true, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Sorry, but we're going to need you to leave this argument back in your world to deal with later. You're not going to resolve that while you're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We need to focus on looking for your pals right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You're right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You're a hardheaded one, Naofumi. But I suppose I don't blame you for feeling that way if what you claim is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Still, if you keep pushing others away, no one will ever come close to truly understanding you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Indeed... It must feel disheartening when no one trusts you..</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I already know what that feels like. I don't think I could handle it if I had to do it all alone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But even so... The king and Heroes need to work together...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Melty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That is why as our kingdom's princess, I must get the Shield Hero and the king to put aside their differences and join forces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Mother's putting all of her trust in me to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Don't push yourself too hard, Melty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Trying to solve everything on your own can be too much to bear sometimes. I should know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Although that's easier said than done. I'm sure it's not easy being part of the royal family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>As someone with so much power, you need to take into consideration not only yours, but the wellbeing of your people, as well. That is the responsibility of any leader.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm not of royal blood... But I have protected them, so I have an idea of the amount of responsibility that they must bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>So the fact that you are working so hard to take responsibility as your kingdom's princess makes me want the best for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>At the same time, I'm also rather concerned for you... You shouldn't feel obligated to handle all of this on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Thank you for your kind words, Miss Anastasia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>But this is merely my responsibility as a princess of the kingdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I need to accomplish what mother expects from me... And as the future queen, I need to do everything in my power to save my kingdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>So please, don't worry about me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Just as stubborn as Naofumi, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>W-what?! That is absolutely not true...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(I wonder if a certain someone that I know will also worry her head off just like this one here once she becomes queen...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>(All that worry and confusion... I wonder if she was plagued by the same as she tried to do what was best for Wratharis? My queen was still but a child...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I heard something just now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>H-heeelp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What is that thing? I've never seen a monster like that before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>These are the monsters of our world. ...They appear to be pretty agitated. Are they being affected by the Wave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Who knows... Whatever the case, we need to help that guy out right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You're going to help him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What kind of Hero would I be if I didn't help someone in need?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I guess you're right...</td>
</tr>
