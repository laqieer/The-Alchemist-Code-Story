<td>We needed battle power, didn't we? Why don't we take these girls home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Go home, right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>They can talk?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Hell yes! Just as I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>They'll be our instant, immediate, right now firepower! An elite team of kunoichi who love me without question!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I'm in lurve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Foolish, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm gonna take you home with me, Ragi-Boo.</td>
</tr>

<td>What...is going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wh-what in blazes...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Isn't that the girl who was with that giant monster?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wanna fall...in lurve.</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>H-hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Don't care with who! Just wanna fall in lurve, normal love, be a normal girl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So...shameless.</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I have heard of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh? R-really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There was one in my world who served my master alongside me; one of the Dark Killers. She was dressed just like this girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>To be clear, she was not like that brazen group of clones, but rather resembled this sensible Hiiragi here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Her name was Masamune, and this phenomenon...is a ninja technique!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Way of the Ninja—Shadow Clone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Sh-shadow clone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I have heard that it is a terrible and powerful technique. It creates countless duplicates, each terrifying in their aspect! All of you must flee at once. Quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>C-countless duplicates?! That's...! Why, that's 'orrifying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Run! Run for yer lives! The Shadow Clones'll have yer bones!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Now love! Now love! Now love! Now love! Now love! Now love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Now love! Now love! Now love! Now love! Now love! Now love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh, brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh! S-stop it! Stop it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Without a doubt! Now love! Wanna fall in lurve! Without a doubt! Now love! Wanna fall in lurve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>At least their vocabulary is increasing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>S-stop it! Stop talking like that! N-not when you look like me! I'm going to die of embarrassment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I never feel up to anything until after the sun goes down, myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I know that voice. That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It is only when night has fallen that I feel ready to unleash my powers to their fullest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Do you know her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>She's an ancient samurai! I summoned her once before, and she lent me her powers. How did you get here, Yomi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I was here first, you know, but the sun was still high in the sky, so I didn't want to move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I didn't expect things to get so...chaotic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Just normally! Now lurve! Want a lover! Anyone! Don't care who! Want a lover!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>This is absurd. Utterly absurd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I can't take much more of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hiiragi... How inelegant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>N-no! It's n-not me! You're wrong! I'm not like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I know. It was just a little joke. I've lived a long time. Such things are obvious to one such as I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'll bite...! How old are you, Yomi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>According to my estimations, that... Hmm... For convenience's sake, let us call them a stampede of Hiiragi—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Don't ignore me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I am a girl of seven years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What the—?! You're younger than me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>As I was saying... That stampede of Hiiragi is likely an aggregation of the postmortem regrets of the original individual, twisted and corrupted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Let me love you! Let me be normal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>P-postmortem...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hiiragi has died once in her world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It's already so late, at this point, I don't care who I date!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What? She looks pretty alive to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>She broke the Kunoichi Code which forbade romance, and was sent to the underworld. She was ostensibly revived, however, thanks to the efforts of her friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yet, unbeknownst to her, Hiiragi had brought with her a plethora of corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Thanks to the meddling of you twins, Hiiragi's corrupt regrets became muddled with otherworldly powers and desires, and were made manifest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The fact that she was unable to fully cleanse herself in the hot spring before she was dragged into this mess is likely part of the problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'm gonna fall in love, just normal love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Even I, a samurai, would have to say that I am heavily influenced by desire and corruption. Yet that is why I was able to realize all of this and avoid being wholly drawn into this turmoil myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Accordingly, it is plain to me that these foolish ramblings are not truly reflective of Hiiragi's innermost desires, but are instead twisted and corrupted versions of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hmm... I have lain underneath the warm sun for too long today. I feel rather dizzy... You will have to clean this mess up by yourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What?! No! Yomi, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Come here, Ragi-Boo. You can fall for me; I'll catch you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Lurve...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>This isn't me! This isn't how I feel! S-stop using my face like this! I'm going to die of embarrassment! I'm going to die...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Right?! Now you see why I went on that rampage back there! I couldn't stand it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hiiragi... Mira... I owe you both thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You snide little brat! Come here, I'll wipe that smirk off your face for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>From our first battle with the Lovesickness, I understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Nyx, you pervert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Ooooooooraaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Huh?! What was that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Can't you hear that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Ooooooooraaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I knew it. That thing sure is persistent...and loud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I perceived a whirl of voices around the creature, and slowed time down so that I could listen to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I heard snatches of things like "I want to fall in love" and "I want to be a normal girl."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>These are things that you desired, aren't they? I granted you your wish! And then what happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>The Lovesickness sought me out and manifested, like this, for me! Now I don't need you anymore, Hiiragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Wh-what? B-but...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>I hate talkative girls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>H-huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Besides, better to be loved by some than one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Chicks love the mother who feeds them their first mouthful, don't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>When I saw the Lovesickness, I realized that in the near future this composite body, a concentration of her innermost thoughts and feelings, would come to imitate the kunoichi herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>So I considered what I could feed her, and endeavored to have her imprint her love onto me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>I found myself fantasizing... Ooh, I could make my very own harem! I could have girls wait on me hand and foot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Why you little...! Nyx! I don't remember raising you to be such a slovenly pervert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Eheheh! Ohh, Ragi-Boo! Thank you for falling in love with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Hrrrrrnnngghhh! L-love?! Who gives a damn about love?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You're not acting like yourself at all, little bro.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Oh? You think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You made all these crazy decisions without even pausing to rationalize them, for one! And the people you've roped into your scheme aren't happy! Just stop this already, will you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>It doesn't look like my Ragi-Boo minds a bit, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Your Ragi-Boo has nothing to do with this! This is a matter between us! Us, you got that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Can't handle a little competition?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>What're you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Now love! Now love! Now love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>They're starting to sound like some kind of bird!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>It's just like that ghostly girl said. Thanks to our meddling, Mira, Hiiragi's corrupt regrets have become muddled with otherworldly powers and desires, and have been made manifest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Ragi-Boo got her fighting prowess from Almace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>But she got her recklessness from you, Mira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>N-no way...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>If it's to make my dreams of love come true, I'll do whatever I can for you! Confess my love, right here, right now! I really don't care who to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Wanna fall in love right now! Just like a normal girl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>M-Mira... She sounds just like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>All right, my Ragi-Boos! Let's clear out these interlopers, and form our paradise: Hiiragi Harem!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Now love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Yomi! Wake up! Please! My clones are attacking us! There are so many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Nngh... Being summoned multiple times, between multiple worlds, is just too much for me. I already told you I can't, and I meant it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Almace...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I think this'll do. We've cleaned up after Mira enough for one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Ungh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>There is still much to be done, and I am here to do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I wanna fall in love, just normal love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Nothing about this is normal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>H-huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>At least, not from my perspective. How about yours, Hiiragi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>N-no... Not normal at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I'm not going to let you interfere with my normal life. I will see normality restored...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>You tactless brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>She's right, Nyx. You heard her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Do you know how I feel, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>No, but I've gotten a taste of my own recklessness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I've just been letting you do all the thinking...but it's about time I started doing some, myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Didn't you just have a go at me for failing to rationalize things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Have you forgotten? I'm your older sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Not to mention, we're twins. Of course I understand you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>So...you actually thought about my feelings for once, huh, big sis? About time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>It is. That's why I'm going to right your promiscuous wrongs with sisterly love!</td>
</tr>
