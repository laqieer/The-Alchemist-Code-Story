<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Huff...huff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm...so...done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So, Miss Tina... What do you want to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I...still can't think. You went all out...didn't you, Lisbeth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Of course! I had to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Thank you...Lisbeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I...want to go with Mocca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>See? You tend to overthink things, Miss Tina. Well, I guess that is one of your good qualities, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But sometimes you should just do as you feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm somewhat responsible for Mocca's curse. Isn't it natural that I should accompany her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Then why don't you say so? Why do you need to suppress your feelings?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I love Saga...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So a part of me just doesn't want to leave. Not to mention...I'm scared of what may be out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But...above all else, I have my responsibilities. The Chief of the tribe should be there to help reconstruction efforts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What right do I have to run off just because I want to? That wouldn't help anybody in Saga. I know that much, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Miss Tina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>There is still the threat of the Jam to consider. I have the responsibility of defending the Toxotes tribe against them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Father entrusted the Toxotes to me, so... I have to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But what you want is to go with Miss Mocca, right? Isn't that why you're so conflicted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't you want to go with her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Don't worry! I'll be here in Saga. Well, maybe not forever, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh no! We're surrounded!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Darn... I was too exhausted to notice! There are so many! This might be a problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, there's only one thing we can do... Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Miss Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Glurrrp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>H-huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You don't mean to die here, do you? Get up, before you get in my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Tehre! What are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Voda?! And Fuu?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Looks like we made it just in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Tamis sensed the increase in the number of the Jam. We rushed here after dropping off our Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We're here to fight with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We can be away from our Matter for a short while. All we need is that short while to take care of this situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hmph, you can't even handle this situation, yet you claim you're the one who will defend Saga? Don't make me laugh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Why don't you just go wherever it is you want to go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Were you eavesdropping on us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Heheh. Forgive his rough words. He can't help the way he speaks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>He was the first one to notice that you weren't well, Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You two are more alike than either of you are willing to admit. Maybe he understands how you feel better than any of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That's enough talk. We have the Jam to get rid of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Tehre does have a point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Tina, there is no way you alone can shoulder the fate of all Saga. You should do as you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>There are so many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Do not fret, Lisbeth. Now, Tina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We are the Sprite Trio of Saga. You haven't forgotten the extent of our powers, have you?</td>
