<td>Agh...ahh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Now for the final blow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Take that! Kagutsuchi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Miracle Kanon Slash!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Uck...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>How's that, Zangetsu? This is our power...the power of the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ugff... It appears that I've lost this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>However, my domination will not end here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No. He's gonna make a run for it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Young knight, we'll see how long you can maintain your distorted version of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'll maintain it forever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heheh... What an interesting girl you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wait? Did he just...laugh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Phew... Well, we managed to survive somehow, even though Zangetsu escaped. We were also able to rescue Chihaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I guess you can say we accomplished the minimum of our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Come on; it was a big success! We were able to save both of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>She's right! You're allowed to compliment yourself sometimes, Kudanâ™ª</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Heh. You might be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Thank you so much, Paladins...and you, Princess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You don't have to call me that. My country no longer exists anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I did what anyone would do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I did for you what I would do for anyone who loves Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Heheh. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Please value your comrades. When you are in danger of being consumed by darkness, it is them who will save you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'll remember that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And you, Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Y-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You truly surprised me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>However, remember this. Vast darkness often accompanies the brightest light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Understood! I'll remember that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Heheh. Please do, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well then, let's get out of here. Kagura, Kanon, don't let your guard down until we've completed our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Thank you, Paladins. We will be fine from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What do you plan to do now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Of course, rebuild our homeland. I'll return to Wadatsumi and assist in its reconstruction efforts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'll go with her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I see. I must inquire; isn't there a possibility of history repeating itself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I am aware of that possibility. However, I desperately want to return Wadatsumi to the beautiful country it used to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I understand how you feel. I have a proposal. How about you rely on us for support?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Shrine Maiden Chihaya, there's no doubt that what you're doing is the right thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The fact is that there are those who will not take kindly to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That's why I want to station a few knights from the Holy Guard by your side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>As the Holy Guard represents a presence of peace and justice, no opposition would be likely to lay hands on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I see...so you're offering to assist in the restoration. In other words, your proposal in the same as Zangetsu's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It's different!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Of course there are similarities, but we Paladins want to protect the peace for everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We won't disturb the peace as he did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I was joking. Heheh. For Wadatsumi's sake, I would gladly accept your support.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Well then, let's go home, Mizuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Got it! See you all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yeah, see you! Don't cause problems for Chihaya, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Eheheh. We'll see about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Kanon... I'm truly grateful for everything you've done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Y-you're welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You truly might become the light that swallows the darkness. Please continue to uphold that heart of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Of course! Leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Off they go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Now we've truly completed our mission. Good job, both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Come on, let's go home too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hold up a second!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Kagura, Captain Kudan, how about we make a vow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>A vow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Yes! Just like Chihaya said earlier...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It'll be a vow to uphold our hearts of justice forever as we advanced towards our goals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>All right, Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I am Kagura, Paladin of the Holy Guard! I vow to use this flame to defend all people from tragedy! And, to one day...restore the smiles to those of Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I am Kudanstein, Captain of the Holy Guard! I will fulfill my own destiny and destroy all who threaten this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Indeed, destroy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Alrighty, I'm last!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I am Kanon, Paladin of the Holy Guard! I will become the light that illuminates this world, and someday...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Grrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>H-huhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Come on! You messed everything up, airhead! Heheheh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Shrine Maiden Chihaya has returned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>We've been expecting you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>This is quite some welcome, Chihaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Yes, it is. We can, once again, continue our reconstruction efforts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Now that the Holy Guard is gonna join us, I'm sure it'll go well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>We'll use our own hands to make it a success.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>By the way, Chihaya, about our plans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Mizuchi...what's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Mizu...chi? Mizuchi! Answer me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>So you are the Shrine Maiden Chihaya, savior of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I have no personal grudge against you, but I will take your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Not here...not yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Shrine Maiden Chihaya! Is something wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>She's been stabbed! Summon a healer! Hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>What's the matter, Kanon? Don't stop so abruptly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Sorry, Captain... I just had the chills for a second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Huh?! Right after we sworn an oath?! That's horrible luck! Did you catch a cold or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>N-no, I'm fine. I'm just a little tired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Don't hold back from reporting to me if it worsens. Keep your guard up until we return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Ye-yes, Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>After a moment of uneasiness, Kanon and the others continue on their way back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>They still remain unaware of the true enemy that they must defeat.</td>
</tr>
