<td>She's late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>There is no way shopping for some plates could take so long. Something must have happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Sure, she's taking a while, but she's also a Knight of Wratharis. I doubt we need to worry about her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Dang it, Moa. I take my eyes off of her for one moment, and she's gone! If she gets herself in trouble again, I'm just not going to care!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You say that, but you seem very worried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Sorry, sorry. Well, I've invited plenty of people, so I think I can now help out with... Uh, hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Where's Plumeria?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's what I'd like to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Uh... What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What's wrong, Ankh? You seem irritated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You two missed a lot while you were out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hello, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Welcome back, Plumeria! Wait, what's up with all those flowers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hehe, aren't they beautiful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I picked them from a field. I believe this should be enough to liven up the venue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You were out picking flowers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I was!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This is meant to be a happy party, so I wanted to add some more flair to our hospitality to bring happy smiles to our guests!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see. So this is what kept you for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Perhaps I was not clear enough with my directions, but I absolutely did not ask you for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ankh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Why can you not just do as I say? That's all you needed to do in order for the preparations for this party to progress smoothly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm...sorry. I just wanted this party to be—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Did you even stop to think how your self-indulgent decisions would inconvenience everyone here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hey, uh, Ankh? Let's calm down a little. Come on, you want me to pour you some tea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ah, about that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Unfortunately, Miss Plumeria has already scattered all of my tea leaves on the floor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm so sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Do not be. It was a select brand, but there is no use in crying over spilled milk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Regardless, I am beyond the soothing of a simple cup of tea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Not that it matters. Perhaps a brew of the legendary Parfaire, a tea that is said to have the finest fragrance and flavor, would pacify my temper, but we certainly don't have that here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>A brew of the what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The legendary Parfaire tea... Supposedly the aroma of it is reminiscent of Bergamot tea without relying on artificial fragrances. Though I've only heard of it in passing rumor...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Come on, Ankh. You can't expect anyone to be able to get that for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Clearly I was not being serious. According to the rumors, it is produced somewhere in Wratharis, but even I couldn't find it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Regardless, we do still need to find some tea. It would be a shame if we cannot serve tea at this party.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Parfaire...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>A legendary tea, eh? I heard of it once while on a mission in Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Supposedly it's prepared for some festival in a small village somewhere, and they won't part with it no matter how much you offer to pay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I understand. I will go get that tea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Plumeria? What are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>With that legendary tea, Ankh and all those who attend the party will smile, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>So I will—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You can't simply go to the market and buy yourself some Parfaire. That's why it's considered to be legend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It's somewhere in Wratharis. That's all that is known. And you think you can just go out and get it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>D-did I offend you? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Cease promising to do things you can't do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Can't you see how your thoughtless behavior is causing more trouble for all those around you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ankh! Chill out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Oh, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I-I'm s-sorry... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Ankh, come on...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You need not say more. I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I am not sure why she affects me so. Why can she not just do as I say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>If she would simply follow my directions, things would progress far more efficiently. And yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's probably because she has her own image of what hospitality means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Her own image?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You have your own idea of what hospitality means, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Well, she's got her own ideas about hospitality or White Day or whatever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Those who are most earnest about their ideals can't help but persist with their will, no matter how irrational that may be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Such a straightforward approach to life and ideals can change a person. Even someone like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Trust me, I know someone just like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Yeah, you're both just stubborn people who stick to their guns no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>For now, let's go find our little Plumeria. We should make sure she's okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Fine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You'll pay for what you just said to us! You think it's funny to taunt us for being so miserably unpopular?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Oh, geez. I'd feel sorry for myself if I said a line like that. Are you guys trying to start a fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>D-dammit! We're gonna wreck this stupid party!</td>
