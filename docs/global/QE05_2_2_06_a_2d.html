<td>002</td>
<td>Yes, sir! We are currently engaged in battle with the rebel army! General Leordas is leading the charge! Neither side is gaining ground!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Crush them! What is holding you back?! We should be able to overwhelm them with our sheer numbers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>W-we're trying, but the rebels have the Holy Guard and those village warriors on their side, and they have the advantage of their magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Tch... Then split our force and have them attack from both flanks! We'll make use of every soldier we have on the field!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sir, b-but that'll leave our stronghold unprotected!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Did I stutter? Fool! I still cannot control this power with precision! If my own troops are in my way, I cannot swallow them whole!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The soldiers at the front have all disappeared?! Has this information been verified?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes, sir. I was told that the ground opened up and swallowed all the soldiers still standing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Is this some new trump card of theirs? I cannot imagine how they could have gained that kind of power, though. How...? What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Never mind, that is not important! We must bolster the vanguard! Have we finished evacuating the villagers yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes. They are all on their way to the southern border now. They should reach the desert by dawn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Then call our soldiers back and we will reform our ranks! Have Lord Waginau and the others not returned yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Not yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I see. Then we must do what we must. First, we will avenge our fallen friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Spread the word! We will fall back to the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The Liberation Army is retreating?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Have they sustained that much damage already? I should join up with them quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Here! Found a single enemy unit wandering on his own over here! Let's get him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It seems like that's going to have to wait until I've dealt with this, though...</td>
