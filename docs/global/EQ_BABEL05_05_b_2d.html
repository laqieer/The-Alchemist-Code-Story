<td>You'd take it, right?</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You'd throw in every last coin you have on you.</td>

<td>That's how I feel right now.</td>

<td>Wha—?! You...! How do you have that stone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It came from the ruins of an ancient civilization in Slothstein.</td>

<td>I stole it from an old friend of mine.</td>

<td>No! The stone...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Looks like my calculations were correct. I thought that I could make it shatter if I imbued it with just the right level of Alchemia from this angle.</td>

<td>Why you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Now Slothstein's stone is out of play.</td>

<td>Deal with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Surround him! We must kill him at all costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We cannot afford to let him live.</td>

<tr>

<td>Come on, then. Try me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
