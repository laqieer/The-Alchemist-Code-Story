<td>What is going on? It's highly unusual for any beasts to begin attacking people at this time of the night.</td>

<td>In addition, that frenzied appearance... Something is not right with the great Sephiron... Come to think of it, what are you even doing here, Hisham?</td>

<td>K-Kamui, I'm sorry, but...I heard a voice.</td>

<td>A voice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah, exactly! I am sure I heard a voice calling me, coming from Sephiron. A familiar voice... Nngh... My head...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hisham! We can speak later. You should head home and rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>B-but... I'm sure that voice... My mother...!</td>

<td>Is this...your memories coming back?</td>

<td>I'm not sure, but... Please, Kamui! I have to know! I have to follow that voice!</td>

<td>Fine, but I'm coming with you. Those beasts should keep their distance if I do.</td>

<td>Where is the voice coming from?</td>

<td>Over there.</td>

<td>The arboreal altar lies in that direction. Could Sephiron be responding to Hisham's Alchemia...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No, this isn't the time to be contemplating such matters. Hisham, be sure to stay with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>O-okay...</td>
