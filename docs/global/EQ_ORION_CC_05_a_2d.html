<td>(Ngh... She was never this fast when we fought before... I suppose this is why they call her the Thunder Wolf...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So this is your true power. Not bad for someone being eaten alive by Greed incarnate. There's not even the slightest hint of faltering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are you mocking me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I would never. Just thinking that all of this was...pretty inevitable, in the end.</td>

<td>006</td>
<td>Please forgive me. This was the only choice I had.</td>

<td>I'm sorry, Lord Orion. I was simply following my orders.</td>

<td>No one can escape from Mammon. Even the most trustworthy person...even you...even I will give in to Greed eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Trustworthy? No one is ever trustworthy. Putting your faith in others is a fool's errand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You may be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, you've had your fun. Now it's time to go, Orion. Like it or not, on either of our parts, Mammon is inside me now. Not you.</td>
</tr>

<td>You can try to push me away all you want, but the great Thunder Wolf Langhao isn't one to suffer in silence. You're a fighter. And I will relieve you of Mammon's eternal torment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hmph. You can certainly try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Consuming others—consuming destiny itself—through any means possible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And surviving, against all odds... That's Thunder Wolf Langhao. That's the woman I've come to know. The person I've come to trust.</td>

<td>Ahahaha! You roar well today! But let's see how much of it is real, and how much is just for show!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>How fun! If only we could do this forever, and forget everything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If only. But this will end it. I won't allow you to claim Mammon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmph. Have it your way, then. Take this, lion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Bring it on, wolf!</td>
