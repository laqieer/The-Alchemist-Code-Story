<td>On your first campaign, you managed to defeat Vlad, one of the Deadly Trio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You truly are sons of House Crowley. Outstanding. There's no other way to put it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We're unworthy of such praise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You do us a great honor!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hehe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Your Majesty, they still have much to learn. Such flattering praise will not serve them well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Come now. I'm sure this news will bring great joy to the kingdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Their almost reckless bravery reminds me of when you were young.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This further proves they have brilliantly inherited what you, hero of the Wratharis War, have taught them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...You are too kind, Your Majesty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well then, Zeke, what is your take on the report that the Wratharis rebels have begun to use Alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I believe it is possible. After all, Wratharis was annihilated because they revived Alchemy,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>even after it was forbidden in the Magna Code set by the Alliance of the Seven Kingdoms of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Their Alchemy was thought to have been eradicated along with the destruction of Wratharis, but they may have secretly passed it on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hearing this, Logi and Dias exchange nervous glances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>In the continent, only the Holy Guard are permitted to wield Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Gabirond, as that is your area of expertise, how do you see this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It is true that signs of Alchemy still remain within Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If their report is accurate, I say we should pluck the buds as soon as we can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So, they are training those to wield the forbidden art and eyeing a rebellion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Most likely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Along with Logi and Dias, I will search every corner of Old Wratharis. If we discover any rebels, we will annihilate them immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If there are any traces of Alchemy, according to the Magna Code, the Holy Guard should be summoned to suppress them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Very well. Zeke, take your children along with the Blue Flame Guard and discover the movements of the rebels!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes, Your Majesty!</td>
