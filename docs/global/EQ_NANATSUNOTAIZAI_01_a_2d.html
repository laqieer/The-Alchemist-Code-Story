<td>What is this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What...? The Albions have awakened...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>They must be drawn to this power that I'm sensing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Where is its source?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I've never seen anything like this world before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If I could make this power my own...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It might be what I need to finally eradicate those bothersome Seven Deadly Sins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>To finally carry out my revenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>To make him regret his betrayal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'll be coming for you, Meliodas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Elizabeth! Wake up, Elizabeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Mm, just five more minutes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Come on, sleepyhead, this is no time for that! Up! Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>O-okay! Wait, Hawk...? Where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't know. We were here when I woke up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Be careful. We can't be sure what to expect. Stay close to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hawk! Behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Buh! Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wh-who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>My name is Ouroboros, the Observer of Destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The observer of...destiny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The natural order of this world has been disrupted. To rectify this problem, I have brought you here, to the Door of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You're the one that brought us here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I did. An uninvited guest has come into this world, here to try his fortune on the continent of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Babel...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>A world apart from your own. That is all you need to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That one's desire for power was so strong, the boundaries between our worlds were diluted by it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I find myself...uncertain about his character. Virtuous...or wicked? Behold...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Waaaaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hm... It seems that it will take some time to make this world's power my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Still, my original powers are effective even in this world. Then... I suppose...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I will start by pillaging what I can from this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Are those...Albions?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What is happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It is a scene I cut out from this world for you to see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You mean Albions are running wild in that world we just saw?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That is correct. There is not much in this world that can repel those giants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That is why I summoned you. I understand you have some means of dealing with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Just the two of us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I have brought others, but the instability of the boundaries between our worlds has caused some complications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Find the others summoned here. Band together with them and defeat those giants. Eliminate the one who caused this disruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Those are the tasks I now lay before you. You must restore the natural order of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Wait, why do we have to?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Time and space is distorted by the presence of those from other worlds here. This cannot be remedied while the otherworlder remains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Eliminating them will return this world to what it should be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That will allow you two to return to your world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>That's just not right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wait, Hawk! Think about it. The Albions and the person that caused the disruption...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>They're causing the people here to suffer, isn't that correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I understand. We'll do what we can to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>E-Elizabeth?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>If there are people in trouble, then we have to help! Our world is infringing upon theirs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>But still—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I guarantee a safe return after your mission is accomplished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Fear not, otherworlders. I will prepare a guide for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>So this is Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>This really is a different world... Everything seems so odd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Aw, come on! We just got here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hawk! Stay back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Elizabeth! Wait up!</td>
</tr>
