<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>How did they find us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It is you! Thought ya pulled the wool over my eyes, did ya?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You're that old man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I took pity on you and gave ya some of my hard-earned money, an' here you been one of then accursed demon spawn this whole time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's just as I said: demons right under our noses! It's because of these two that we've been living in fear for so very, very long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Had we not rallied for reconciliation all those years ago, we'd surely be living in peace now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You know what must be done with these ill-omened twins, do you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The queen certainly isn't going to protect us. We have to look out for our own best interests! We have to take matters into our own hands! So, what do we do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But, why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I don't know, but we can't hurt these people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What'd you just say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You know the tale of Koga and Kaede, the malefactors who forged that false peace between man and demon? Their children are even now secretly living in the nearby caves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You mean, the demon spawn who were raised in the castle? That rumor was true?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Indeed. And do you not find it telling? Why would the queen need to have harbored demon children in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Unless those in charge have been in league with demons from the very beginning... Does that not seem a reasonable conclusion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But why would they do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>To groom Wadatsumi into a country of demons, of course! A deal the queen negotiated over many moons, no doubt—most likely in exchange for her own safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ohh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>At this rate, if we don't act, we'll all be killed. Has anyone seen any suspicious figures around town of late?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh! Now that ya mention it... But, nahh, he just seemed like a perfectly ordinary kid. Ain't nothin' suspicious about him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's exactly how the demons deceive us! Then, when our backs are turned, they strike us down. We must strike them first, before it is too late!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Strike them first?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Must I spell it out for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ya know, you're a bit of a suspicious figure yourself. Ya ain't pullin' our chains, are ya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I swear to you, it's all true. One of the twins has horns sprouting from its head. See for yourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>All those who can fight, come with me. And bring weapons! This is a life or death struggle. We must not go in unprepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Heheh. How was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Masterful. You're completely indistinguishable from a human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh, this is nothing. Now it's simply a matter of disposing of those twins, as we've planned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Indeed. Wadatsumi has no need of abominations with the blood of both human and demon flowing through their veins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>This land will never see a union betwixt the two again. Then my research can continue with far more...predictable data sets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I couldn't care less either way. All I'm interested in is increasing our numbers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...so that one day, Wadatsumi can finally belong to the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hmph. Trying to get away without bloodshed? I'll draw you into a fight yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hurry and kill them! If they get away, it won't be just your lives in danger, but your families' as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ergh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>My family ain't been around for a long time now, so I ain't got nothin' to lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I... I never intended to deceive you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Shut yer trap! If it weren't for you demons, they'd still be here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Why'd they have to die, huh?! Tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ain't no good ever gonna come from associatin' with demons! Guh... Grah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Grr... Grrahck! Grrahck! Gwwwaaaaarrrrrggghhhhh!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What's happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>But I'm betting this has all been orchestrated by our puppetmaster!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It's so awful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Mikaboshi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'm okay. I vowed to myself that I wouldn't ever look away again. This eye will behold everything...no matter how sad it may be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(Come on, Mother. Show me something that'll help! Anything!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...! Sumeragi, with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>So that's it! Hyaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>A demon that can camouflage itself? Nice work spotting it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Gah! You may have seen through my disguise...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But you can't stop me that easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The cursed twins are over this way! Be careful: they have demons under their command!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Oh no! The ones who got here first are being torn apart! It's kill or be killed! Aaaaagh! Geheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>No, it's not like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Eeek! I-I don't wanna die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>We'll talk later! For now, we need to destroy these demons and secure the citizens' safety!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Is anyone hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>The queen has come to save us? But... No, that can't be! I just saw her conspiring with the demon children. The royal family really is in league with them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What is the meaning of this? Aren't you supposed to protect us? Why are you allied with demons?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>That's not—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Don't. Whatever you say, they'll just twist your words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>But, I can't just sit back and watch Lady Mitsuha—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Don't worry, I have an idea. When I give the signal, follow my lead, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>What kind of queen are you? What kind of country do you think you're running?! If no one's going to protect us...then you leave us little choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>We'll do what has to be done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Nobody move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>One more step from any of you lot and the queen gets it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>(Ahh, I see! Interesting plan...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You think she's in league with us? Preposterous! Let me clear up that little misunderstanding right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Being raised in Castle Aquila Rubrum was simply a means to an end—a chance for us to gain the opportunity to kill Queen Mitsuha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Mikaboshi? Sumeragi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>As if we'd ever ally ourselves with humans! Kill the queen and the nation crumbles. And then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Wadatsumi will belong to the demons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>You get it now? Once we've killed the queen, we can kill all of you whenever we want. That's what demons do, after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I think that's enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>And we made the queen raise us under threat, too, I'll have you know! In what world would humans and demons join sides? Pfah, I say!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>You think we'd ever bother killing you nobodies? That wouldn't get us any closer to making this a country for demons! It's much faster to kill your leader, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>So, wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>There is no connection between the queen and us. Humans and demons are natural-born enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>That's right! Nothing more, nothing less. Just fodder to be killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Uhh. If this is true, we're in a pretty tough spot, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>If the queen were to get killed, we—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Clear the way! If you do, we'll release your queen and pretend none of this ever happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>If you let us pass, you'll have saved her life, and your own lives by extension. I think you'll find this to be a very reasonable demand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Hey! I told you, not another step forward! Stay back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I've never seen a lousier performance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>All this nonsense about me consorting with demons... What rot! I swear, I've given everything to defend the people of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>But it's equally wrong to say that I have no connection with these two. I've sworn to protect every last citizen of Wadatsumi, and these twins are no exception to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Though we are not bound by blood...they are, nonetheless, my beloved children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha! Don't! You're going to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>So all them rumors about the queen and the cursed twins were true! She even says they're her children, of all things!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>No! You're mistaken! She's only saying this because we forced her to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I said that's enough. I'm the one who chose to bear this responsibility. I'll handle the reproach as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I'd never lie to save my own neck. I'd rather die than live like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>So I'll scream this from the rooftops if I have to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Please, don't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>These two are the twins that Koga and Kaede left behind, Mikaboshi and Sumeragi. And they are—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>...They are my children. And I don't care what anyone has to say about that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>You don't need to say anything, either. This is my burden to bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>So the queen really has been in league with demons all along! We can't let this stand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>It's a demon! No! Stay back! I don't want to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>I sure am a sorry excuse for a queen, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Leaving the people in such a state, while I hide out in my castle...and you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>You really did pick a lousy time to make a stand, Lady Mitsuha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Here we were trying to protect you, and then you go and turn that around on us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>So let us handle this one. It's our turn now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Ngh!<br>What...are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Thank you, Lady Mitsuha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>And...goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>We're so grateful to have been raised by you. You made us so happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>That's right. But now it's time for you to be happy. And that's why we have to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>But before we do, I think we both have one last request to make of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>One final, selfish request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Just this once, for the first and last time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>...let us call you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>...Mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Let's go. We'll lure the demons as far from here as possible, so that Lady Mitsuha will be safe when she wakes up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Right. This way, everyone! The twins you detest so much are right here before your eyes! If you want to kill us, you'd better come catch us!</td>
</tr>
