<td>Although the Compass never faltered, the voyage towards the Twilight Zone was by no means an uneventful one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>One time we were tormented by the perfect calm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What?! Th-there's no wind whatsoever...the ship won't move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well...I can use my magic...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Time to display my powers as a witch! Forwaaaard!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>W-wow! It's moving forward! Lisbeth, do your best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That was about...10 centimeters...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Laevateinn, let's at least give her points for effort...and enthusiasm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>One time it was a giant iceberg blocking our path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>At this rate, we'll hit it... Go around it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We don't have time to be making detours. That's just a piece of ice, right? We should just cut it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...You cut the iceberg in half!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Amazing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Another time an underwater volcano erupted and we sailed in scorching water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh, it's so hot...I can't take it anymore. I don't think I can wear clothes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>True...huh, hey, you gotta endure! Don't take off your clothes, Amaterasu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But in the Twilight Zone I never have to worry about that kind of stuff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>In this way we made our way through the tumultuous ocean, continuing onward on our adventure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>In order to retrieve the Sun Keys stolen by the thief,</td>

<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td><p_name> and the others follow the Golden Compass and continue to sail the sea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Meanwhile...the boat is covered by a thick fog that makes it impossible to see anything ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Sigh... Not only can we not see anything but the waves are rough. If we get careless we could fall off the boat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>if we follow the Compass, we shouldn't need to be able to see anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ugggh...sorry...I feel...sea sick...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well, it's shaking pretty hard...but now might not be the best time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Uggrraaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>When I think about how we're going to have to go up against the Fallen, now isn't the time to be struggling with something like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td><p_name>! This way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>O...okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>As they fight, the girls protect <p_name>, who lacks fighting skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hey, Amaterasu. Could the Fallen be manipulating these monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I feel like they're different than the ordinary monsters I've encountered before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>There's a high possibility of that. Taking advantage of the monsters' anxiety from the lack of sunlight...she must be manipulating their dark emotions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>In order to eliminate the sunlight from all the worlds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>She may be using the monsters to directly harm...no, to kill, any who oppose her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Sigh...Honestly, we've taken on quite the troublesome opponent. I'm getting sick of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm getting a little...tired as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh? What's happening to the two of you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>With the sunlight diminishing...it might already be affecting their minds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>After all, the energy that the sun gives to the world is enormous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's enough to say that, if it were to disappear, the world may very well be destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We have to make sure that doesn't happen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Heheh...I won't let you get in the way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>While they were momentarily distracted by the voice that pierces the fog, Lisbeth's cheek is grazed by an enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>In order to identify the enemy who harmed her, Lisbeth turns and gazes into the fog towards where the attack came from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>N-no...! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Appearing before Lisbeth is none other than...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Khhoooh...khhohhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It is none other than the ultimate vermin, the King of Ants, Kaiser.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huh, why are you here, Mr. Ant?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>No way...the one who stole the Sun Keys is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That's right...Liz...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Huh, oh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Our curse will never be lifted...we must think of a new way of living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I-I promise that I will find...a way to remove your curse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Why do only we men have to suffer from this curse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Why do we have to be oppressed by the humans that we love?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>St-stop...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Humans, insects, the flowers...we all equally suffer...from the disappearance of the sun...don't you think it would be fair?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>If all is cursed...if all is trapped in darkness...don't you think that...gender inequalities would disappear as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...N-no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Liz...the insects you helped take flight and healed were ultimately killed by the witches...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Living as an insect...bares nothing but misfortune.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Whether we die prematurely as an insect...or are killed as maggots by humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>B-but...there must be a way...to remove the curse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Liz...do you truly believe that Asmodeus's curse can be lifted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Insects returning to human form? You must be dreaming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Do you think it is something that will happen before my short lifespan runs out...or before I am killed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Liz...tell me...how is it going to be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Huff...huff...! Huh? Wh...where am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Lisbeth wakes up to find herself surrounded by everyone looking at her with worried expressions on their faces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Are you okay? You were moaning loudly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>A dream? Was that all...a dream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Sensing pain, Lisbeth looks down at her arm to see the vivid remains of the wound Kaiser had given her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>This wound...is it real? If so, was what happened...reality? Was I with...that ant?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Maybe it was a trap set by the Fallen who is after the Sun Key that Lisbeth has...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Huh...just now...did...I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>What's the matter, Lisbeth? You seem to be deep in thought. Is there something on your mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Oh, um...n-no...um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I was...dreaming, but...for some reason...I can't remember what it was about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Can't you remember anything? It might lead to some clue that'll help us identify our enemy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I'm sorry. It all just disappeared. I can't remember...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Huh? We gained nothing from that? There's a high possibility this will be a reckless battle. Can we really continue on like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I'm trying my best to remember! But...I can't!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Hey, both of you, please stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Uggrraaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>!!!</td>
