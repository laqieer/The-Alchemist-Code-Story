<td>Eren, fall back! Switch to omni-directional mobility... Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's time for you to eat dirt, monkey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Groaghhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Sorry. We put a heavy burden on those shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Whoa! Okay, then. So... What exactly are you up to right now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm recalibrating the Mecha Weapon. I need to incorporate new data in order to target the Giant Taurus more accurately and effectively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Is that not what I am supposed to be doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>A weapon is not just for fighting. You carry not only your father's legacy, but also the burden of your own justice and the responsibility to protect this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I don't need you to tell me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The Titans are falling back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Don't pursue them! Our goal here is not to take down the Titans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We're here to return them to their own world! If we can do that, then we'll have succeeded!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If we can do that, indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We must concentrate on defeating the Giant Taurus first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tch. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth to just let them go, but...fine. Orders are orders. You got that, Judith?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yeah. Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Judith, you hold the fate of Babel...and also their world in your hands. I believe in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Basheeny...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I have no intention of forgiving you and yours for taking my dad away from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I understand... I wasn't expectating to be forgiven, Judith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I do hope that we can talk about this a little more after we've settled everything here, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes... I have come to see that we have the same goal. Perhaps there was just a...misunderstanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Now that I've met you, I have come to think that might be possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Thank you, Judith. I know that it is not easy, even for me, to allow for the possibility of something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Basheeny... Should I really believe it? World peace...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Is that really something that you believe in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If that's the case, then...I guess I really have no choice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We've gone and done it now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The Giant Taurus and the Titans are all coming at us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Heh, what's that? You scared?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>As if, half-wit. Hope your knees aren't shaking too much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hey. Be serious. It's time for the real fight to start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>We'll draw the attention of the Titans around them. Eren, Mikasa, are you ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'll go with you. Better put everything we've got into this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Watch for Reiner... We've got this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I won't forget you, even after you return to your own world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrroooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Urk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Tehre!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Don't get distracted! You're the only one who can do this! I'm counting on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Take all of the suffering that victims of the Giant Taurus have experienced and use it to hit that monster even harder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That's the last time you hurt anyone else, Giant Taurus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Not only for my father's legacy, but for this world, for everyone... I fight to protect all of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Anti-Giant Taurus Mecha Weapon, maximum energy attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Wh-what? This is...all...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wait... Is it...reacting to my Alchemia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What an incredible response! With this, then it must be possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Uggggrraaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Giant Taurus, this is the end of you! I will overcome you, and everything else that stands in my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The electrifying mechanic extraordinaire, Judith, will wipe you out with a swoosh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You're nothing to me! I will move forward, no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Do you hear me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I said, do you hear me?!</td>
