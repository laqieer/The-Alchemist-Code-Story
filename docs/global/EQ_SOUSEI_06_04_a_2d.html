<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>So that's what happened... I'm so sorry. If only we'd noticed sooner, then we could've aided you in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Don't worry. The reinforcements you sent our way were already plenty of help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's unfortunate that it's become extremely difficult to travel in large numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That man, Quence, possesses Space-Time Manipulation powers that can cover a large area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Leading a large troop of men would be like leading lambs to the slaughter. He'd just have to make the air grow heavy again and it'd be over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>But the shield regimen—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I'll take them under my command. Daphne, you should travel with Nimul and the others. I'll leave their protection to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>With the Silver Shield's divine protection, there is none more capable than you, even alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yeah, but that guy is a huge cheat! Why does he get to use all the magil he wants?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>He said he controls the Cursed Beast, so I assume that must be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Space-Time Manipulation requires you to manipulate the magil in the atmosphere to be effective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So if we were to control that Cursed Beast—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Don't be ridiculous! Sure, in theory that'd be possible, but seriously? Do you think we could actually do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Even Icona struggled with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But somehow that man achieved it. We must not forget that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But we can't deploy the army... This is tricky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The Ira Belt army has surely been told of our approach. They'll be wary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Traveling in small numbers brings its own risks. It'll be over if the enemy manages to surround you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...I may know a good path to take.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's the road I took when I slipped out of the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's a very narrow pass, so we can't move a lot of folk through it at once, but if you want to move stealthily it is easily our best option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Andechs! You shouldn't be up yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm afraid there's no time for me to slumber while the Ira Belt is in danger...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Quence told us himself, didn't he? This place will soon perish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...It's true. Looking at it objectively, the Ira Belt's days may soon be numbered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's why we have to hurry— Ngh—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>A-are you okay? Can you still move?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Heh, I'm your everyday righteous knight! Getting cut to pieces is all in a day's work... Hahaha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's no laughing matter...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But we have no choice but to rely on him for now. None of us know this region like he does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What about that child from before? Sulva, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We took him back with us before he could slip away, but I don't think we can ask him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>He seems so absent-minded and confused. It's as if he can't get his mind in order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Let's wait a little longer so that Andechs can recover instead. We can decide what to do then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We can go now, I'm fi—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No, you're not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ouch, ouch, ouch! You're surprisingly strong for a little lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We depart for the capital tonight. We'll want to move under the cover of darkness as much as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Let's get Libra back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yeah, we're going to have a hard time with the Cursed Beast if we don't retrieve Libra first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Isn't it kinda weird, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What's weird?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We've got other Gears of Judgement, so why did he want Libra out of all of them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Well, the guy also uses Space-Time Manipulation, right? So maybe Libra would the easiest for him to use?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Do you really think that's all there's to it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Here we go! I'm back on my feet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Your wounds haven't closed yet, so don't overdo it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah, I gotcha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>So, about that path?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Right. We'll need to head east from here, until we hit this place where there used to be a large river.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The heat has long evaporated all of the water, but that means there is now a narrow and covert path surrounded by large boulders in its place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It will lead us straight into the capital.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I used the same path when I slipped out of this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Are you sure about this? We won't get caught?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I can't make any promises, but I'd say it beats traveling over land and getting surrounded by the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Got it. Let's use the path you spoke of. Is everybody ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>We will continue to explore the surroundings. If the chance arises, we'll distract the enemy troops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...I know it's not much, but I figure it's still better than nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>No, I appreciate that and I'm sure it will be helpful. Just be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Nicaea is taking care of things back at the border camp. We won't have to worry about attacks from behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That is most reassuring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Let's go then. Everyone, after me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Hey. Sulva, right? I brought you a little midnight snack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Where did that child run off to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>My brother failed to invade the Invidia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>And now the Invidia Belt has come to attack us instead. I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Then this is all going according to that serpent's plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>That man is dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>He's definitely just using you, my queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hm, he likely is. But I fear I have no other options.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>We were simply left with no other hope after my brother fell to the corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Hope...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What is hope anyway? My queen, what do you expect me to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What am I supposed to do here? What am I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Is this the place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Yep. The Nameless Valley. We just have to walk upriver and we'll stealthily slip into the capital in no time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You can tell where the water wore away the riverbed... But it really is all dried up now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>This river dried up just before I had to make my escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Satna's awakening has twisted the earth and warped the flow of nature...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Look at how much this place has been twisted and destroyed. Even if we defeat the Cursed Beast now, how much will be left?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>...Perhaps we're wrong...and it's already too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Save the pessimism for when it's over, Andechs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>The Invidia Belt started to change for the better after the Leviathan was slain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I'm sure the Ira Belt will experience the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Of course, you're right... Sorry, this gloomy place got to me for a moment there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>The path gets a little complicated here, so make sure nobody gets separated—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Tsk. So it's started this already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Over there! Mt. Shinai is erupting again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>We have to hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Hurry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Andechs, what's the sudden rush?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Nimul, wait! The magil in this area just flared up in a very strange way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>That's...the corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Dammit! We're too late!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I remember this—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>This is just like when the Gula Belt was enveloped in Beelzebub's corruption...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>It's started...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>A sign that the night of fire rain is coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>The night of fire...what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>The name of the catastrophe that made me leave the Ira Belt for aid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>The sacred mountain Shinai erupts once every 10 years due to the influence of the slumbering Satna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>It's a minor eruption for now, but it'll grow in ferocity over time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>At full power, its flames are powerful enough to extinguish all signs of human life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>And as for the flames that touch the ground—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>They turned into Fallen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I'll hold off the corruption in this area! Everybody else focus on the enemies in front of us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Here they come!</td>
</tr>
