</tr>
<tr>

<td>Right. We'll need to head east from here, until we hit this place where there used to be a large river.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>The heat has long evaporated all of the water, but that means there is now a narrow and covert path surrounded by large boulders in its place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>It will lead us straight into the capital.</td>
</tr>

<td>I used the same path when I slipped out of this country.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Got it. Let's use the path you spoke of. Is everybody ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>We will continue to explore the surroundings. If the chance arises, we'll distract the enemy troops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>...I know it's not much, but I figure it's still better than nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>

<td>Of course.</td>

<td>Nicaea is taking care of things back at the border camp. We won't have to worry about attacks from behind.</td>
