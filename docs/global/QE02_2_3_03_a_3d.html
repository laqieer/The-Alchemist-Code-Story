<td>Allie, where's the locomotive?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It'll pass here in a minute from now! We made it, aye!</td>

<td>Just barely. There's one thing I want to make sure before the locomotive comes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>As you can see from how they were waiting for us at the station, the Beckrams have been expecting us to attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm sure they've implemented extreme security measures. Moreover, once we're in the train compartments, there's no way of escaping. There's a chance that they've even planted traps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Are you trying to say that it'll be dangerous? Don't worry. I'm prepared. I'm the cause of all of this. There's no escaping for me.</td>

<td>But...</td>

<td>You have to pave your own path...right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?</td>

<td>Aye, don't worry! Whatever happens, Fiona, I'll protect you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You seem determined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Jeez. Don't hold me responsible for whatever happens, all right? That being said, little lady...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You moved me with your determination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I'm sure your father would've been proud to see how much you've grown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Heheh. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Here comes the locomotive, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>All right! Look sharp. We're going in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>A-are we gonna jump down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Come on. There's no way I'm leaving my pal in a place like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Wait...we're gonna go down on the bike?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Of course. Come on. The clock protector is waiting for us! Hold on tight!</td>
