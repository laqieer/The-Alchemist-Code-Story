<td>Dammit... They're stronger than I thought. It's not worth fighting them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You lose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So, we're "not worth fighting" you say? Are you taking orders from someone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hey, are you alright? Could you tell us what's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Actually...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...so what you're saying is that you were in a facility and they were about to do something "scary" so you ran away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Those scientists were scary and I had home to go back to. My parents are gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I was too scared to stay there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So what was it that was scary? What were they going to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I...don't know. But the scientists said something about "experimenting."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Experimenting...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sounds very suspicious. Cheryl, what should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>First of all, we need to keep this child safe. We can't just leave a child like this alone around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>First, let's find the Peacekeepers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wait! My little sister's still there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Your little sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>They're going to do experiments. Not me, but on my sister. I have to help her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So you escaped in order to find help and rescue her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Alright. We promise to rescue her. Let's go, Cheryl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Courage! Wait a minute. There are a lot of things to consider.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>An inquisitor's job is to find those who violate the Magna Code... At the moment we don't have enough evidence for an inquisitor to investigate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But if we don't move now it might be too late. Let's at least go and have a look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's against the rules for an inquisitor to act arbitrarily. We would need permission from a superior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I have a strong will as an inquisitor and it's important for me to follow protocol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Strong authority may lead to violence... But if we follow the rules, all will be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Cheryl, I honestly understand what you're saying. But if we hesitate, something worse could happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You can't let that happen, can you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Courage. How are you not afraid? You have a gun that is powerful enough to kill...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Powerful enough to take a life away in an instant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Of course I'm afraid. But I have to be cautious when I aim it accordingly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I would never point my gun in the wrong direction. It's always aimed at the correct target.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The correct target...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hey, Cheryl. I know how important it is to follow the rules...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But don't you think it's the right thing to do when you see this frightenened little child with your own eyes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hey, Cheryl. What you say makes sense, and of course it's important to follow the rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But if we follow every rule and regulation, we're bound to miss important details along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Cheryl. Do not forget where we place our stance on rule violations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(I must find the violators...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But... you are an inquisitor, and not like me who has free will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm going to go alone, so please look after the child, Cheryl. Time to go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(Laws must be followed. If one breaks the rules, one shall be punished...just like them.)<br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(But...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Are you done with your paperwork, Cheryl? I'm done with mine, so it's time for a break.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Um, no. No yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Why? You're being a bit too strict on yourself. Aren't you taking too much time doing that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That's not the case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Excuse me. Before you go on break, could you watch this child? There are a few more things I need to finish up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What is with the number of guards? There are way too many to be guarding an orphanage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ugh... This is not good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Courage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Cheryl? What the...? Isn't this against protocol for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That may be true, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I can't just watch a little child cry and not do anything about it when I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>My duty as an inquisitor is priority, but I have to use my power for what I believe is right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Cheryl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>An inquisitor? What's the meaning of this? What is an inquisitor doing here...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Why are you panicking? Unless, there's something that you're hiding perhaps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'm not sure what's going on, actually. I just said, "I want you to meet that child's sister." And then all this ruckus occurs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>So, this would be classified as self defense, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Understoof. I accept your request for a legitimate inquisition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>D-dammit...! Do not let them inside! Do as I say!</td>
</tr>
