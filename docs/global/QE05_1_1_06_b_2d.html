<td>This should hold for a while. Unfortunately, to completely seal the Sacred Stone's curse, we must conduct the rituals at my village.</td>

<td>The South, where the village of the Sephira is located, is in direct conflict with us, the North.</td>

<td>If I were to take the Stone to the South, the generals protecting the royal capital will feel slighted by my actions.</td>

<td>Do you believe this may lead to deepening the animosity between the regions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I do. My authority alone can no longer contain the turmoil.</td>

<td>I plan to seek assistance from Saga.</td>

<td>That may help mitigate the effects of the preemptive curse on this land.</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>In the meantime, I will end this civil war at all costs, and clear the path to Sephiron.</td>

<td>Would you tell that to Iakov, the leader of your people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yes, Your Highness.</td>

<td>I should return to the village as soon as possible to report on this matter, but what will I do about Hisham?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Can I help you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh, I apologize. It was just that I do not recognize you. I am Ceclidis, General of the Third Legion.</td>
