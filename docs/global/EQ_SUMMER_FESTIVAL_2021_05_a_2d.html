<td>This is my second time in the mountains with you guys, since you came after me before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh, yeah? I, uh, guess that's the case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Sol's not very discriminate about jobs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I thought he was kind of a pain at the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>To be honest, that was my reaction, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I thought it was annoying to deal with a knight who clung so strongly to demands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I guess we're the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...But a knight is no longer needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You said it earlier. FÃ¼ry is so strong she doesn't need a knight anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I don't know whether knights are necessary or not, but I think I remember her saying something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That one knight would be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>One knight is fine. One knight is what I want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Button said that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I see... She's silly like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I may not be your favorite knight...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(I wanted you to live, so I made you dirty your hands and forced a life you didn't want upon you.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(Of course, it was necessary. But I made it your only choice. I wanted more for you.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(I felt guilty for the guile with which I acted. That's why I couldn't look after you properly.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(But even then... You still called this knave a knight.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Gah! Why?! These ritual things should be making me stronger. Why isn't it working?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If I could get this right, then we'd have an army of immortals to help us take power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That is a dream destined never to come true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Too bad, so sad. That ritual doesn't work on immortal soldiers. It doesn't matter if you have extra tools or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Just set down the stuff and back away, and we can put this all behind us. Or it seems you prefer the hard way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You guys are really a pain, aren't ya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I really don't care what you guys were planning on doing. So... Sorry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I must protect that which my king left to me. Because I am her knight!</td>
