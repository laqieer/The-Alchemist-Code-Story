<td>According to the reports, this is one of the spots where they've been conducting those horrific Alchemical experiments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Aha! Here we are. Records.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Extraction of Alchemia from living beings... Observation of test subjects after strenuous exertion... Effects of experimentation on human anatomy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's all so grim!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>How can such atrocities take place here in this country, unexposed by the Inquisition? I must dispose of this all immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Behind the public efforts to put an end to the war, illegal Alchemy experiments are being conducted by an underground organization, planting fresh seeds of new conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Of course, the researchers covered their tracks as best as they could in the time they had, to avoid any questioning from the Inquisition. But inevitably, some traces remain.</td>

<td>Their work likely no longer serves any nation in any positive way, yet it's the patronage of those in charge that brought about these ill-begotten seeds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And like my mother and sister did that day, countless innocent civilians are sure to suffer as a result. I cannot turn a blind eye to this.</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So I will bring ruin to it all. It's the only just thing to do.</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Tch. Got me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You. I've sensed your presence following me for some time now. What is it you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's no concern of yours. It's not you I'm after.</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hold it!</td>

<td>Rrg...</td>

<td>Master?</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ah! Erm, it's nothing. Don't worry. I must have simply been lost in my thoughts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You're tired, is more like it. Perhaps we should rest for a while?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No, I'm fine. Let's continue. Training with you always lifts my spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If you're sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I am. Now, come at me with everything you've got!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Right! Here we go!</td>
