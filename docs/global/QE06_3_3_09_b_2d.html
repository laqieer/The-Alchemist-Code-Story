</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You intend to go alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's a good opportunity for me to acquaint myself with this new body. Besides which, I think it best to sever all external bonds to its previous occupant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I won't hold back this time. I will deliver certain death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is the place, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Beyond this point, there's no turning back. Are you sure about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Of course I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We are the Blade Fox Corps. Everything has led us to this moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Plus...it's not just the two of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Right. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Nonsense! Do I look okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Please, wait for us here. The two of us can handle this on our own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'd ask you to wait until I can move again, but time is not on our side. I'll be right behind you as soon as I'm able.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Do your best to hold the line until I can join you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Tch. Blasted wounds! Hurry up and heal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What are you still doing here? Get a move on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Before I go, I just wanted to say...if something should happen to me, I'd like you to look after Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Why are you asking me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Because you're the person I trust most in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, you'll have to look elsewhere, as I have no time for that kind of hassle in my life. And I'll hear no more of this pessimistic poppycock, either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You are my right arm. Failure is inconceivable. Even if you were to die, I've no doubt you'd still complete your mission from beyond the grave. Such is the faith I have in Second Squad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So right now, you need only concern yourself with carrying out your duty as vice-captain. And that's an order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Y-yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Azami?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Let's go reclaim that happy everyday life we once had.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I've had my fill of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We'll be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We won't go down. Not yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>At least not until we've fulfilled our oaths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You're shaking, Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So are you, Azami.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's just adrenaline, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Three, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Four!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>That's five!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I was quicker than you on that last one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What are you talking about?! It was me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>No, it was me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>No, me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Six!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Seven!</td>

<td>Eight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Nine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ten!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>A single meal is mightier than the single blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I say it's time for lunch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>N-not yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ready your katana!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But I'm so hungry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Who cares about lunch! Today's the day that—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I said who cares about lunch! We have more—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Amane, don't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Oh, uh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Who cares about lunch?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Shouldn't have said that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Amane, I still see hesitation in your blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Observe your opponent and read their intentions as though you are them. Then end them with one deadly strike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Azami, you should yield more of yourself to your comrades. Allow them to cover your back. You must do so to your opponent, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>To my opponent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yes. Yield to their movements and you will be able to prevent or parry their strikes with smooth, fluid motions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Try not to be so obstinate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>The hands that grip your weapon, those mouths that talk back, and the brains that you need to keep coming up with half-baked ideas... All of those are made of the meals you eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>If you do not eat, you will have no strength to even lift a finger. Do you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>We do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Life is nothing if you don't live it, and food is what keeps you alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>So, to insult food is to insult life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Do you think someone who would insult life itself can be a proper member of the Corps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>No, we don't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Three meals a day is the foundation of life! Strength of mind and body comes from a hearty meal! Say it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Strength of mind and body comes from a hearty meal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Meals and blades are made to what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>To vanquish all demons who bring pain and suffering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>To bring about blissful days of joy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>With our blades, we will clear the way for Wadatsumi's future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Good! Now let's have lunch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I've made your favorites today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>All of your dishes are my favorites, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Oh, I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>So what did you make?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>A lot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Aaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Azami!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Ngh! Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Come on... Doesn't matter how many of you there are, I'll take all of you on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Move! Get out of my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Azami!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Taste the Kagomurasaki's secret art...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Amane!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Wh-why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Agh! A-Azami!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Azami...you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Ngh... N-nrrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I can't believe this... I-I'm not edible, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Grrrrgh... Grrrraaaaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>L-let's go home. Please? We can have a really delicious meal once we get back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Gaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Azami, stop! No... Please! Azami!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>We're supposed to vanquish all demons who bring pain and suffering, remember?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>We swore to bring about blissful days of joy! Don't you remember?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>We said that with our blades, we will clear the way for Wadatsumi's future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>We swore it together, Azami!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Don't say it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>"Kill me."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Please...! Don't say such a thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Fate cannot be overturned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Y-you again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>None can turn falsity into truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>If one's hopes are severed without ever knowing the truth, then one will travel down a path far different from what they were meant for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Hopes...severed...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Indeed. Even I cannot measure the impact such a thing would have upon this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Is that why you're here, talking to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Do you or do you not seek the true path?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Will you live a life of falsehood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Or will you choose death?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Death...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Without fulfilling my oath?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>That is indeed an option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>I... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>An empty fate in which you are destined to fade without reaching the truth. A life which will end without ever seeing the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>It is your choice to make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I... I choose to see the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Then I shall observe every aspect of the choice you make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Now, child molded by the land of sin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Show me the answer the truth guides you to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Amane, I still see hesitation in your blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Observe your opponent and read their intentions as though you are them. Then end them with one deadly strike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Okay.</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>I...choose to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Celis... Azami...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Whaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Aaaahh! Waaaaaaaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Why are you crying? You came here prepared to kill, didn't you? Then you should also be prepared to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>That person is no longer here. And I aim to sever the ties that bind him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Will you not ready your weapon, at the very least?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Very well. Then death it shall be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>I thought I'd killed you last time. It seems I haven't yet acclimated to this new host.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>But there won't be a next time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Tch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>I follow you all the way here just to find you loafing about, rookie? Ready your weapon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Where's Azami?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Over...there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>So right now, you need only concern yourself with carrying out your duty as vice-captain. And that's an order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Y-yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>All the more reason to ready your weapon, rookie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Don't you see? Azami isn't truly dead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Have you forgotten our most crucial creeds?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Never turn your back on a demon! Not under any circumstances!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>But, I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>Turning your back on a demon is no different than throwing away your life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Turning your back on a demon is turning your back on all those noble souls who've departed us along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>So take responsibility! Bear this burden! If you don't get up this instant, then Azami really will just be dead, and she'll have died in vain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Weren't you going to save Wadatsumi?! Well, if that's all the resolve you've got in you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>...then I don't see how you'll be able to save anything at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>"A member of the Blade Fox that is bitten by a demon must be purged by their squad before they themselves turn into a demon." You did what you had to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>And the souls of the lives you take reside in your sword. So Azami still lives! You've seen to it that she'll be with you forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Therefore, you mustn't lose heart! You must fight on, for you and for her alike! Brandish the pride of the Blade Fox!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>How absurd. "Mustn't lose heart"? You're living in a fantasy. Though you won't need to live in it much longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>And you can shut your mouth! We are humans. And Blade Fox, at that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>You should know what that means, if you have any connection at all to the person whose body you now inhabit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>We fight to the end as Blade Fox. If we don't, then our very existence has served no meaning from the start. And that's one thing I will never accept.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>We are Blade Fox until our very last gasp. That is the tribute we offer to the souls who came before us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>No. All it is is hogwash.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>Are you really gone, Tanosuke? Is there really no part of you that remains in there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Just remember I won't hold back if you turn on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>Of course—I wouldn't have it any other way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>If Tanosuke is truly gone...then I will show you no mercy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>Let's see what you're made of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>I told you this was absurd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>I really...do...hate you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>That just leaves you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>I'd suggest you not resist. You'll be at peace soon enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>What?! That technique...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>Book Two, Tigris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>...I can't die yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>This is all completely useless. You're wasting what little time you have left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240</td>
<td>It's over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>241</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>243</td>
<td>That's...what you get.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Urgh...</td>

<tr>
<td>248</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi!</td>

<tr>
<td>249</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>250</td>
<td>Inconceivable...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>251</td>
<td>Urk!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>252</td>
<td>No! Captain Ugachi! Your sword arm...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>253</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ngh! How...dare you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>255</td>
<td>No...</td>
