<td>Sophia?! Wh-why would you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Do I need a reason to help a friend in need?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I...!</td>

<tr>

<td>Wha—?!</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That elf always gives us trouble, so we brought some reinforcements this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(I can easily take care of these guys myself, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(If they find out that I really am a monster...a demon...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Even your freakishly strong monster of a friend here can't handle all of us at once. Now, come along quietly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>A monster? Are you referring to my friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sophia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The only monsters I see here are you! You hurt others without remorse.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(If they find out I'm a demon, they'll do terrible things to me. They might kill me like they killed my father...but...)</td>

<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wh-what the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(I don't care anymore! I can't let them take Sophia, even if it means they find out about me. She called me her friend—I won't turn my back on her!)</td>

<td>Grrraaaaaaaarrgh!</td>

<td>Miss Itsuki...</td>

<td>Sophia... Did I frighten you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Not at all. How could I be scared of a friend who fought for my sake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Sophia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I must apologize. I saw the truth about you when I read your fortune.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So I know what you are, and I know why you are here in Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's why I know that you are a good person. I have already seen that a peaceful relationship between you and humankind lies in store for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Humans have persecuted my people. I can't just forget that history, and it won't ever fade away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>So it's hard for me to believe your words, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I guess I could let myself trust you...as my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And maybe I can believe that someday I will find a human who I can call my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ugh! All this thinking has made me hungry! I want some of that lady's cooking again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Come to think of it, I didn't actually get to eat earlier, because of those men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh, my...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Pfft! Hahahaha! That was some tummy rumble, Sophia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hmhm. I suppose I must be hungrier than I thought!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>All right! Let's go get something to eat!</td>
