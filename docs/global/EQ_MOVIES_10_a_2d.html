<td>U-um... Th-thanks.</td>

<td>Edgar. I knew I could count on you to keep her safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Logi. So that was you, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yep. But I didn't come here alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm glad you're safe, Kasumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Tina! I'm so glad you're here! Liz... Is Liz all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>She's resting in the Cavern of Curing. Flappy's with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Curing...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Lisbeth...is being taken by the Darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>She saved you by taking the Darkness that enveloped you into her own being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If we do not defeat the Destrolurk, she will likely remain in that state...indefinitely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Allow me to apologize. We shouldn't have left you out of such an important discussion, especially one that concerned your fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>My name is Logi Crowley. No need to ask for your name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Right now, our allies are preparing for an all-out attack. We are going to defeat the Destrolurk and free the Tower of Babel and the Grand Excelsior both.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This is surely our last chance...our final stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We have absolutely no right to ask you to sacrifice yourself for us; nor should we. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Even knowing that, for the sake of all those innocent lives who would otherwise be lost, I have to ask you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Please... Save us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Kasumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'll do it. I'm...not sure if I will be able to use my powers again, but even so, I... I have to save Liz!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Even with your powers, Kasumi...in order to defeat the Destrolurk, you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'll be destroyed... But that's not set in stone, is it? Things might be different this time around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That is...possible, butâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Besides, standing still won't get us anywhere, so...I'll do it. Please, let me help you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Thank you, Kasumi. The fate of this world rests on your shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>They must know of our plan! If we don't begin the attack soon, all will be lost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I suppose there's nothing else for it. We've just gotta do it. I've made up my mind...and so have you, right, Kasumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Right!</td>
