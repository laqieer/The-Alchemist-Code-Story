<td>Welcome back.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm...so glad you're alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Same here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Do you have any idea how much I...I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh, come on. Don't start crying on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm not crying, you're crying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yeah, well... Did you call her Kagura earlier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes. She is the daughter of the Queen of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So one who carries the Wadatsumi royal bloodline yet lives. Lady Kagura, I'm so glad to see that you are well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There's no need to be so formal. I'm just another member of the Holy Guard now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>She fights as a Paladin of the 4th Regiment, of which I am the captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hah! You're the captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Do you have something to say about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So you're protecting her, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well, you know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes, he is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And now she works under you... Fate works in mysterious ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm so thankful you're alive. There could be no better news than this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I am unworthy, but I thank you, Lady Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>She just said there's no need to be so formal. So, since that day, how have youâ€”?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Um! Do you two know each other? You called Captain Kudan your brother just now, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I guess you could say we're blood brothers. We swore an oath to each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Is it really so surprising?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes, it is! I can't believe what I'm hearing! Captain Kudan has a blood brother?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I had no idea. What does that even mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I didn't expect this reaction. Looks like you're still not that open with your friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Drop it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>How did you two come to know each other, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's not important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh, tell us! Please? Basheeny, you want to know, too, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I am interested.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>See?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>May I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Have it your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Please tell us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Kudan came to Wadatsumi to study, as part of his training for the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>His powers were something to take note of, even back then. He was quite popular in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Those who saw his powers set up an exhibition match for him against me. I was just a member of a warrior family back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So you two fought, huh? Who won?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hahah. It was a long time ago. I don't exactly remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>There's no need to be so coy about it. That's a bad habit of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Wait, you don't mean...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yes. I couldn't defeat him. Not even once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Let's call it a day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No! Let's have another round! I won't back down until I defeat you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The sun's going down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I don't care!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I have plans tonight. Besides, I hate fighting in the dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Another round!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Fine. Come on, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You're too straightforward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You have no place to go, no back up, and no one to depend on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I have strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That you do, but you're still focused on nothing but me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Of course I am. So what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You're turning a blind eye to everything else around you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I bet you haven't even noticed the lovely sunset.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I've seen it before. Nothing new there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You're a real drag, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>It's the same sunset every day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Ack...urgh...ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>See? Looks different now, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Ack...! Kuza, you...! Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Ack! Urgh...! Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Heh. You need to loosen up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>Watch flowers bloom in spring. Skip work during the day and work nights instead in the summer. Make a campfire from dried leaves in autumn, and sleep in on the cold days of winter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Appreciate the subtle differences in how wine can taste depending on the scenery before you. It's as simple as that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'm telling you why it is you can't beat me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You're saying I should waste my time staring at the scenery?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You're not getting it. These things are fun because they're such a waste of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I'm really not getting this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Take a long look at everything around you. You'll learn to appreciate it all in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The more time you spend with things, the more you come to love them. You wouldn't call love a waste of time, now, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Heh. You love to hear yourself talk, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Though I may no longer have a family, I still have a home and a place I belong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Every day I find something new to love. Our strength is meant to be used to protect those things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Kuza...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Why did you become a Paladin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>To build a world in which people can smile freely. To protect the peace of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Are you serious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>You doubt me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>It's just that that's such a grand ideal and, well...you don't exactly look like the hero type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>That was a joke. You're supposed to laugh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I... I'm terrified. I feel like if I let my eyes drift away from that ideal for even a moment, I'll fall into the abyss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>That's...quite a thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Are you patronizing me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Not at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Still, your immediate objective is to be stronger than me. Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I'll defeat you. You'll see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Maybe we can help each other grow strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I...suppose that's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Guess that'd make us brothers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>What? And here I thought you were sober.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I want to grow stronger so that I can protect the things I see around me, and you want to grow stronger for the sake of a grand ideal. Don't you think we share a similar goal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I...suppose so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Why don't we make an oath to solidify our brotherhood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Not up for it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Tell me something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>There are no secrets between blood brothers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Which of us would be the older brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Hah! Hahahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Don't laugh! If we are to be brothers...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I'll be the older brother, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I knew it. You're drunk, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Isn't it natural for the stronger one to be the older brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>That has nothing to do with it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Don't go throwing a tantrum, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Don't treat me like a little brother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>It's nice to have a new family member.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I'm not familiar with Wadatsumi's customs. What exactly do I need to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>We just swear loyalty to each other as blood brothers, and then make an oath upon the blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I swing my blade for the sake of the people and land before me. Wadatsumi is my home to defend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>You really are drunk, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Don't worry. I'll share some with you later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I can't believe it. So you are drunk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Come on, repeat after me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I swing my spear to tear down all irrationalities and trample over all despair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Let us pledge an oath to grow stronger together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>For whom do we make this oath?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>For the people and their smiles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Kudan? Come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>For the peace of this continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>We will dedicate our lives to this path we walk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>For justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Wow... That's some story. I didn't think people still did that. Kagura, want to make a blood oath with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Just like that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Soon after that, Kudan left Wadatsumi. Or I guess I should say, he was forced to leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Greed Dike invaded Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I couldn't save anything back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>That's not true. You saved Kagura's life. That's more than enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Let me just check that I understand this correctly. The weak get exploited. That's why Captain Kudan obsesses over strength?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Basheeny! Can't you word things in a way that's not disrespectful to your captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Captain Kudan! I'll be sure to lecture him properly later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Basheeny! Apologize this instant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Did I say something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Just apologize already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>I'm...sorry. I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>We're with you now, Captain Kudan! We won't let you lose anyone ever again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Even if you get enveloped in the darkest abyss, I will shine a light on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Airhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>What was that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Where do you get all that baseless cheerfulness from, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>I'm just saying what I think is right! Isn't it human nature to want to shine a light upon the dark and gloomy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>You think I'm gloomy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Oh, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Can't you word things in a way that's not disrespectful to your captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Ahem... Right. I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Oh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Kuza...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>It's...nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>So what have you been doing lately?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Whatever I can for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Wadatsumi still suffers the tyranny of Greed Dike's occupation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Civilians are being massacred and used to conduct experiments regarding the undying soldiers known as the Immortals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>That's horrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>The Immortals? Then those soldiers from earlier were...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Not only did they invade our home, but they've treated us worse than chattel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>This cannot be allowed to continue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>That's why there's a resistance working to change the current state of affairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>A resistance, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Yes, but Greed Dike is aware of our operation. If we were to make any large-scale moves, we'd have another invasion on our hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>We won't let that happen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Will you lend me your strength, Brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Of course. The fact that there are Immortals in Greed Dike and that Wadatsumi's Alchemia is being used to fuel them, coupled with your testimony... This is more than enough evidence for us to take action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>We can make this an official operation of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Let's report back to the Lord Commander. Then we should formally request the Holy Order for permission to support Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Before we leave, I want to show you our hideout to give you a better understanding of what is happening here. Would that be all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Lead the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Follow me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Please... Save...Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>I can no longer perform the dance...that you said you loved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Chihaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>So...let me at least...pray for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Chihaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>I pray you will reach the heights you...have always aspired for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>No substantial information yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>No, sir. What should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>We investigated every lead we have, but not a single trace of the archeologists was found.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>If nothing turns up soon, we'll have to assume that they've destroyed whatever evidence there might have been to find.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Indeed... What do you make of this, Othima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>It is odd. If they were so careful as to not leave any evidence, why did they allow themselves to be seen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>You have a point. If their intent was to be thorough, it doesn't make any sense that they'd allow their Phantom to be exposed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Are you suggesting that it was intentional?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>It is a possibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>What would the point of that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>This whole thing could be a setup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>What if it was a plan to draw Captain Kudan to Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Tch! Greed Dike soldiers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>We've lost sight of Kuza.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>They must feel considerably threatened. Let's find Kuza first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Here they come!</td>
</tr>
