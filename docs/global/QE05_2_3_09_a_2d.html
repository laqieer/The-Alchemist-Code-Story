<td>Urgh...</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Well, well, well. Not bad. I suppose I should have expected that a Phantom could take so much damage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wh...at...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You were transmuted into a Phantom with the last of Sephiron's power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>A Phantom?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No human body could withstand the power of the Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Honestly, such a frail vessel only limits how one can use the power from that place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Rejoice, Kamui! The Alchemy Source itself had a hand in making you the way you are now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Why, Lord Waginau?! Do you truly crave power so badly? Are you not the one who taught me that excessive power is what destroys people?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Such words mean nothing to me. They are just wasted air in the face of the Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Rise and face me, Kamui! Or are you just as weak as the others?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Have you lost your fighting spirit? Where is your conviction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Speak, Kamui! Answer me! Have you resigned yourself to death in this absurd world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Are you willing to allow all the blood spilled the day that Sephiron withered and died to have been spilled in vain?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Lord Waginau...I don't think I can understand what you're trying to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>However, I know that you are wrong! At least I know that much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ouroboros once told me that I would be able to call forth the forgotten legacies of warriors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So many have fallen; so many hearts and hopes were lost... Yet I cannot believe that it was all for nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It was not for nothing that they risked their very lives following the paths they chose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>O Sephiron, I call forth! Grant me the strength to resist, the will to protect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No, that light...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Finally! Kept me waiting, didn't you, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>T-Teona?! Is it really you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah, it's me! I've been on the edge of my seat this whole time, waiting for this moment to come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Finally...? Hmph. Foolish disciple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Show me your strength! Prove yourself to me!</td>
