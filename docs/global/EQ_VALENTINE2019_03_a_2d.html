<td>Itsuki, don't tell me you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's right. I am descended from the demons you humans have hated and feared for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Demons, huh? I've never heard of anything like that, so I'm not exactly sure what to think of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's news to me as well... Do you know anything about this, Noah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Not really. Wadatsumi never really came up in my studies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Suzuka, you're from Wadatsumi, aren't you? What can you tell us about demons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I've only ever heard stories of them from my grandmother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The place where I grew up never really had many dealings with demons, so I've never actually met one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Besides, my training has kept me away from Wadatsumi for a long time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hmph. While you've all been living your carefree lives, my people have been suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You humans have always discriminated against us demons, and we've had to live in fear of the hateful gazes you turn upon us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's why I can't bring myself to like humans. And I certainly don't want to be here, helping humans out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It is true that I have never spared much thought for the circumstances of demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Nonetheless, you have no right to judge us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Is it just me, or is the mood getting a bit hostile here? What should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I... I have no idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Maybe it's time for the Rainbow Cacao to save the day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ohh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's a great idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Come to think of it, it was thanks to the Rainbow Cacao that I found the courage to apologize to you, Emma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then come on! There's still some over there that we haven'tâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Thieves! Cacao thieves! Oh, dear. Why did it have to be now?!</td>
