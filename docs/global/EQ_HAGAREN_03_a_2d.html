<td>Engine's fried. Well, putting five people on a motorcycle and going full speed will do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>General, you doing all right? I'm sure it was a bit of a shock, being betrayed like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>At least we were able to minimize casualties on both sides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>All I can think is that we only made it this far because of you and your motorcycle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Looking on the bright side, eh? Not my style, but power to you. I respect that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>General Toritoh, I maintain that arrogance is one of your less admirable qualities, but trying to prevent your men from needlessly losing their lives is worth my re-evaluation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Colonel Mustang... That was a pretty arrogant thing to say, yourself. Maybe your ego is smarting after losing to the alchemy of all those soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If anyone lost face, it was me. I was born with power beyond that of any normal human. That is why they made me General...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But power is all I have. When it comes to technique or skill, I am no equal to you. Without my alchemy, I wouldn't even be a match for Edgar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So you were born with it...? I've heard plenty of stories of people who wanted the power that comes with alchemy and were destroyed by it in the end...but being born with it must have its downsides, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No, I've been lucky. I have never experienced any real hardship in my life; not until recently, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Who could've expected to find someone like that embedded in the Holy Guard? How are we gonna deal with that blond shrimp?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Just to be safe... You should know: if you ever meet my brother for real, you'd better not call him that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>G-got'cha. So General, what're you gonna do? It's not like you can go back to the Holy Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'll report him to the top brass. They won't tolerate such disrespect from an outsider. I expect they will punish him severely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I wouldn't, if I were you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's a terrible idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I wouldn't recommend that course of action. We still don't know who's behind this. With your temperament, you could end up taking the heat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>When you don't know who your enemy is, it's better to lay low for a while until you get a better idea of how to handle them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see... Very well, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm quite the traveler, so I know some good hideouts...but we can only run from the Holy Order for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Perhaps my Phantoms can be of use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Your Phantoms? Are you going to use them to fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No. I have certain Phantoms who are skilled in negotiation and the gathering of information. If I were to employ them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, they might not be all that useful, but even Edgar is doing his part by facilitating our escape by bike. I wish to do whatever is in my power, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>In that case, be my guest. In the meantime, we'll get rid of... some pests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>To think the Holy Order's sinister reach extends this far! General, we'd better find you a safe house as soon as possible.</td>
