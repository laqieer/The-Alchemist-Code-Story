<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Amane, how are you managing over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh, I'm good! ...Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Amane?! Dear me! I forgot how much energy it takes for you to keep us all here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Please do not concern yourself with me. This is my burden to bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ohh! You've become so strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...I had a good role model.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well, if you're sure you can keep it up, then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Are we really just going to...eat? At a time like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Did... Did you just make light of the need to eat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Uh-oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ouch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Three meals a day is the foundation of life! Strength of mind and body comes from a hearty meal! Say it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Say it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>S-strength of mind and body comes from a hearty meal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There we go. Now, then... Let's get some food in you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What a beautiful spread, wouldn't you say? So... Bon appetit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Thank you, Celis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Mmm! This is amazing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Right? Celis is the best cook ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But, uh... What is it, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's the problem with trying to cook inside a dagger world. You can't go fighting on an empty stomach, but ingredient options are awfully limited here. I only could make some simple rice balls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>They're a common dish among those in Wadatsumi, so I hope you'll find them to your liking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh? So this is part of day-to-day life among the people here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's right. Of course, it isn't all they eat, but it's definitely a staple of the lifestyle here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Though now there are people who can't even enjoy such modest pleasures due to the evil that threatens the land. Even a modest gathering like this is a thing of the past for many of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...Those poor people were robbed of everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Exactly. It's truly heartbreaking. There's no way to change the past, but I know the two of you can change the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The...two of us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I've passed on, so I can't do anything more out there myself, unfortunately. But I know in my heart what you're capable of. You're my son. Mine and Zeke's. It's in your blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You've truly grown so big. Must be all that milk you drank when you were a child. You refused to drink anything else. How old were you when you broke out of that habit, I wonder?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm sorry... I don't remember anything from back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I understand. You were still so young. To think, I left you before I could ever see you grow into the man you are now... I can never apologize enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm so sorry, Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh? Celis' dagger has started glowing again! What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oopsie-daisy! Looks like he's a little restless. Such a feisty little one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I told you he might wake up if you stared at him too hard! People can sense that, you know. I understand, it's...hard not to look. But you have to give him a little space sometimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ah, well. There, there. It's okay! Daddy's here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm sorry for waking you up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(Father? What...is this voice?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(Are these...my memories?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Sorry, Logi. We were a little too noisy, weren't we? Let me wipe off some of that drool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(Wait! I know that handkerchief!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Well, isn't this just perfect? Let's all have some lunch together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(...!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>How lovely. The entire family around the dinner table. I couldn't ask for a more perfect moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Right? Well, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Let's dig in, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Logi's been so good about drinking his milk lately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>He's definitely going to grow up big and strong. Look at him, already learning his first words and starting to walk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Kids grow up so quickly. He'll be running around and getting himself into trouble before we know it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I know it's a bit silly, but I'll rather miss these days of wiping drool when he gets older.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I pray that he'll get to grow during a time of peace across these lands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Yeah... Me too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(Ah...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I wonder what kind of man you'll be. Well, as long as you live a happy life, it doesn't really matter, does it? You can be whatever you wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Cherish your everyday life, my precious son. I just hope beyond that we can always have some small part in it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>(...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I'll be there by your side, whenever I possibly can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>(Ah!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Stop saying that! You'll jinx it. They say making promises like that invites bad luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Haha, I suppose you're right. But that's enough talk for now! The food's getting cold. Let's finish our lunch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Well... I'd better get going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>All right. Though, what do you want to do about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>The dagger? What do you mean? I said before, we're to pass it to Logi when he grows up. It's to be a symbol of our thoughts and prayers for his future success and happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I know. But since that was your idea, I thought you should be the one to give it to him. So I'd like you to hang onto it, until that day comes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I'll still continue sending my prayers to it as well, from afar. I won't forget.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>All right. If you insist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Though, on the subject of Logi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Don't worry, I'll work twice as hard to raise him, for the both of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...This might the last time I'll be able to wipe your tears away, little one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Please, be happy. And know that even if I can't be by your side...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I'll aways be thinking of you. You will always have a place in my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>The everyday life I'll be fighting for from here on out will no longer be one that includes you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...but I hope you'll find an everyday life of your own one day, that's worth just as much to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>(Aah...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I guess this is the end. I can't even move my body. All that's left for me now is to pray.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>At least I can still send my prayers to you, even while we're apart... And even in death, I pray that my wishes for you will still be granted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I put all my thoughts, wishes, and prayers into this dagger, so...Amane, may you inherit it, and pass it along to my dear son.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I've never stopped thinking about him since then. I've never stopped wishing for all the best things in life to come his way. I hope that somehow, those feelings have reached him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>(Aah...aaah...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>My friends... My comrades... Amane... Logi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I couldn't make our wishes come true, but please...continue to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>...protect...the sanctity...of your daily lives...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>(You... You took it so far...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>So...this is what it means...to connect with the thoughts and emotions...inside in an object...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Amane?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I never knew Father could smile like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I never knew that we had such warm and lovely meals together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Logi, you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Can I ask you something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Of course! Anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>The everyday lives and livelihoods you fought to protect in Wadatsumi...are countless, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Well, of course! And they meant even more to me when I considered your father's and...your connection to this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>That's why I fought as a captain in the Blade Fox to the very end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>That's what I thought. And I think I've finally found the commonality in the daily lives we each put ourselves out there for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>And I swear I will continue to protect Wadatsumi in your place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I will fully inherit your will. Because I, too, want to protect this everyday life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Your feelings, and your prayers...have indeed reached me, loud and clear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I'm so glad. You've grown into such a fine young man, Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Amane! You can't keep going like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Thank you, Amane. Remember to eat properly. I hope you'll stay well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Celis... I promise we'll return peace to Wadatsumi. We'll protect this place. You have my word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Mother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Amane, thank you for calling me here. And Logi... Thank you for calling me Mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>The rice balls were delicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Thank you for the hearty meal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Logi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I'm ready now, Amane. I can feel it. I appreciate you keeping this active for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>My mother cherished Wadatsumi just as dearly as you. She gave her life to protect it, just as you no doubt would in a heartbeat. So I, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>...will defend it to my last breath!</td>
</tr>
