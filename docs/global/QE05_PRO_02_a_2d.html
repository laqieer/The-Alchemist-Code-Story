<td>Whoa, she's fast! She's definitely an experienced fighter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Tell me what I want to know! I do not wish to kill anyone...if I do not have to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Gah! I never expected a cutie like you to be so skilled with a sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>A cu—?! That's enough of your blithering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Where did she...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What a shallow fool! I will not let your words bewilder me anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>B-behind me?! Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wha...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Where are you aiming? Is it not clear to you that you cannot defeat me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You try to act all sneaky, but you're actually a pretty honorable fighter, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What does that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The way you strike, straight and true... It shows that you aren't used to dirty fighting, meaning that you prefer to fight fair and square.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A steel beam?! Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He was aiming for the beam the whole time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yep, all so I could position myself behind you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Checkmate. Now, I've got a few questions for you. Why are you after the man with red hair?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Can't you hear them? The lamentations of the ancient ones...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I can hear them; the wailings of a people exploited and decimated for being so pure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>People? What people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I cannot allow myself to repeat their tragedy as their cries of grief echo in my ears. I cannot allow myself to be another meek fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What the...? A black puddle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Beast Art Evocations! Book Two, Snake Bind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ink?! Wait, a ribbon?! Urgh, I-I can't move! What the hell is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>These bindings, once they find their target...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There is no limit to its ability to constrict. Do you know what this means?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If I allow it to, it could rip through your body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>R-rip?! Wait, wait, wait! That is so not okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I already vaguely planned on dying of old age!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Then just answer my questions. Where is the red-haired man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh, come on! You're sealing my fate one way or the other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What? Do you mean revealing this man's location will get you killed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No, that's not what I mean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm saying I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I were to sell out my friend! I'd rather die now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Wha...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Let me make this clear. Living just to survive is no way to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The value of your life is set by how you choose to live!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute! I was, uh, just showing off! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Uh, why are you putting your sword away? You're not gonna beat me to death now, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You would choose death over betraying your friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>History is built upon betrayal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Those who are persecuted in the end are always the ones with pure and noble souls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>H-hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The pure and noble souls are persecuted? What was up with her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Well, looks like Ronnie was right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Good to see you, Edgar L. Leonhart. Uh...I didn't know you were into this sort of thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You're one of Don Taras'...! Glad you're here! Can you do something about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I have to catch that girl before she causes more trouble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Girl? Where do you plan to go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It won't be long before she finds that place! If I don't catch her, it'll mean I let a dangerous girl roam free!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I have to hurry to that shady city, Lost Blue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>So this is how they hide the entrance to deter outsiders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Sure is. Are you sure about this? This is some high quality fabric. Like, it's from Wadatsumi or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It's fine. You provided me with information worth its price. I still owe you thanks for leading me out of there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I would have been lost on my own. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Don't even worry about it! Haha! This'll fetch me a sweet price!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>A long-haired knight of the Holy Guard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I never expected Lost Blue, once known as "the sunken city that light does not reach", to be so bright and lively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It's hard to believe the Templars came from there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Of course this place is lively. People who've lost their place in the world gather here from across the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Without a better outlet for all that dynamic energy, it all gets focused on keeping this place running.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Well, there is some support coming in from Slothstein that helps, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>And you are...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I was informed about a girl that no one recognizes entering that city. I just came to see who it could be. Did you enjoy your time there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>So you came to defend your territory? Do not worry. My business is done here. Farewell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hold it. You're the one that covered some of my people in ink, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Some of them are seriously injured. Your method of asking for directions is a little too violent, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>So you're here for retaliation? If I may say, it was those men who provoked a fight in the first place. There is no reason for me to have to deal with this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Nevertheless, those idiots were bested by such a pretty bonny? That's a little embarrassing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>A p-pretty bo—?! You're being ridiculous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What's this? Are you blushing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>N-no! Anyway, I have no business with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Oh, but I have business with you. Sorry, but you're coming with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Agh?! Ow! Who just shot at my arm?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>That was close... Hey! You okay there, power-fist?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Comb-head?! What...?! When did you get back to town?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Wait, hey! I was helping you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hold on. Don't move. I'd rather not get rough with a lady if I can avoid it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>La...dy? Do you mean me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I don't see anybody else here that word could apply to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>S-stop it! Ridiculous! If you aren't here to tell me where the red-haired man is, then you're wasting my time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>It's actually you who'll be doing the talking. I still have a lot to ask you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>You just don't give up, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Try and stop me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Tch! I knew it'd come to this! Let's go, top-heavy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Don't tell me what to do, washout!</td>
</tr>
