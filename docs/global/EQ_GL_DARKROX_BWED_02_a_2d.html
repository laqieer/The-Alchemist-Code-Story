<td>001</td>
<td>I didn't know why I wanted to see him again, honestly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I was being impulsive. Reckless. And I could get caught at any moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Would he even come?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Who was I even doing it for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That will be all, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ah, before you go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The Director would like to see you after you have taken your ease. Something about a new mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This way, my lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(I wonder why Grimm wasn't there at the review...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(He couldn't have seen me let that man go, could he?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>My lady, is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...No. I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Lead the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The main hall was much larger than I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Something about the place made me uneasy, and it wasn't just the scale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Eventually, after countless winding corridors, we arrived at a single steel door.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Subject R, Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The Director raises a hand, and the handmaiden dips her head before leaving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You wanted to see me, Director?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The Director's shaded hood was in the way, but I got the distinct feeling I was being studied rather intently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What do you know of Subject VI?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I assume Grimm has mentioned her in passing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Subject VI has been declared missing for well on a month, with few to no traces of her activities around the borders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>In light of this, scouts have been withdrawn for the time being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The Director holds out a scrap of paper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(An address and a contact.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The caretaker of the care center Subject VI was fond of visiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I have informed them to observe the premises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I expect you to be on standby at a moment's notice, and to dispose of her should you sight her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Grimm has been notified of your mission. This shall take precedence over your other duties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Understood, Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It wasn't my place to question the Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Without Grimm breathing down my neck, though, I had the freedom to entertain that spark of madness in my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Of course, I didn't know if that man would even come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Siegfried. The mysterious link to my past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But some things have a knack of catching up with you sooner rather than later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>- Archives, Main Hall -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No human guards?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>None. They are patrolled exclusively by robots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The better to keep their secrets, I'm guessing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>This way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>- Archives, East Wing -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Are we even heading in the right direction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Truthfully? I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>There's no time to comb through every one of these archives, so we'll have to make do with what we can access.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Good enough for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Wait. Something's coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>PRESENCE DETECTED.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Stay in the shadows. Let me handle this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Here on official directive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>STATE YOUR IDENTITY.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Roxanne- Subject R.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>CHECKING...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>NO PERMISSION RECORDS FOUND.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY WILL BE REPORTED-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>BZZT... SHUTTING DOWN.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It was worth a try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I...guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We'd best keep moving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
