<td>Gather round!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We are about to begin the training session. But before we begin, be noted that there have been a number of incidents involving bandits in the area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The knights will handle the situations. But for you cadets, it is your duty to obsereve and report any suspicious activities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Right. Now let us begin. For today's session, this will be a joint session with the knights, so do you best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A training session with actual knights? I'm nervous…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hm? Why so nervous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, because they're the real deal. And I've never even seen one up close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And to be able to spar with real knights? This is a rare opportunity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, I guess for someone like you with a brother that's a knight… It's not a big deal for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I heard that Fraise was so great that he even received an award during training. Isn't that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's amazing. Gino, I'm sure you'll be just as great. I mean, you are his younger brother after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Again with that…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Nothing… Nevermind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(Everyone everywhere always saying "Fraise is great!" Ugh, I can't deal with it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(I want to lash out and release my frustrations, but I know if I do that, it would make things worse...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(He's only just become a captain. What does that have to do with me?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Ugh… So frustrating.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey, look! The knights!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hmm…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Perfect. I can let out some frustration through some sparring.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(The other cadets are a bit too weak. I'll be able to let out more strength against an actual knight.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…and that concludes the rules for today. But before we start, here is a word from the commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The knights that will take part in today's training session are the latest Royal Knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Simply stated, they are newcomers. They are close to you cadets in age and they should also be close in skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>For you boarding school cadets that will protect Envylia in the future as knights, take this as a grand opportunity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And now, let us begin training!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Um, You are my partner…? I mean, are you my partner?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yeah…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm Victor! Nice to meet you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>W-what's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>For a knight, you don't seem like much. How can I put it…? Like, weak looking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>These other cadets are no match for me, so I was looking forward to sparring with a real knight. But a newbie? What a disappointment…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>H-hey, what's wrong with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I…I mean, hey! You really shouldn't talk to a senior like that…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Stop that silly act… It's disgraceful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wha…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If you want respect from me, don't blabber. Show me with your sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I want a fight that I can put my power into. So show me what you got. Don't let your guard down or you'll get hurt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>With all my might then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You're a brat with some confidence. Alright then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>If that's what you want, let's have some fun.</td>
</tr>
