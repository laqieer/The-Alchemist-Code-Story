<td>002</td>
<td>A few days after Soren and Blair's harrowing escape from Goetia's hidden facility...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Professor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're up early, Blair. How are you feeling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Better. More importantly, I've figured out how to scrub the memory module.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Goetia shouldn't be able to recover it at this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You just survived an explosion and you're already back to work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Must you tease her so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We were all happy to see you back safely, at any rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah. It's all thanks to Blair's quick thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ugh... *cough*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Blair? Blair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm...definitely never doing that again if I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That was an emergency-use low power grenade, but with all the equipment in here, we could have been blown sky high...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, glad we're still in one piece, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Blair peers down at the prone forms of their two assailants, who don't seem to show any signs of movement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I think they're out cold, but for how long?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(Hang on, this feels like...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Soren? We should probably get moving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The air's thick with Alchemia. Look...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The cryotube in the center of the room now sports a large, conspicuous crack across its glass surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We need to get Lachesis out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Lachesis? Well... We're going to need help, that's for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Let's see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>BZZZZT... BZZT.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That should do it. Hope it doesn't decide to crush us with the cryotube.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You sure about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Unlikely. It's only a rudimentary hack, but this guard bot is pretty outdated for its time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Blair gives the ruined facility one last look before ordering the guard bot to detach the cryotube from its supports.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>BZZZT.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I think we should take her along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Red? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Her aura is truly something else...but I sense something different in it this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>And if my guess is correct, Lachesis might be able to help her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...If you say so, Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I don't think she has a good chance of surviving her punishment after this show of disobedience, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Nor I. I shudder to think what they will do to that poor child once word reaches their command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The best we can do for now is keep her here under watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>She is still breathing, and her wounds don't appear to be fatal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It remains to be seen whether she will awaken, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Scary lady...staying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Don't worry, Eira. She's in no condition to fight even if she were to turn hostile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Good, because I have some burning questions for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This isn't an interrogation, Siegfried. And there's no telling whether she knows anything about what happened to Roxanne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Whose side are you on, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>None of us stands to gain anything from another unnecessary casualty. I'm sure you know that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You assume a lot of things about me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Among them, a bleeding heart. Do not let anger blind your sense of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I would know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>If you're ready to head out, Soren, perhaps we should check on Lachesis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Yeah. We'll need to borrow Eira, too. I think she's more attuned to her than I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>In that case, I'll set up additional cloaking devices around the perimeter. It should help cover our tracks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Sounds good. Don't overwork yourself, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It's...not a problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Emrys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Eira...help Big Bro!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I trust you'll look after her in my stead, Professor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Siegfried and I will keep an eye on Red here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Then that's settled. Take care, my dears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I guess this place hasn't changed too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It is rather out of the way. And with nothing else of value, not even the most curious researcher could be bothered to descend into this overgrown tangle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>All the Alchemia tanks have long since drained, so it's unlikely there will be any more hungry beasts about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Pretty...singing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I suppose it's time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>A gentle, soft humming permeates the alcove.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Lachesis's cryotube begins to glow faintly in the darkness as the party approaches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>She appears to be responding to both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Compared to the Constructs we once faced here, the Alchemia she exudes is rather light and...quite pleasant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>That's good to hear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Eira, are you ready? Let's see if we can wake her up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>*growl*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Strange, it seems I was wrong about the beasts. But there is a lack of sustenance here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Or have they simply gone into hibernation? Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>We can examine them later! Eira, stay close to Professor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>My, how you've grown, Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>We won't be outdone, won't we, little one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Eira...fight!</td>
</tr>
