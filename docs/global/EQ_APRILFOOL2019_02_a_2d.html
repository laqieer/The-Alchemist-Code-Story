<td>Dias, are you still mad? If I offended you, I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Logi, you have to promise me you'll stop calling me Headstrong Dias in front of Agatha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What? Why? You were saying it yourself when you had those mushrooms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What? Me? When?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah, you. Don't tell me you don't remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I don't remember a darn thing. Those mushrooms are dangerous, and we should never eat them again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Then what is that you're eating right now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh, no! These are Alchemy Mushrooms!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This is starting to become a habit. Drop that mushroom! Give it here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wh-what are you going to do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm gonna flush this down the toilet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What?! N-no! Stop! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It had to be done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Logi! How dare you...! How dare you take away my... My precious...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I will kill you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Kill me? Over a mushroom?! You've got to be joking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This is no joke. I have a strong suspicion that I will eventually try to kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I even have a strong suspicion that I'll kill father before getting to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Spoilers! You're giving out spoilers! Headstrong Dias, you're going crazy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There you go, calling me that again! I'll kill you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I won't call you names anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We all have our individual ways of thinking. Don't worry about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Y-you're going to forgive me, just like that? You have got to get your emotions under control...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Our methodology may differ, but we're both aiming for a peaceful world without sorrow, right? Hehe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Haha! After all, we've become knights who can "create a world where Agatha can be happy."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You still remember that, Dias? Hahaha! Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What do you say we start doing stand-up together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Maybe even start a band?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You just considered it a little, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The monsters are growing powerful. Is it the effect of the Philosopher's Stones? </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We're getting closer to the ruins. If we hadn't discovered the Ab Breaker, we would probably be struggling a lot more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I agree with you wholeheartedly. For the sake of our army as it advances behind us, let's use our rock hard abs to annihilate the enemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The Ab Breaker... Hmm... An ab training machine, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh?! F-Father...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Father?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>So...the two of you have obtained the forbidden power, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>N-no! You've got it all wrong! The late night commercial said that the first ten callers would get a crystal dumbbell if they ordered this, so—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>W-we just wanted abs that could flatten our enemies like steel walls!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Enough excuses. Let me feel those washboard abs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huh? Uhhh, s-sure...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Now, let me see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Nnk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hm... Firm. Oh, how they remind me of solid plate armor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Father! Feel mine, as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>All right, let me see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ooh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, now. Your abs are as tough as the sole of a gorilla's foot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Father... Your metaphors are a little hard to relate to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Why don't you try the Ab Breaker out, Father?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I hear the TAC Producer uses it every day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What? Even the Producer uses it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>So that's where his massive ego comes from! All right, I'm going to buy myself one as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Get your abs rock hard with the Ab Breaker!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Boys... You... That insane cheer you just did, with your arms outstretched... Why, that's the Romance pose. Where did you learn such a thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>The other day, at Fort Aldrin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>W-we...were planning on telling you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Now, boys... You both know what power such a cheer holds, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It's an art forbidden under the Magna Code, established by the Alliance of the Seven Kingdoms of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>A strictly forbidden art, permitted only to be used by the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That's not what I mean. That cheer and the pop-culture arts were the cause of Wratharis' collapse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It's a power that can bring a kingdom to destruction; I'm asking you if you understand the meaning of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>B-but, we have no intention of exploiting this art!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What do you plan to use it for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I plan to use it to protect people without power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I plan to use it to change this world filled with sorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>My children have now been exposed to the turmoil of pop-culture, as I once was. Is this fate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Father, why do you know the Romance pose?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Listen. The heart of man is weak by nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>If you do not stay strong, you will be consumed instantly by the power, as I was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>There is no time for us to wait for the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>If it's to combat the pop-culture moves of the rebel army, then we've no other choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Swear to me that you will never allow yourself to be swallowed up by your power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I swear, Father!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Yes! I swear never to lose myself to this power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Very well. Let's cut through the forest. We're going to make a run for the Gilrack Ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>That's the bar where we're having the mixer. We'll have to walk right into the group of awaiting women. Keep your guard up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>U-um, wait! I feel it's too dangerous to charge in from the front, without knowing the target.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Maybe we could divide their seating arrangements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>If we arrange the seats as male, female, male, then everybody will be sitting next to a member of the opposite sex.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>That way, we can at least avoid having the women clustering and speaking only amongst themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Arriving late and forcing them to change seats might leave a bad impression. Who's going to make the suggestion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I will. I'm younger and cuter than you, Father. It should be easier for them to forgive me. Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Logi...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I will go too, Father! With the two of us, we should be able to keep the mood light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Hmph, very well. Remember, Agatha will know nothing of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>You boys will go in with a funky, spring break-vibe, and I'll close it all off with my dandyism. Maintain control of the situation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
