<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Though I made it inside with little difficulty, the security was tight, and I had no idea where Mikaboshi was being kept.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>But I could not fail in my journey to return Mikaboshi to Wadatsumi! I had to ensure I evaded capture, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>During one particularly harrowing encounter, in my desperation, I opened a nearby door and flung myself inside to hide from a patrol. And that's when I met him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Who goes there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...! I-I-I'm not anyone suspicious, I swear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So you're the intruder, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I...suppose I am, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What an unusual guest you are. There is another inside of you as well, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I presume this is what you're after.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh! That's...Mikaboshi's stone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hmm? Ah, I see. The one inside of you is the very reason you seek this artifact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...! How...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Shall I give it to you, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That...would be wonderful. But, why? Why are you making this so easy for me? Do you not represent the interests of Greed Dike?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I believe you are far better suited to bear it. Besides which, I'm curious to see where this leads. Who knows? It may even serve to give me hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Just who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>They call me the Sun King.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The Sun King?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I didn't believe it when I heard it either. But if not for that chance encounter, we may never have gotten our hands on Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I didn't know what it was he wanted, but it seemed to me his goals were not at all aligned with Judius'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Greed Dike may not be a monolith after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So the nation's true goal is still shrouded in darkness, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The Templars, and the Sun King... So closely tied to Greed Dike, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The Templars are long gone, as best as anyone knows. They were only active in the time of the Lion Monarch's Charge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Are you saying the man you met was merely using the Sun King's name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I can only assume as such, given what we know. But there's more still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What a peculiar thing to say. I, Zechs, would be very grateful if you might elaborate on what you mean by that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The name of the man in front of me was Zechsâ€”a name long associated with the Templars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmm. Indeed, that only further obfuscates their motives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No point thinking too hard about things we can't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What's important is, we have the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi, so we should be able to recover the sacred art of Kagutsuchi now, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's the big takeaway here, as I see it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes. Yes, you're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's true that our main worry is not the Sun King, but Judius. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The question remains as to whether or not Logi Crowley will really come to Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I believe he will. No... I know he will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's so hot! Crossing a desert after all that work getting here feels like we just have a death wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We must persevere. To defeat the Malice that's overtaken Wadatsumi, and return peace to the land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yeah, but do we really have to go all the way to Gluttony? We might not make it in time to do much of anything if we stray too far from Wadatsumi, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>There's no other way. The intel we received was thoroughly reliable. Logi is in Gluttony Foss, no doubt about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We have Mikaboshi, so everything now rides on Logi's return to Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Okay. But what if you went back to Wadatsumi, and I went to get Logi? Wouldn't that be a safer bet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's not that I don't trust you. I just want to tell him about what's going on in Wadatsumi myself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>And make sure he knows the way Wadatsumi is meant to be, as opposed to how it is now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yeah, but if you die in the process of getting to him, none of that's gonna do anybody any good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Even if it means risking my life, I must do this! For the future of the land I call home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Your resolution and conviction is every bit the equal of a knight's. I entreat that you permit me to deliver your message.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Who goes there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I apologize for eavesdropping, but it seems we share the same goals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You wish for the one named Logi Crowley to be led to Wadatsumi, is that correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yes, it is. But you haven't answered my question. Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>My name is Monzein. I was once a Captain of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It takes a great amount of work to secure the best possible future. Please, allow me to assist in that noble goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>But how can we know that you'll deliver the message? That you'll even be able to meet with Logi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I give you my word, on my pride as a knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Just as Sacred Stones are drawn together, so too do the bonds between people pull us ever closer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>So my meeting with Logi Crowley is nothing but a matter of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(I didn't necessarily believe that he really was who he claimed to be, but the look in his eyes and the tone of his voice somehow made me feel I could trust him.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(He will deliver my message, and he will lead Logi to Wadatsumi.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I believe I've done all that I can. All that remains now is to keep the faith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The bonds between us all will be the spark that leads to the resurrection of Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
