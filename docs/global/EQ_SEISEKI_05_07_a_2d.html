<td>Monzein...ack! If only you had lent an ear to what I was telling you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>All right stop. That's enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...now, now, don't you think you're going a little too far?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's really not funny anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Othima...you too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So scary! I told you not to stare at me with those frightening eyes of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Get out of the way, Othima, or else you'll end up getting hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Mm. Not likely. After all, the world's future is in the balance, and I am a knight of justice after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I see. Don't blame me if you end up regretting that choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh dear... You've become quite consumed by the darkness. You really did take the easy route.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The easy route...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Come now, don't get worked up. Because of our current situation, let me tell you this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You really shouldn't go any further. You don't wanna get swallowed up by the darkness, do you, captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The darkness...what do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...The Alchemia within you is too strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>On top of that, I heard that you have the potential to be easily swayed by darkness. It's a little dangerous to have the Mikaboshi—with all its hidden power—near you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Easily swayed by darkness? Me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I don't know the details, but, according to Lord Zain, your past plays a role in this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I don't know what kind of flawed conclusion you reached, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The reason why Lord Zain ordered you to stay back was out of a parental desire to prevent you from being consumed by the darkness. Don't misunderstand his intentions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In any case, I'll ask Zain myself. Move out of the way. I don't have time for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>In that case, I'll have to get past you by force. Don't take this personally!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You should not turn aside the belief that Lord Zain has in you...that we all have in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm going to stop you here. Please don't hate me for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Agh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm sorry... This is entity Ill Atmosphere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Agh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...let's end it now. If you apologize, everyone will forgive you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...?! ...Gaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ug-ugff...! He-he's so fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Don't...get...in...my...way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>N-no...Captain Kudan! Th-that's too much...! Ugff!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Is Zain up ahead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Gggh...! Argh...seriously?! That aura...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The Holy Guard's coat of arms was found at Chihaya's assassination scene. How could that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>At the very least...this means that there's a liar within the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No way...?! Are you trying to say that Chihaya was killed by the Holy Guard?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Perhaps it was the woman right next to you who was behind it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You scum! Are you gonna try to blame my mistress?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No...you're right...I...killed her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>So it was you after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>When I heard that she had been assassinated, I knew in my heart...I had been the one who had killed her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>If I had not let her go back to Wadatsumi then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>When I parted ways with Chihaya...I should have pulled her arm and kept her with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>She was right there next to me! I was in a position to protect her from the tragedy that befell her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Mistress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I cannot deny your words. I am responsible as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I just stood by and let her die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>No! You shouldn't hold yourself responsible, mistress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You're just like Kudanstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You're also being played like a puppet...without even knowing the real truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Reimei! Ack! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Played...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Mistress?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I don't know the real truth?</td>
