<td>Enough, Logi. No matter how many times we do this, the result will be the same.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why?! Why do you want even more power...when you're already this strong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What?</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>There's no need for you to use that cursed power of darkness!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>How do you know about that?!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why, Dias?</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...!</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Why do you always have to sacrifice yourself?! Why do you have to do everything on your own?!</td>

<td>What are you doing?! We won't be able to catch up with the Blue Flame Guard at this rate!</td>

<td>All I do, I do to change this sorrow-filled world.</td>

<td>Then, we can do it together.</td>

<tr>

<td>Logi, I'll tell you this one more time; your way of doing things won't change this world.</td>

<td>Dias, wait!</td>

<td>I won't. Our goal isn't to defeat them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's to gain an audience with King Patrick and establish a peace treaty. Isn't that what we've been fighting for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We've done plenty to slow them down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We've earned Zeke and the others enough time that it's unlikely they'll be able to catch up with them. Well done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You're right. We probably managed to help my dad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But, I want to stop Dias! I want to save my irreplaceable brother from going down the wrong road!</td>
