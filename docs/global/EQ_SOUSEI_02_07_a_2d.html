<td>Those who had partaken in lust became insects. In the end, it meant that everyone did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That was the curse that the Cursed Beast inflicted upon this region. The new reality that it had shaped for us, which became our inescapable truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why have I been spared? I was only a child when the curse was cast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Just a child, who knew nothing of love or lust; who barely knew anything about anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Of course, I was not the only one. However, as we grew older, the remaining children became insects, one by one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>They were useless, apathetic people who did not share my goals to save this world. In the end, they all turned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Only myself and my...special apprentices remained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I do not know love. I do not even understand what that word means. How is it different from lust? I know only that it is useless to my research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>However...there are things I do understand. These feelings deeply-rooted in my being that I cannot contain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hate. Fury. Despair. I will never forgive. I will never forget. My hometown, my childhood, all that was taken from me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That gentle place in my memories, its tree-lined streets, the leaves rustling in the wind...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The laughter of the people around me, the joy in their faces that I didn't understand... All of it, frozen in time, lost to both present and future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Even now I cannot accept it. That is why it must fall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast will fall by my hand. The creature that stole everything from me... I will rob it of everything, including its very life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Why do I despise the Cursed Beast so much? To be honest, I barely understand that hatred myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Or...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Perhaps...it is because I loved the people of this region, who will never be returned to me as they were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Grooooooooooaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That light...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Magic? The beast's shell is damaged!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Was that...Ambrosia's...? What?! But I thought the rod hadn't been completed yet?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huh? What're you on about, Nyx?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That light is from the magic rod Libra, which Ambrosia created to destroy Asmodeus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But...it hasn't been charged enough yet! We haven't finished our preparations! It doesn't have the power to take down the Cursed Beast right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Wait, so you're saying that it can't defeat the Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Nyx!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Mira! What's going on?! Why is Ambrosia using Libra?! What is she doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I don't know! I have no idea what's happening either! All I know is that we need to get you lot out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Come on, Nyx! Give me your hand! I can't take this many back on my own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Got it! Here we go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Tsk... This amount of power isn't enough to overcome the beast's healing ability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>After all that time and effort put into trying to stockpile enough energy to damage you... Well, at least I'll be able to help the young ones escape with—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What the⁠—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hey, Ambrosia...what's the point of this? Why don't you just give it up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yeah, Ambrosia. Really... Why even bother? All this hatred, anger, and whatever else... Where has it ever gotten you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Mira? Nyx? No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Asmodeus, you fiend... You must have made use of the same Space-Time Manipulation technique after seeing them in that ship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The future has an unlimited number of possibilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You filtered through all of them with Space-Time Manipulation and found one in which my apprentices had fallen to the corruption, then dragged them here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Leave the magic rod, Ambrosia. Forget this pointless revenge...and just rest with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You don't have to carry so much responsibility all on your own. Is this world really worth saving? If you think about it, it really isn't, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You want Libra?! Don't think I'll make it easy for you to take it from me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(Still...this isn't looking good.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(Most of my magil is being poured into Libra.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(I really have no idea how long I can keep this up...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well, I suppose I have no choice but to make this work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Why? Why work so hard, even though it may all come to nothing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No matter how far you might have fallen, Space-Time Manipulation is subject to the same rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You're on my turf now. I don't believe you can connect to the magil here as easily as you would like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>This is really becoming a hassle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Still...can you handle this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Oh no! I—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Gnrgh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Heh. Perfectly executed, if I do say so myself. I suppose the us from this timeline haven't quite gotten the hang of magic yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>This shouldn't...be possible. Your magil should have been altered in order for you to use Space-Time Manipulation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You shouldn't be able to use magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>How to explain this? I suppose you could say that we're...hybrids. There are an infinite number of timelines, and we're the sum of various parts taken from several different possible versions of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Which means our pasts are just as uncertain as our futures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>We two who the witch never took in as disciples, who were left to our own fates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We two who were never loved by the witch who might have cared for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>We two who never learned of her hatred, never sought to carry on the legacy of revenge she carried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>We two who have always wanted an opportunity to do this. The opportunity to kill the witch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Asmodeus... How dare you drag my apprentices into something like this! How could you do this to them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>This has been fun, witch. What was your name again? Oh, yeah. Goodbye, Ambrosia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The light is...fading?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>And the magic attacks from the witch's house have ceased...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Nimul, you don't think...? It can't be...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>We're back! Ambrosia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Ambrosia, tell us what's⁠—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Ugh, I'm gonna hurl. This method of travel is seriously no good for my stomach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Adaleigh. Ready your weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Huh? What're you talking about, old dog?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>The enemy is here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huh? Uh...Mira? Nyx? What're you...? Grandmother?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Is everyone all right? Wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Ambrosia...? Wh-what happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You're the ones from earlier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Whoops. You're back already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Guess there's nothing for it. Given the chance, I would've preferred to take some of you out before it came to this, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Asmodeus was getting impatient. You'd think a Cursed Beast wouldn't be such an incompetent boss, but appearances can be deceiving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I see the Beast's point, though. It's not like we could just leave this magic rod alone. Something had to be done about it, sooner rather than later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>No! Anything but that, you can't—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Give it back, or else. You can't just start taking Ambrosia's stuff!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Well, well. Figured it'd come to this, but it's still a pain in the butt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Go ahead. Try and take it back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Emmel, the witch needs healing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Everyone else, if you would lend me your aid... We must help Mira and Nyx defeat those Fallen!</td>
</tr>
