</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This doesn't concern you.</td>

<td>The hell it doesn't!</td>

<td>I can do with her as I please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Why…Why are you doing this to your sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…Put her down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hmph…It's taking some getting used to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It doesn't matter--your fate is sealed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I should, at least, give you my thanks. You did a fine job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>…That swordsmanship…those mannerisms… You're not Tamba, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Allow me to offer these parting words before you die: I am the one who controls the king's vessel. You may call me--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The Demon King.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Demon King...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Tamba was much too kind to become king. Although he was a vessel, he did not possess the attributes of a king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>…What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Betrayed by the one he trusted... You see, despair is the key to unlocking a demon's true potential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>A mixedblood that has abandoned human emotions and is prepared to be a demon--That is what one needs to be king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Now I see why your swordsmanship is different. You've taken over Tamba's body in some twisted scheme.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>…You've got some nerve--toying with Tamba like some plaything…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Isn't that right? Discarnate Power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmph…So you saw through my little ruse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What happened... What did you do to Tamba!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It is as you said--I took over his body. Where his consciousness went is anybody's guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We have no need for a feckless ruler. It is I who shall reign over all of Wadatsumi…using this body as my vessel…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You're despicable--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You are the one who drove Tamba into despair--ushering in the birth of the king... For that, I thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>With everything going off without a hitch, I couldn't afford to miss my golden opportunity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>…………</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>!!!!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>………… !!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The moment of awakening... That was my only chance. For a brief moment, Tamba lost consciousness, and the "vessel" was empty… That's when I snuck in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...It was nothing more than a gamble…but it payed off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You'll pay for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It was you who sowed the seeds of his despair. Have you already forgotten your role as a Demon Hunter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...! How could you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That's not your concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I can see you hesitating... Hmm. So, you put chakra in the food… How quaint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What would you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'll get Tamba back. And I'll put a stop to your scheme! Mark my words!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Demons and humans were finally starting to come together. I'm not going to let you hold us back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The peace we made was a lie. Everything was orchestrated for this moment. We used you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I don't give a damn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I not going to allow you to diminish our accomplishments... I swore to both Tamba and Kaede.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>This peace is not a lie! I will defeat you and get Tamba back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Tamba…? Koga...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>…Kaede...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>…Imagine that. You're still alive…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…! Ko…ga…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>……………</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>…Foolish humans. You baffle me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>…Shut...up…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>…What…is this…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>…What's going on! Ahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>…Kae...dae...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…! Koga...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>…Koga…why...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>…Heh... I promised Tamba...I'd take care of you…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>…I wish could've protected your brother, too…but I didn't have the strength. I'm sorry…Kaede.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What are you saying--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...! Is that not…my brother…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>…This presence...no way…the Discarnate Power...! Why…why are you doing this!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Everything is as I planned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>…I don't believe it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>…Don't cry, Kaede.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...I'm not crying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>This is no time to rest your eyes. Everyone is waiting to try your food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...Heh... You're right... Kaede...where are you? ...Are you there...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I'm right here…! Stay strong, Koga... ! You can't leave me! I won't forgive you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ah…it's no use… I don't have the strength to pick up a knife...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>…! Koga..! You can't be selfish...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Be the crazy fool that I know--with your lofty ideals--reach for the stars!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Don't say it's no use! Don't give up, you crazy fool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...You know me…I'm as crazy as they come. Ah... I wanted you to taste my food, one more time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>No! This is when you're supposed to say…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>"Eat first, then the we'll talk." Right!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I haven't told you that magic word. So…don't leave me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...I'm sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Stop apologizing! You're making it sound like… Like--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>…Don't get so worked up… I can't have you rampage before I…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>…! Dummy… You foolish, foolish man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>…It's alright. Even if I die…it's not the end…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>…Our lives…will always be connected…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>…Koga…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>…Thanks for everything, Kaede.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Koga…Koga!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>He's gone… Humans are such fragile creatures, aren't they? Now then…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>…!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>We can't allow a good meal to go to waste. That wouldn't do. What do humans say at a time like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>…Ah, yes…"Let us give thanks for this meal!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>!!!---!!!!!!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>There's no use fighting it. You, too, will die soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>…I won't forgive you… You killed him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>…Why are you so upset? He's just a lump of flesh now. What could be more joyous than to be someone's nourishment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Don't tell me you're going to let the death of your companion go to waste?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>…Go to waste?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Precisely. Humans are always blathering about the circle of life, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>…What would you know about life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>The beauty of life is that we are all connected through our time on this earth. Koga taught me that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I pity you! You will never understand the magnitude of that lesson!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>….</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>…! Urf... Ugh…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>…What are you--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>…Blechhhh… Urffff!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>...I give thanks for this meal...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>…………Urp………………</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>…Urr…Ur…Uhrr…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>You ate…a human...!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>…Urr…Urrrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>…If it ever looks like I'm about to die, will you devour me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>But...eating connects lives. If I die without achieving anything ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I want to be connected to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>…Why…did you kill him... Why…did you take him away from me... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I just wanted to live a normal life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Koga's life… His spirit... I will carry it with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>…Thank you for the meal…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>…Is this...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Ah… Koga…you may have been a fool...but I was the biggest fool of all…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Because...I just realized…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I took for granted your cooking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I took for granted your face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I took for granted our time together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Now that it's all gone, I finally realized. I was...happy!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Now that it's too late…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I realized everything you cooked for me was…delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>I'm sorry I never told you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>But…I won't let it end like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>You think you can defeat me? You, who have abandoned your race... You stand no chance against me in this form…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>It doesn't matter…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Can't you see that it's futile?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>…It's not futile. I will avenge Koga's death by defeating you…and return my brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>And…I will ensure peace! That is what I must do--for Koga's sake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>...I see. You've regained your demon strength by devouring him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>However, it is not enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>It's time for you to die. I have no use for you now that you're no longer a demon. In my kingdom--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>There is no place for your kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>…Human or demon…it doesn't matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Koga fought to create a society where nobody had to steal to survive. That was his vision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>One cannot live without taking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>…You stole my brother's body, you stole Koga from me… What more do you want!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>This country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>I won't let you take anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>…Here it comes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>What--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>I don't have to be me... if I can protect the future that Koga dreamed of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>I don't care if I'm someone else…as long as my brother comes back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>What…is this power!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>My brother was in despair…because he risked believing... I want to make him believe again--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>That humans are worthy of his trust!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Ridiculous...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>And, yes…that it's okay to dream big.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Koga taught me that...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>…!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>I told you--no more… I won't let you take any...more…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>...? She fell asleep... No, this is…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>…*Growl*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>*Roar*</td>

<tr>
