<td>Heh! Not bad! I guess I can go all out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Well, if they're going to be so clingy, it's rude to leave so soon. I'll tear you all to shreds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>They still have strength to spare?! If this keeps up...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What are you getting faint-hearted for? You don't mind if Carla gets taken away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I will never allow that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is where we make our stand! Get behind me! Huzzaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Carla! Don't over-do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm fine! I've always wanted to do my part to keep this desert safe, but all this time, I was the one being protected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It brings tears to my eyes! That's why I still have so much to give back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Carla!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Remember when Hawk said I'd be able to control this power when I have something to protect? Now is that time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You're after me, right?! Then I'll take you on! Come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So, this is Spiritbonding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Aw, man. I can't slack off when she's pulling out all the stops like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes... It is a shame. You might even break a sweat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Lucian, Retzius, your mission is not yet complete, understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Leave it to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ramses, you're not out of commission, are you? We must show them that we nobility are not to be trifled with, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Absolutely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Carla, we won't let you fight alone! I will protect you, no matter what! For Hawk's sake as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We will protect this desert together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Thank you, all of you! Let's protect our home! Hm? What's that sound?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's the Sand Hawks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I see our own guild members, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Even some members of the nobility... What is going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Captain! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>All of you... Why are you here? How?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Nefertiti! We will not let you fight alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh my, you're all here. I am...overcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ryle, we've gathered as many members as we can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Is this your doing, Ankh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I only informed each party of the situation. To be honest, I've never really trusted anybody in this desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I never expected anybody to take action even after hearing about what is going on. However, there was one man who believed in everyone here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Back then, I only moved to involve a handful of people, due to my own lack of willingness to trust in others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This time, it's different. I called upon as many people as I could reach, and now that leap of faith has been validated on all accounts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ankh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I do not know if this is enough to pay off the debt I owe Hawk, but there is one thing I am sure of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Just like him, everybody here believes in what this desert can be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It'd be a shame to call ourselves the Sand Hawks if we can't even fight off this menace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Someone take care of Ryle's wounds! The rest of you, prepare to counter the enemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Protect Nefertiti! Don't let them lay a single finger on her! The well-being of this desert is our responsibility!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Balt! This is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yeah... This is what a united desert looks like!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Bring it on! I'll take you all down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The fun's over. Neun, it's time to go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wait, what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Sol is calling for us. Orion contacted him. We're leaving this forsaken desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Tch! Things were just getting good. Hey! Looks like you all get to live another day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Next time we meet, I'll kill you. If you even manage to stay alive until then, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Whew. Is it over?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Balt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Yeah... We won.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I wish Hawk was here to see this, gosh darnit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm sure he's up there, watching over us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yeah, you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>No sprouts yet, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Well, we just have to be patient. It'll happen when it happens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>How are things on your end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Nefertiti is the same as ever. I have no idea what she's plotting or thinking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Oh, and Ramses started doing some bureaucratic work. He's still terrified of Nefertiti though, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Nefertiti said the nobility are working hard to push through plans needed to bring green life back to the desert, regardless of what the Conservatives say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>They're going to be part of the reform to make the desert a place where everybody can make a living!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What about you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Oh yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The Desert Wings have officially hired the Sand Hawks for security detail. Ryle wasn't there for any of the meetings, but Ankh and I hashed things out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Some tasks will go to those two mercenaries, Lucian and Retzius, but most of the jobs will be ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Oh, actually Ryle did come over to have a word before I left their headquarters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What did he say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>"Has anything sprouted yet? What's taking so long?" Heh. A bit unreasonable, isn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>He even added, "We're all gonna need the crops to keep up our way of life. We're counting on you."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Never would have thought he'd say something like that. I guess he's changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>(We'll keep this place safe for you. It was meant to be somewhere you could call home.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>(We'll turn this place into a lush oasis. I'll treat you to some bean soup then, all right?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Change is happening. People are starting to think of the future as more than what's right in front of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Man, I have so much to tell Hawk. It's amazing to see the seeds he sowed begin to sprout.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>"You'll never know unless you try." Such beautiful words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It may not seem like it, but surely and steadily, things are changing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I'll make this desert a place people can be proud to call home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>As this desert's symbol of hope, I'll make your dreams a reality, Hawk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Yeah, I can now believe without hesitation, the same way you did all those years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I hope you're watching, Hawk! We'll make this desert rich with life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Wow, hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Look! It's sprouting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Well, would you look at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Haha... Hahahahahaha! Gosh darnit, Hawk, we did it!</td>
