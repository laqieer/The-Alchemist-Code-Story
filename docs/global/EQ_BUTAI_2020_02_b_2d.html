<td>Kaya, please! Your strength could save—!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You are so thick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wh-why are you so angry with me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You're so dense... Though perhaps that's necessary when you're Lord Commander, and trying to take care of the entire world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What's that supposed to mean? I'm not blind to the world around me! I'm entirely capable of being sensitive, and caring, and—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But isn't this world incredibly wide? Are the depths of its history not endless? You can't see everything. Only a fool would think otherwise.</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This is why I quit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Is that all you have to say about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Without saying a word...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Sometimes there are words we'd rather leave unsaid. Surely you can appreciate that.</td>

<td>Zain? What's wrong?</td>

<tr>

<td>How...?</td>

<td>Zain?</td>

<td>But you're...!</td>

<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Stop! Zain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I have to go!</td>

<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What did you see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I just need to check and make sure. That's all—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Stop it. You mustn't go that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>K-Kaya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why not? I know this road. It leads to the underground slums, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You don't need to know what's down there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I only managed to find the barest mentions of the place when I was digging into the history of Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The sunken city where light does not reach. The underground world that's not recorded on any map.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Inhabited only by orphans of war and criminals who can no longer show their faces on the surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>A place for vagrants with nothing left to lose. A last resort, where those who are already as good as dead wind up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>A place for all the world's "expendables".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I pick up my share of undesirable pursuers every time I set foot in that place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>So that's why you asked me to escort you during that mission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Don't you find it strange that this is the first you're hearing of this place? You, a Lord Commander?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Take some time to think on that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But Kaya... This is all the more reason for—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Are you just going to pretend you never saw it? Like everyone else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Zain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I will illuminate every inch of this world, Kaya. This isn't just the Holy Guard's stance—it's mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You're only fooling yourself with lies like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Where did you go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Where are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You lost, old man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Those are some pretty fancy digs you've got on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'm... looking for someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Oh, yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>A... woman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Old flame of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>In a slum like this? You looking for her, or chasing her down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Saving her, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Heh. So you're the decent kind, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I-I suppose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>No need to get all bashful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>No need to compliment me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Look, I actually know this area pretty well. How 'bout I help you out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You'd do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It's no trouble. I was just on my way home from work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>How 'bout we swing past my place for a bit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>He left... I shouldn't have let him go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Why can't he be honest with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Oh, dear. Trouble in paradise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Are you in good health?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>This... doesn't bode well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I have to say, I really enjoyed the trip here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Hello, Most Reverend Bishop Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You know, I think I'm starting to understand where your flights of fancy come from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Should you really be exposing your fair countenance to the harsh rays of the sun? What if a commoner were to lay eyes upon you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>There's no need for that silly rule in here. No need for pretenses, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'm here to make... an earnest request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>A request? Then you came all the way out here to convince me to return? I suppose you felt the Lord Commander wasn't up to the task.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Our Lord Commander is a gentle man. His kindness is part of his charm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>It certainly is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I'd like you to curb your archaeological and historical investigations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Would you, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Come, it's for your own good. Didn't you yourself mention that you've been attacked on multiple occasions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>It is my wish that the Holy Guard should stand as one. If you persist in this foolishness, we could lose you. Just think—Zain would be devastated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I do get attacked every time I get too close to the slums. Those hooded figures—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Residents of Lost Blue, I'm sure. They don't seem the sort to take kindly to someone prying into their business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Now, now. You wouldn't turn your back on me without giving me the courtesy of an answer, surely?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Upon reflection, I thought it best I extricate our Lord Commander from Lost Blue as quickly as possible. I should make haste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ahh... I see. I shall leave this matter in your capable hands, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Actually, Most Reverend Bishop Waginau... I have a request to make of you in turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Let's hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Please disregard my resignation letter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>The usual, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>My apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Not to worry. I am only too happy to oblige.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Hmhm. I couldn't disappoint such a pretty face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Whatever beauty I may have pales in comparison to yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Oh, please. There's no need to be so humble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Oh, please. There's no need to flatter me so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I wasn't—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Is this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Welcome to the world's cesspool, my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Terra: Lost Blue (Memories)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>So, who did you say you were looking for, again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Ey, Yuvan! Is that guy your mark for today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Ugh! You reek. Get out of my face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Yuvan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>That's me. Pretty cool name, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Heh heh heh. C'mon, Yuvan! Let us have him already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>So this was a setup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>You only have yourself to blame. This was obviously a trap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Don't keep me waitin'! I haven't eaten anythin' in days! I'll take whatever I can get.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Check out his fancy digs! These'll sell good. Nice one, Yuvan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>W-wait! I'm not here to fight you! Can't we talk about this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>You can't win. Lay down your weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah. Settle down. It's not like I wanted to fight you, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>These guys are the real catch today. Let's see what they've got...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>W-wait... You used me as bait?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>It was just too good of an opportunity to pass up—you stick out like a sore thumb down here. So when idiots like these inevitably come and attack you, even if I help out, it's just self-defense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>You're not feeling bad for them, are you? Man, you really are dense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>They're not worth your pity, you know. Not this lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>They steal whatever they can get their hands on, they eat filth off the streets, and they kill without a second thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Then I should convey my gratitude. I'm—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Don't mention it. And no need to introduce yourself—I don't care who you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>You look cool. That's enough for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>R-right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>So how are you planning on rescuing that damsel of yours, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>If I find her... I'm going to take her away from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Heh. You sayin' this place isn't good enough for your girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Oh, no, I... Sorry. I didn't mean to imply that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Listen... I don't know what the deal is between the two of you, but if your girlfriend is down here, she's already saved, isn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>What? Excuse me, but you literally just called this place a cesspool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Sure did. This is a place where the sun doesn't shine. Not many people would choose to come to this godforsaken place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>But those who do are here because they can't live anywhere else. This is the only place they can thrive. You feel me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>For people like that, this place is its own sort of salvation. You can steal, and wallow in the mud... Even if you carry some terrible sins and secrets that should never see the light of day, so what? Light don't shine down here anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Nobody's gonna track you down here. Nobody's going to come after you. That alone is a pretty big relief for some of the people here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Some people... just want to be left alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Pretty much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>What about you, Yuvan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Who, me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Yes. What makes you so different from them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Do you not wish to be saved?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Saved? Hah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>I want to save all those I possibly can. And I won't give up until I've illuminated every corner of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Hah! That's cute. Maybe I ought to call you the Rising Sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Are you trying to be funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Funny? Hmph. You're the one who's funny. Are you going to try and save those cretins who were ready to tear you limb from limb? Are you going to try and shed light on this stinking cesspool? You can try... But it's not gonna work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>I want to at least see where my words can take me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>You sure like your words, huh? Heh. I like your spirit, old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Is that what drew you to him, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Who're you talk—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Come on. No point hiding anymore. Come out where we can see you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>No need to be shy. You're his old flame, right? That's why you've been following us. Watching us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I thought I would finally get to hear your voice again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>I-I can't believe it! I... I don't even know what to say! Haha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>I have so many questions. Why are you here? What have you been doing all this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Talk to me, please... I just want to hear your voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>But you merely clutched at your throat...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>———!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>And when your lips did move, no sound escaped them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Not sure how far your words are going to get you with this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Is there something wrong with your voice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>The terrible scars on your throat had left you without a voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Wh-what happened to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>"This is a place for the people the world has discarded—myself included. There is no salvation for us."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>"Trying to save me after I've been neglected for so long is a kindness I could do without."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Those aren't her words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>How would you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>If words are so important to you, then it only makes sense for you to discard someone like her, who can't talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>No! I wouldn't—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Sorry. Are my words getting a little too harsh for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Wh-what's gotten into you all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Oh, nothing... I just really hate guys like you, who wave around this illusion of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Come on, Zain. Let's go home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Well, well. Your friend's dressed real fancy too. There some kinda VIP tour of the slums going on that I haven't heard about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>If I'm a VIP, I don't need to respond to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Heh. Touche.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Come on, Zain. We need to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>———?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>I won't abandon you here. And I will illuminate this place, if it's the last thing I do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Heh. Funny thing to say when you're wearing a dark expression like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>You chivalrous fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>That's me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>I really am an idiot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Love got you down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Why...? Why am I such a fool?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>It is love though, right?</td>

<td>Northern Pride: Headquarters of the Holy Guard (Memories)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>Othima, how would you give a voice to someone who cannot speak?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Uhh... You're going to have to give me more to go on than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>There's someone I want to save through the power of words, but I don't know how to go about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>And this person can't talk? Is that the only obstacle here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>I keep trying to think of a way to make it work, but I'm coming up empty. I'm such a useless fool...</td>

<td>You really are, if you can't see the simple solution right in front of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>Wh-what do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Just write letters. Duh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Letters! Why didn't I think of that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>Love letters, eh? Pretty romantic stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>I-it's not like th—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>And by romantic, I mean boring. How old-fashioned can you get?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>I-I'm not writing love letters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>Sure you're not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>I'd rather die than have to express something like that in written form!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Now you're just exaggerating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>Hello, you two. Just popped in to say good bye. I'm heading out for a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>Well, well. If it isn't Little Miss I'm-Not-Quitting-After-All. Where are you off to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>Tease me if you like, but I got a fifty percent increase in my salary when I returned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>Are you serious?! I guess Waginau really did mean business when he went off to personally retrieve you, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>Why don't you try handing in your resignation too? Who knows—it might pay off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>I doubt it. I think it's a little early in my career for me to be pulling a stunt like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>Besides, it looks like our boss just hit puberty. Gotta help him through that first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>Haha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>Speaking of which... Any idea what to do about Lord Zain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>He's just a little overexcited. May I suggest a bucket of cold water to bring him back to his senses?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>Will do. Love is in the air...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>Kaya... Where are you headed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>I'm going to investigate the Slothstein ruins again.</td>
</tr>

<td>Don't worry, I'm not leaving anyone in the lurch. I've finished up my work—and I'm not going to turn away from a raise like that.</td>
</tr>

<td>I see... Hold on a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>242</td>
<td>Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>243</td>
<td>Oh? A letter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>244</td>
<td>Would you deliver it to Lost Blue for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>245</td>
<td>I... What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>246</td>
<td>I'm giving Othima's strategy a try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>His... strategy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>248</td>
<td>Yes! I'm going to use letters to communicate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>249</td>
<td>Letters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>250</td>
<td>They're the best way to converse with someone who can't talk. I could've kicked myself for not thinking of it earlier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>251</td>
<td>What...? Oh... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>252</td>
<td>I-it was Othima's idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>So... you want me to deliver a love letter for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>254</td>
<td>I-it's not a love letter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>255</td>
<td>Of course not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Right. Sure. Why not?</td>

<td>Kaya, please... This is the best a fool like me can hope for.</td>

<td>It's true. You really are a blockhead.</td>
</tr>

<td>260</td>
<td>You didn't even write an address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>261</td>
<td>Dang... That's almost medieval!</td>
