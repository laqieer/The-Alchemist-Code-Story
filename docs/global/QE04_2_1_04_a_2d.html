<td>I, Mocca of the Neva tribe, have returned. Is Fuu here?</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>... ...</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Where is Fuu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I know you can hear me. What rudeness prompts you to ignore my question?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmph. We have no words to spare for one who holds discourse with other factions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Exactly! Why would we let someone like you meet with Fuu! Don't make me laugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Right now, all of Saga is...ack! Aghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hey... He's brought the blight with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We, the faction of Fuu, are warriors! How dare you soil our name with your blight! You should be ashamed of yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Don't come near us. You'll spread your blight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hmph! Haa! Hoo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Fuu! It is I, Mocca from the Neva tribe. So, you are here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Mocca, is it? Have you concluded your investigation into the massive outbreak of the Jam?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Regarding my investigation, I still have not reached a definite conclusion yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>However, I've come to issue a report regarding valuable information that I've obtained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The Gluttony army is behind the massive outbreak of the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The Gluttony army... Hmph. If only the cursed Tehre faction hadn't engaged in trade with Gluttony this could've all been prevented.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Voda must have her hands full with the Jam wreaking havoc in her forests. If only they'd keep their problems to themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Fuu...perhaps that's a somewhat selfish take on the situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I merely speak the truth. You've performed well. Now, stand down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Although we may belong to a different faction, we all live in the same land of Saga. Does this situation not concern you in the least?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I said stand down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Fuu...will you say the same if or when such an outbreak occurs at Lilith's Hill?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hyahahahahahah! Don't worry. If or when such an outbreak occurs, I'll take care it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Fuu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Do not underestimate the power of the Sprite Trio. We of the Fuu will protect the land of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There is one who's foreseen the destruction of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Saga will not be destroyed. I will not allow it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>She also foresaw Voda's death at the hands of General Georgios of the Gluttony army!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Fuu, I'm sure that even you have noticed something is going on! There's a crisis that threatens to destroy all of Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...We've got to hurry.</td>
