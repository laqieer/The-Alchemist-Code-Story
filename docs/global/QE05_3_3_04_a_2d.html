<td>Sir Dias! We have no intention of fighting with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Then answer me. What is your objective? Why have you come here? What exactly do you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You really think that we would tell you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You have a point. I know that no amount of coercion could force you to sell out your comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That is simply the kind of knights you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>However, you would be surprised to know that it only takes a slight shift in scenario for people to change. Let us take that woman over there, for example.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If you do not tell me where Logi is, her life is forfeit. What would you do if I said that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Y-you...! What are you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Resistance is futile. You do not have the capacity to take me on, to face the Captain of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Come, give me the information I seek. So long as you do that, no one will need to be harmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You're soft.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Urrggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That is not how Corpse operates, Dias Elysion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We only need let one would-be-informant live. There is no reason to spare the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You...! Why are you here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Waginau has given the order to silence all who would interfere with our original mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Our...original mission? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It is not something that you need to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ngh! We are under attack! Protect the perimeter! We are in the middle of a city! We must do what we can to keep damage to a minimum!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Lady Marie, over here! You should be a little safer inside the guild!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Th-thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Aaaarrrrggghhh! N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Those who are injured should retreat immediately! Evacuation will be carried out by reinforcements!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>They're using Alchemy in the dang city! It's like they don't care about destroying the area at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Nnggh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What are you doing, Dias Elysion? Surely you do not intend to turn your back on the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That would be such a waste. Oh, yes. A waste of all the blood that you have spilled up until this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Tch! I never intended to join your ranks. Stay the hell out of my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Urrggghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Then this is where it ends, Elysion. Dying with your former comrades ought to be an honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hmph. It's been a while since I've been to the desert... I didn't realize there was a show on. What's all this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Geez, can't even take a holiday in peace anymore. This desert is the home away from home for my comrades. I'm not about to let you outsiders just do as you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huh?! Who the hell are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You're the Blue Tongues, right? How long are you gonna keep standing there with your tails between your legs? Get your butts back into formation and stop their attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If you don't, you'll lose everything. You won't be able to protect diddly-squat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>H-huh?! Yes, um... Yes, sir! All right, team, let's bring it together! We're going to crush every last one of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Get into formation! The enemy may be strong, but we have the numbers! Let's overwhelm their few with our many!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hmph. Not bad. I guess I'll join in for once, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>G-Georgios...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Is that you, Marie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Are you all right? I heard that you had disappeared from Saga, and I thought...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You're such a worry wart, you know that? You really think I'd go dying so easily?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>N-no! Of course not! I... I'm happy to see you again, Georgios!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>All right, so... What're you gonna do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Are you going to fight me here? Or are you going to change sides? I don't really care which, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It doesn't look like that sword in your hand likes what they're doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hmph. You don't need to tell me that. I follow my own brand of justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Grrrrnnnnggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I have a goal of my own, and right now, you're standing in my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You're an interesting one, I'll give you that. I especially like how you don't understand your own duty. That really hits the spot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Now it's starting to look like you're the ones who are at a bit of a disadvantage, isn't it? What are you gonna do about that, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>There! That's the Gluttony Foss border!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What are we going to do? We can hardly declare ourselves a merchant caravan with these numbers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>We will just have to push through! I am counting on you!</td>
</tr>
