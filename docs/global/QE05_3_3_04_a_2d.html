<td>You really think that we would tell you?</td>

<td>You have a point. I know that no amount of coercion could force you to sell out your comrades.</td>

<td>Nnggh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse</td>
<td>What are you doing, Dias Elysion? Surely you do not intend to turn your back on the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>That would be such a waste. Oh, yes. A waste of all the blood that you have spilled up until this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Corpse</td>
<td>Then this is where it ends, Elysion. Dying with your former comrades ought to be an honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Hmph. It's been a while since I've been to the desert... I didn't realize there was a show on. What's all this?</td>
</tr>

<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/givol_prior.png" alt="Georgios" height="128"><br>Georgios</td>
<td>Geez, can't even take a holiday in peace anymore. This desert is the home away from home for my comrades. I'm not about to let you outsiders just do as you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blue Tongue Soldiers</td>
<td>Huh?! Who the hell are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/givol_prior.png" alt="Georgios" height="128"><br>Georgios</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/givol_prior.png" alt="Georgios" height="128"><br>Georgios</td>
