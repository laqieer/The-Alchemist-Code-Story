<td>001</td>
<td>They are here, my Lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Excellent. The rest of you are dismissed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Welcome, welcome. Had I known I'd have such prestigious visitors, I would have prepared for your arrival in a more acceptable way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ah, but where are my manners. We have not introduced ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I am Zheng Yi, lord of a noble house of Greed Dike. No doubt you may have already heard of my... interests, in this town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And this is Asuka, head of my house guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Greetings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Is it just me, or does Asuka look an awful lot like Shion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ugh. So that minx has a sister, and they're BOTH shady. I knew it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Roxanne is right. That night in Lustberg, I had already suspected our friendly "acquiantance".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>See, Sieg? You ARE dense! Teacher picked up on it, but you didn't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Okay, okay, I'm dense...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Now, now, you can save your little revelations for later. Let us talk business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>First, I must commend your efforts on following the trail this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We were careful, but of course, there are things we cannot possibly have complete control over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The laboratory ruins, the Constructs, and the Alchemia substances... Just what are you planning to achieve?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Exactly what your dear little speaker did in Sakris Village for a number of years prior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You mean... The Divine Protector... And the ritual?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The one and only. At the time it was the only Prototype of its kind to be found. It was a key piece of the puzzle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Such a shame that the raiders did a terrible job. I suppose you could say the Prototype brought its "divine judgment" upon them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't tell me... YOU were the one behind the raiders?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Mm, in a way, I suppose. Perhaps I should have engaged the services of more... disciplined help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I would have had far more peace of mind in their abilities to secure potential assets...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Your raiders injured many innocent villagers, and nearly burned down Sakris Village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Why? What have they done to deserve this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hey, Soren, snap out of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Your sins will not go unpunished.</td>
