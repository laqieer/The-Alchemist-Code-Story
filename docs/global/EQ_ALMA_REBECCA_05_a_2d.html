<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Ngh... There're so many...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You may be the eldest daughter of this family, but you're still inexperienced. The Summons of your Battalion are still too few and frail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You have no chance of winning. Just hand over Alma now! If you do, we won't speak of your treason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Haa...haa... Th-those guys are after me, so...don't push yourself, Rebecca. It's okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Let's just do what they say. I'll find a way to escape without your help, eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Y-you fool! Are you...? Are you telling me to abandon my friend?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Rebecca... Haha. Yeah, you really... You've always been the meddling type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You're always looking after someone. This time, you're trying to watch over the whole country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That meddling... Who is it for? For the sake of the Helkovara? For this lot?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>At first...it was for my family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Becoming class chairperson, watching over those studying around me... I thought it was all a given for a member of the Helkovara family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yet seeing how this group conducts themselves... It's clear to me now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Now I see that, just as they were in the past, my family is power mad. So even... Even if I become queen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Even if I, Rebecca Helkovara Lustburg, take the throne, I refuse to do so as a pawn for my family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I don't want to be a self-centered ruler who constantly belittles others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Isn't a queen who lives to serve others the ideal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Who do you think you are, spouting all that idealistic drivel?! You don't have what it takes to rule over people! Take a step out into the real world before you start mouthing off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Living to serve only others? Who ever said that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You used your incredible power to help another?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It may have been for myself as well. After all, I wouldn't want someone I love to become an insect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I've come this far to do this for myself and with the hope that I am helping others as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I want to do this for myself as much as for anyone else! I want to make this country better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>However, I can fight on, knowing that it will benefit others, too! Like Queen Venus, Melvy...and just like Liz!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What do you think you can do with what little power you have left, big mouth? Don't make me laugh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You said it yourself, if I'm not mistaken; that if you cast Alma's magic on Battalion, they'll become an unstoppable force!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Gah! There's no way! She can do that even in this condition?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Let's go, Alma!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>S-seriously?! After training with Melvy, and the fight against this lot before that, I've got no magical power left, you know?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh no... Wh-what about physical strength?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You're kidding, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hmph. You two are as oblivious as ever. If you need magical power, there's some right here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm filled with Lisbeth's power right now. Honestly, it's a pretty gross feeling, so just hurry up and use it. I can't stand it much longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Is that really okay? I mean, you finally have magical power in you now. It's your one chance to be able to defeat a witch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm not about to fight with borrowed power. I said it, didn't I? I'm fighting to have our existence recognized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What kind of idiot would proudly show off his hand-me-downs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But...what if taking that energy kills you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Like I'm going to die that easily! Well... I can't say I'd have no regrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I mean, I know this isn't a power I got for myself, and it's not something I feel I can use, but if I stayed like this, I would have a lot more job opportunities...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Job opportunities...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The way us men earn money to survive is by making incantation gear and selling it to foreign countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>In particular, there's a curious merchant from Saga who always comes to buy things. For those of us who can't use magic, incantation items give us a way to surpass witches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It's only science if it's carried out in the pursuit of that which is not inherent to me. I can't make good incantation goods when I'm bursting with this magic power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Besides, people will always take a mile if you give them an inch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Y-you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The more I use Alchemy...the more I realize how powerful it is. It scares me, yet makes me feel like I'm capable of doing anything with this power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Gradually...I've begun to feel the weakness of my body as a nuisance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(That's right! This culture of female dominance is something that Alma's grandmother established all on her own.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(To the other witches, it must have been such a sudden gift.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(If you give people an inch, they'll take a mile.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(If people are just given things, then they'll grow impudent and the situation will dissolve into fighting.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(But...how do we keep the balance, then?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Just hurry up and use it! I don't need pity from you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'll get stronger on my own and I'll surpass you witches!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I will get stronger on my own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Then, don't hesitate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Salomo's magic will flow that way, so aim it toward Battalion! Rebecca? Are you listening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, right... Yes! I understand! This brings back memories...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Memories of when Battalion were running wild before and Liz shared her power with me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Oh yeah, that happened, didn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>(At that time, I didn't really intend to borrow even more power from Liz.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(She's my rival, so I don't like being in debt to her.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>(From then on, I haven't been able to tear my eyes away from her.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>We have Liz, and because that girl can only see what is in front of her, we were able to reach our goal without getting lost along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>That's it. That's what Melvy and them were missing. Even now, Liz's power is supporting us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I can't become stronger on my own...so we have to all live and become stronger together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I felt stronger when I was on my own, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>That's right, everything you have was given to you by the Helkovara family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Now is the time to repay that debt! Do you not understand that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>No, not everything! I've had best friends beside me to support me, walk with me, and help me toward my goals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>One day, after she's grown up some more, she'll come back! So I will create a safe, warm country for her to come home to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>For that, we all need to get stronger together and support each other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Even if I'm not as independent as Queen Venus, I will become the ruler that she wasn't able to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>That is the Rebecca Helkovara Lustburg that I am to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You... Rebecca! Would you really cross your family...your mother...like that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>No. Someday, I will support you and the Helkovara as a whole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>S-support us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>That's right. I want us to see eye to eye and to support each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I want to become that kind of queen! So let me watch over you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Stupid rookie, prattling on and on... Fine. If you want to take care of us, then first I'll have you show me your true strength!</td>
</tr>
