<td>001</td>
<td>I'm so hungry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Starving... I must eat... Devour... Anything will do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Grrgggh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...The strength of my prey is my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm...hungry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...Huh? What is this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hngh... Why do I feel exhausted? It's like there's not a single magicule left in my body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh... Wait a minute! D-don't tell me that I died?! Again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Rest assured. You are not dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>My name is Ouroboros, the observer of destiny, and this place is known as the Door of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Uhm, Ms. Ouroboros? What business does the 'observer of destiny' have with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Our worlds crossed paths by chance, but I fear that means a calamity from your world has entered ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>A calamity from our world? No way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>They are beings possessed by a ferocious appetite. They are currently ravaging and devouring their way through the forests of Saga, and accumulating tremendous amounts of Alchemia in their bellies by doing so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>They will inflict serious damage to Saga if nothing is done to stop them. Not to mention, our worlds will grow more and more tangled in a way that could spell disaster for both of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's why I have also called forth some of your closest allies so that they may help you counter this calamity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>My closest allies? I don't see anyone else around, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Unfortunately, it appears that some interference caused by our worlds colliding sent them to different locations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(Hey, Great Sage? Is this girl telling the truth?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(She mentioned beings with a ferocious appetite... That's gotta be orcs then, right? But we already...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(...Huh? Great Sage? Hey, are you there?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(No way?! Uhm, h-hey?! Why can't I hear the Great Sage's voice anymore?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>At this rate they will soon march on and inflict great damage to a human settlement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(It's probably the orcs... I don't really get how this happened, but I can't let them make the same mistake again.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yeesh, I can't just ignore your plight after hearing about this mess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If there's something I can do to help, I will do my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That's all I can really say. I can't promise anything yet, not until you help me out a little first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You're asking me to go and prevent a calamity, but I don't know a thing about this place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hmm... Very well, then I shall grant you two guides. I know just the ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That'd be a huge help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(Wh-whew! No being tossed into the world completely unarmed and unprepared for me!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I just have one more question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Once I get the sources of this calamity to calm down, will I be able to take them back to my world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That will be impossible. They've already devoured and absorbed too much Alchemia from this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Taking them back with you would bode ill for your world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I vow to safely return you to your world once the calamity has been dealt with. Will you take accept this request?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Not like I got any another choice, right? Well, I'll see what I can do. I'm quite the expert at adapting to new worlds these days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Then I'll send you on your way. I leave it in your hands, otherworldly visitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?! E-eep! I'm f-falling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Phew, safe landing! Thanks! Uhm, miss, uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Albea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I was asked to guide you. It seems like we both got wrapped up in something rather troublesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You might have a point there, but I'm used to it. I've always been the type of guy who struggles with saying no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Besides, if those orcs are really on a rampage again then, well... I can't just ignore it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>A calamity-class monster that could shroud this world in chaos... Indeed, such a thing should not be ignored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'm Creto. I'll do whatever I can to help you protect the people of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I heard that an inhabitant from another world had come to help us, but your, uhm, shape...is a little different from what I was expecting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ah, yeah, I'm a slime. I got a human form too, but I'm not exactly in peak physical condition right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>A slime...? I don't know what that is supposed to be, but I hope you recover soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>We were called here to aid you, but it looks like we've got company to deal with first.</td>
</tr>
