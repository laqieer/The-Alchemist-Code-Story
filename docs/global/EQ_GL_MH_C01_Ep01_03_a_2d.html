<td>Chief! This is Siegfried, a traveller who has come to see our village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>On behalf of Sakris Village, I welcome you to our humble abodes and enjoy what simple hospitality we can offer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Thanks Chief. I'm amazed at what a bustling village you have here in the midst of this turbulent region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Bandits and raiders infest the surrounding region but the few trade caravans who ply this route often speak of your village as a sanctuary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ah, we welcome all who come in peace. We are as dependent on them for trade as they are on the shelter we provide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm not much of a trader and more of a curious traveller but I hope I can find a way to repay your village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Chief!!! Another group of hunters that were due home two nights ago have not come back yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'll lead the party to search for them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'll come with you as time is of the essence. The more help you get the better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Thank you for your help. Please bring them back safely!</td>
