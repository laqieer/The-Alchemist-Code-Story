<td>Long time no see, Orion. You, who see other humans as less than yourself, have come this far in achieving your ambitions...but it all ends here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Lord Zain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hello, Kanon. You have done very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>L-Lord Zain...</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Zain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You as well, Kudan. Without you, we could not have made it to this point. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wh-what are you saying?! That's not why I—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Despite having different approaches, the both of you have always held dear the idea that we must protect the future of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Without either of you, there is no way to protect the world from this powerful threat. I am grateful for all that you both have done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What are you saying?! Have you forgotten?! It was me wh-who...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If you are referring to having killed me, you may rest easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What happened was a result of my own failure to say what needed to be said. The circumstances created as a result of that led you to do what you did. The fault is not yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I am sorry that my own inaction has caused you so much suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I-I... I can't accept your words...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's too late for even you to make a difference.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Nimul's Alchemy of Power can be countered only with Emmel's Alchemy of Compassion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Without Emmel's Vessel of Reincarnation, what can stop the resurrection of Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Emmel's soul has not deserted us. The Alchemy of Power may have been allowed to run rampant until now, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It is our responsibility—our destiny as Holy Guard and supreme judge—to stop you from resurrecting Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Emmel's soul...still exists? No. You cannot distract me with such a pathetic lie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It is no distraction. The Vessel of Reincarnation may have been lost, but Emmel had a remarkably thorough contingency plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The founder of the Holy Guard was not just anyone. It was Emmel herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Emmel is also the one who taught the head of the Holy Guard, the Lord Commander, to be the supreme judge who watches over the balance between the Alchemy of Power and the Alchemy of Compassion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Why do you think she bothered to create such an institution?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>She created something in preparation for the possibility that her own Alchemy of Compassion would be out of commission when the Alchemy of Power needed to be reined in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Then, she entrusted that power to the supreme judge she had trained herself: The Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Then, that power is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes. It is the holy sword which you hold in your hand: Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>When the Alchemy of Compassion was lost from this world, all of the strength needed to face the Alchemy of Power was entrusted to Emmel's supreme judge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>All of the power and all of the compassion she held for the people of the future now lies in your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Then...the person who called you and the other Captains forth was...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yes... Kanon's prayer to Excalibur only provided the opportunity to fulfill Emmel's lingering prayers that Nimul would be stopped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Then...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Then...there's a chance that Excalibur can stop Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yes. At the very least, Excalibur gives us a fighting chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>A fighting chance? A false sense of security, more like. How helpful can Emmel's prayers be now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Especially against Nimul himself! What can your insignificant prayers do in the face of our power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You two, we must act quickly! The resurrection of Nimul's soul is accelerating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I know! I will do everything in my power to make sure that Emmel's prayers will reach Nimul! Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>If we cannot bring him down, humankind has no chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>This is no time to hold anything back! Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I told you... It's too late! I am only one step away from carving out a new path for humankind! One that no one has ever taken before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>With one step, I will blow open the doors for humankind to reach a new plane of existence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>O Nimul, your time has come! O Sacred Stones, guide the soul of the great alchemist to this body!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Urk! We couldn't stop it after coming this far?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Why...is nothing happening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>How can this be?! I did everything perfectly! I had everything prepared for Nimul's resurrection!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Why, Nimul?! Why do you forsake me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Could it be that Emmel is preventing the resurrection?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>From what I sensed, it seems more like Nimul himself rejected this man's plea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>We can't let this opportunity go to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I don't need any resurrection ceremony to show you who is more powerful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>No matter how hard you fight, your strength is no match for mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Here he comes!</td>
