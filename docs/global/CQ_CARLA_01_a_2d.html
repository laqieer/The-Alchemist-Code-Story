<td>Not a soul in sight... I was certain Hawk would be here…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What's this? Traces of water... So, he was here after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>*Sigh* Still wasting precious water on this seed. Who knows if it will grow…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It would probably get trampled if fighting ever broke out here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I always said he should focus on guild work instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But then he'd just tell me the desert has made me heartless or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Live in the desert long enough and you become impatient--your heart starts to dry up…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>For me, watering this seed is like praying to return some life to the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>He's an oddball, that's for sure, but I have a soft spot for his way of thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Still, this seed won't live to see tomorrow if it gets trampled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>*Pant* Almost…to town… Just a little farther!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hey you! Stop! Don't move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? W-What the--?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Not one more step! You're about to step on a very precious seed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A seed? Oh no! Uh… I--I'm going to fall over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ahhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Sorry about that. You're not hurt, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm fine! The sand broke my fall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>At least I didn't step on the seed. Phew. I had no idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah…a friend of mine has been trying to grow it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Not sure a desert is the best place for it, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Never know unless you try!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well, according to him, there's hope …</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Seems like he's investing in a brighter future for this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Imagine the desert full of greenery. It'd be like paradise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yeah…paradise. I bet it would be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(Too bad it's nothing more than a pipe dream)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(Those of us living here know. This is our reality. We don't have time for fantasies.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(The kid can praise Hawk if he wants, I guess.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>By the way, what's your name, kid?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh! I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Aruba!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Aruba! Nice meeting you. I'm Carla.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So, tell me--what are you doing alone in a place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well, I'm a merchant so I came to sell my goods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ah, that explains the bulky luggage. You're pretty strong for a pipsqueak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I may look small, but actually I'm…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Say, how about I accompany you to town?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>These parts are no place for a scrawny kid like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Besides, talking about my friend put me in a good mood. Shall we?</td>
