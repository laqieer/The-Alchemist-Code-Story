<td>Spiritbonding, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It is said to be a mystical power the Sephira were able to use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I've been told it was even able to heal the earth and cultivate life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Who told you this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well, uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm sorry, I've already said too much. For some reason, I felt safe opening up to you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Let me warn you: Looking for the Sephira is a waste of your time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What? Why is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The blessings of the great Tree of Life have been lost. The other Sephira have lost their ability to use Spiritbonding, just as your mother has.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>How did you...?! You must be...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Go back to your home, Hawk. Those who live here are little more than refugees who have lost their powers and seek a peaceful life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>W-wait, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ugh, ow... That guy was really tough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Why is it always like this?! No matter what, fortune favors the nobles over us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The Sephira! Don't they know that's just a myth?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Would you mind elaborating on that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wha—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>How long do you intend on following me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Until you accept my request! Please, lend me your—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>—No, wait. Teach me how to use Spiritbonding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Has your mother taught you nothing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>My mother did not tell me much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Only that if I do not have the mark, I should forget about my heritage... She said that right before she died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Your mother was wise. Listen, Hawk... Spiritbonding has already been lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Even if those of our bloodline have a natural aptitude for it, our sephirah, which was how we wielded our Spiritbonding, have all been lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>S-sephirah...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What you called a "mark" is the catalyst which enabled us to sense and control nature's Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>As a result, as I've been trying to tell you, we are now merely a nameless community that does not have the power to bring green life back to this desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But still you have your uses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Where did you come from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Finally, I've found a surviving member of the Sephira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If your people have forgotten how to use your inherited powers, then we shall make better use of them for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Mister Kamui! Leave this to me! Run—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, that took a lot longer than I thought. I was beginning to worry that none of you had noticed the bait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Now, I have a few questions I need to ask you. Are you willing to surrender without making trouble?</td>
