<td>I'm sorry… I lost consciousness after I fell off the cliff. As soon as I came to...I started making my way here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>…I see. Did any humans spot you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>…No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I wasn't able to protect you back there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's not your fault, Tamba. I...wasn't strong enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Don't worry about that. I promised you, didn't I? I'll never let anyone hurt you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…Never again.</td>

<td>We devour because we want to live. That's all… Then why--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Why were we captured by the humans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>My eyes happened to meet those of our captor--they were emotionless, clinical eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I could only scowl in disgust at those eyes which robbed us of our freedom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What lie in wait for us was a life in chains, no better than a dog's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>At the time, Kaede was still a baby, so that prison was all she ever knew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We were imprisoned for being demons. We lost our freedom for being demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…Everything was because we were demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The humans referred to us as "samples."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We weren't given proper meals, only the bare minimum to survive, which they administered through some kind of injection--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And they just left us there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The concept of time became a cruel joke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I don't remember exactly how long we were there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But Kaede's steady growth marked the passage of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>…Kaede.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Kaede's entire world was that prison--ever since she could remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Never knowing the taste of food or the vast blue sky. Her world was that of senseless cruelty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Despair was her world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And then, one day…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Kaede asked me--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Tamba, is this…normal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Is it normal not being able to move--this tiny room...this pain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If this is normal…I think I hate "normal."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>…! No, Kaede! This ISN'T normal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Walking freely beneath the blue sky, the wonder of flavors dancing in your mouth…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Kaede knew none of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It didn't matter how hard I tried to explain. Words weren't enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I wished there were someway I could tell her. But I couldn't find the right words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>She fell silent after.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I doubt anyone could comprehend the despair and powerlessness I felt in that moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>If only I were stronger. Kaede wouldn't have to suffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>If only I could set her free. But that day never came--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Until…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>There. Eat your food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>…!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It was the first meal since we were captured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Without realizing what I was doing, I devoured the food in front of me. The sumptuous taste that spread across my tongue conveyed that it was meat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ah! Who knew the act of eating could feel so exquisite!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>In an instant, our days of despair were gone. We were in heaven--basking in light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Uhh...Uh… Tamba… Tamba…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I looked at Kaede's face and it seemed to say what I had suspected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>This was the first meal she's ever had in her life. She probably didn't know how to eat it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>But her instincts were telling her--"Eat."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>The sensations from her tastebuds, her full stomach--I'm certain she felt happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>…Kaede!...Kaede!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>We called each other's name, savoring an indescribable emotion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Tears welled up in her eyes. That alone was enough to make my emotions swell, reaching a crescendo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>That feeling was my light. For the first time, Kaede knew what "normal" was supposed to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>That light gave me the strength to go on--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>And the memory of that moment was forever imprinted in my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>…But</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I didn't realize at the time…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That "light" was fake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>In fact, it was the cause of even greater despair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I wonder how much time passed after that meal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Certainly enough for us to forget the taste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Once again, we were given a respite of "light."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Here. Feeding time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>The "light!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Just when that thought crossed my mind--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>…!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>…!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>*Chomp*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It wasn't flavorless, although garbage would have tasted better. Every fiber of my being rejected it--my mouth, tongue, cells.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Blechhhh…Blechhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I caught a glimpse of Kaede vomiting as I threw up my food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You bastards! What did you give us--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Just as predicted. XXXX was right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>…What!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>If demons engage in cannibalism, they tend to reject human flesh… And--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>If the cannibalized meat is that of a blood relative, such as a parent, the effect is magnified--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>…Wha--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>…Blechhhhhh!!! Urrrrrfffff!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>…However the effect appears to differ on an individual basis. More research is required before submitting our report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>…!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>…AHH!....AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>What could account for the difference? Sex? Age? Physical attributes? Well, we have plenty of time to find out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Let's conduct a few more experiments, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>…Ooooo….Urrrrrrr</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>…You bastards!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>…How dare you! How dare you!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I won't forgive you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>First--Let's start with the younger sibling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>…!!! Stop! Do whatever you want to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Just keep your hands off my sister!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Commencing experiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>…Stop!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>STOP IT!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I will never forget the smile that crept onto that human's face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>They didn't give a damn about destroying our lives, but that didn't mean they had any interest in keeping us alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Their sole purpose is to destroy lives…No--to toy with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>…That's what humans do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>While they were cutting up Kaede as they pleased…she said…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>…Tamba</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>…Is this…normal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>…......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>...........................</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>...................................................</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>…I couldn't allow it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Not the humans who deprived us of normal lives...or myself--for allowing it to happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Anything that deprives Kaede of a normal life…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>This treatment, this resentment, this hatred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>And this senseless cruelty…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>For the first time, I wanted to fight back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>For my sister--to protect Kaede.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>The power to fight against senseless cruelty. The power to protect…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>…!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>In this land rooted in sin, power itself is sin. To unearth that power is also a sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Those with power seek ever more power in the name of benevolence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>That evokes further sin. Sin begets sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>…What you desire is already in your possession, however you have not yet realized it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>This land is destined to accumulate more and more sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I hate--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I hate the humans who did this to us--who robbed Kaede of a normal life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I hate everything about them. I want to protect Kaede from all of them. That is why--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>I must kill them. The ones who did this to us, those wretched humans who captured us--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Every last one.</td>
</tr>
