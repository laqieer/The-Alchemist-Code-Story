<td>…Wait a minute. So, you're saying that demons and humans got along?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's true. I told you it's not a fairy tale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But… I can't believe my eyes. No way... How could--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There once was a time when demons and humans were two sides of the same coin… There's no reason they can't get along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>True... But why are things the way they are now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Let's take our time and unravel that mystery, piece by piece…as we continue our story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Kaede, where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I need to do more training today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…Oh. How's it going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…It's going well. I feel indebted to the Discarnate Power for rescuing us…and to you…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's why I want to become stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>…It's nothing. Be careful, alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>…I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>…Something on your mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>…No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You cannot fool me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...I feel like Kaede is hiding something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>…You are free to wonder, but remember--We must prioritize the survival of the demon race and the eradication of mankind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes, of course. It's just that lately Kaede hasn't spent much life force, has she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So you noticed, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Of course I did. Why hasn't her life forced diminished lately? This has never happened before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Perhaps she can finally eat humans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>She would have told me. There's no way she can eat humans! But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Is that your burden to bear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…If not me, then who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Your focus lies elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…You have a long way to go before you become “king.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>…Isn't the “king” supposed to bear all burdens?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Nay. He is the one who weeds out the rabble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>…There isn't a problem if I do both, right--carry all burdens and weed out the rabble?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hmm... It seems like he's still too shortsighted. But...this may prove useful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What we desire is a land of demons. We will eliminate the humans and rule everything. That...is the desire of this land--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>…and therefore mine as well.</td>
</tr>
