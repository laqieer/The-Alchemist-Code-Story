<td>Well, isn't this a familiar sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Just as well. I can deal with two annoyances at one go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I won't permit you to remain a thorn in my master's side any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Goetia will not care a whit how much you or your 'master' gives in their name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Nothing will come of it save deaths in vain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Don't presume to lecture me when you, too, came to Goetia in desperation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We are all but poor players upon this laughable stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But enough talk! You've outlived your role!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(This blade again!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Emrys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Slippery little minx...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You've meddled long enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I WILL have your blood this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>They just keep coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There's not much Alchemia in the atmosphere left to use, either...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>*BZZZ...*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What the-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Now's our chance!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>A pinch of flash powder ignites in the chaos, blanketing the fields in burning bright lights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>By the time Nesha blinks the stars out of her eyes, all that remains are malfunctioning Constructs and dead guards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Master won't be pleased to hear of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>My lady! Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well enough...and so are you, by the looks of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Cowering in a corner while the Constructs did your work for you, hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>N-no, my lady! It's just- They were uncontrollable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You saw how that bot of theirs shorted them out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Mm, yes. An unfortunate development.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You felt that too, didn't you, Agares?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'd heard that the little Queen and the Director's grumbling suit had been on the receiving end of something similar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Used against us, the Construct army would be as good as a scrap metal mountain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>M-My lady...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Don't interrupt me, you dullard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Collect the rest of your mewling crew, whatever is left of them, and pay for your failures back at base!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But... The Constructs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No longer your concern, since it requires a creature of intelligence to operate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Leave me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, do not doubt that there will be a reckoning, 'heroes'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Nothing will stand in Master's way. Nothing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ahahaha...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The rest of the week passed in a blur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Interestingly, Goetia did not pursue us with the dogged fervor I had expected of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Turning away from those grim thoughts, I focused my attentions on my lord and my sister instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Soon, we found ourselves once more in Professor Minerva's humble home...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>One that has gotten rather crowded, I must admit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yet one that felt as warm and safe as I dared hope it could be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You have saved us once again, Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm afraid a lifetime of gratitude might not even be enough at this rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Don't say that. It's thanks to Shion's tip-off about Goetia that we were able to prepare in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I wish I knew what Clotho- um, the Director, was thinking...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>In a way, this really is all my fault. Stopping this feels like the right thing to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But never doubt that we are here for you, Soren. You need not shoulder these burdens alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Indeed. I held out as long as I could when they interrogated us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Save for Asuka and those who worked directly on the Atropos project, no one else knows of the details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Still, I would not blame them if anything were to slip their tongues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Li Wang is a monster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Stop fussing, Shion. I'm fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Says the woman who put up a valiant last stand and laid bleeding in my arms the last time I saw her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Never do that again. Promise me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Given Goetia's escalating war, I don't think it's possible to avoid that if they come upon us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But at the very least, I'll try, alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>No one wants to see their sibling in grave danger. I can see Shion cares deeply for you, Lady Asuka.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>That is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>So many new Sis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Big...family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>And you must be Eira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Don't you worry. We'll make sure nothing ever happens to anyone's siblings again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Happy Sis...happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You're so cute, it's almost unbelievable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Ehe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>We're back! Did we miss anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Unfortunately, we weren't able to recover the guard bot after all. It's too damaged to be of use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>But I've collected enough data from our experimental add-on, thanks to Lachesis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I don't know what I did, but happy to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I should be able to build a device that simulates Alchemical disruption, albeit on a small scale...so long as there's enough in the atmosphere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It's a lot better than nothing. You always amaze me, Blair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Let us hope it is enough for them to reconsider their relentless assaults against us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>There must be a way to dissuade Clotho from her path without further bloodshed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>There has to be...</td>
