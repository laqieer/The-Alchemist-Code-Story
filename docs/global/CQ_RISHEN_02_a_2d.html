<td>Yaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ugh... This teamwork is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You were all talk. Just a pathetic excuse for a man with an underhanded plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You could never beat us like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Heh heh... So naive. Even as we speak... Our fleet is moving to send your ship to the bottom of the sea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What? Your target was never us... But the Xiao Shenmei!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The young must have their wings clipped early. Heh... A bunch of leaderless rabble were never any match for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Liu Shen! Everyone's in danger! We must get back to the ship!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Xiao-Xiao...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I wanted to ally with these pirates because I figured if we were enemies, they would crush us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But in the end, it has come to this. Therefore, I will take responsibility and return to the ship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But you, Xiao-Xiao...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If things do not go well, Su Yi cannot be left all alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I will not flee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I believe in our crew, and they have put their faith in us. We will fight together as we always have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It is the strength of our mutual trust that has led the Xiao Shenmei through even the darkest of times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Xiao-Xiao...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And of course, I believe in you too, Liu Shen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This is your captain's order! Let's find a way out of this... together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I guess I lost sight of who my people are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But no more. For those who fight even now, we'll go forth and turn the tides!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes! And that's why you're the first mate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But even if we hurry, it's just the two of us. We're vastly outnumbered, and we don't know what state the ship is in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh! Then we should increase our numbers too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But how will we...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We'll need to negotiate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>There are a lot of monsters in their cages. They seem starved and ferocious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>These monsters are won over and controlled using food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Whatever direction they all happen to look is likely where the food will be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I noticed you'd paid close attention to the other's ship. So this is what you saw!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Now, if we get them out of their cages, we can turn the battle around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'll break the cages, and you'll need to get to and warn the crew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Okay, let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But make me a promise. You will be sure to protect yourself first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Okay, I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>They just came out of nowhere... Damn... Hold your ground! I'm sure the captain will be here soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>All hands on deck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Cease fighting! Make a retreat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>And the first mate! But even if we fall back, how can we possibly get away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Just trust in us! We've fought hard to make it this far, and we'll see this through too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Heh, don't think you can run from us! Wait... What's that sound?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>M-monsters! Someone broke the cages?! They're attacking the main ship! You there, fight them off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>All right, the enemy forces are starting to fall! Now's the time to fight back! Have at them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Everyone, chaaarge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Aye!</td>
</tr>
