<td>Huff...huff... I won't let you lay a finger on him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I assume you are acting out of naive loyalty.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Do you see your master for who he really is, boy?</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Don't you realize you're being fed a twisted version of the truth?</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Shut up!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ack! At this rate...</td>

<td>007</td>
<td>It's all right! Dad and Dias should be here any moment now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So, you're buying time. Very well. In deference to your overbearing chivalry, we'll take our leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Y-you're gonna run?!</td>

<td>The king may witness this drama of revenge unfold, and when he is at the edge of despair, he will be thrust into hell.</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>As for you... I wonder just how well you can protect the one you desire to protect.</td>

<td>Wait, Logi! You were wielding Alchemy just now, weren't you?!</td>

<td>Your Majesty, we must request for the Holy Guard to be dispatched.</td>

<td>No! There's no time to wait for the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Matters of Alchemy are all handled at the discretion of the Holy Guard.</td>

<td>That is the law of Babel defined in the Magna Code.</td>

<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This could very well develop into a continent-wide crisis. Your use of Alchemy is undoubtedly forbidden.</td>
