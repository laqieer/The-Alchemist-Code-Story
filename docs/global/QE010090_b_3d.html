<td>Huzzah!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Logi! Sabareta!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...Grroogh...grooo...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huff...huff...! Yes! We did it, Sabareta! We...won!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I never thought the day would come...when the knights of our two kingdoms would work hand-in-hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Father...I have a request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I want to propose peace treaty to King Patrick, one between the Kingdom of Wratharis and the Kingdom of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What did you say...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I want to stop the cycle of despair created by Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If Envylia can support Wratharis in its recovery, then we should be able to restore peace to this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Allow me to persuade him! If I can convince him as one born of Wratharis blood...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Agatha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's true that having fought hand in hand is a big first step.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>However...it's not that simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If it were the words of a mere citizen, I doubt anyone would listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>However...what if they were the words of one descended from the royal family of Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I know the truthâ€”that you are trying to hide what you have erased from history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If you have no ulterior motives for having made this girl your daughter, you should be able to clarify the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Or...were you somehow planning on using her lineage to your advantage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't speak nonsense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I don't know how you came across that information, but I have no ulterior motives for having taken Agatha in as my daughter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I wanted to protect her from the troubles that would befall one of her lineage...that is all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Her lineage? What does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It appears I can no longer keep it a secret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Agatha...there is something I must tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>O-okay...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's about your origin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I told you that I discovered you at the battlefield of the Dawn of Wrath, where Wratharis was destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>However, that is not the truth. Where I really did encounter you was within the royal castle of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Within the royal castle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes. Agatha...you are the legitimate heir to the Kingdom of Wratharis; you are none other than the princess of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>A-Agatha...the princess of Wratharis?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The royal lineage of the enemy kingdom must be cut off...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That was my intention when I headed for the royal castle. However, what I saw there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...was the royal family, already destroyed by the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Is that your excuse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Even if you didn't dirty your own hands, if you were in a position to prevent it but didn't, you're just as guilty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I make no excuses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>At that time...seeing the devastation occur before my eyes, I was prepared to shoulder all responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The Holy Order of Babel and its suzerain power is absolute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I discarded my empathy and searched within the castle to see whether there were any of the royal family left alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It was then that I heard the cries of a baby.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Was that...me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>With his dying breath, your true father, the king of Wratharis...continued to hide you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>If I did not discard my empathy, the cycle of sorrow would continue. Thus, I resolved myself and pointed my blade towards you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>However, at that moment...your little fingers clutched my foot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The warmth I could feel from your small hand halted my movement</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Just as I was about to step into the path of darkness, I was saved by you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Father...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Forgive me, Agatha... Forgive me for hiding this from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Father...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>As Agatha descends from the royal family of Wratharis, the king might listen to her words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I want you to find a way for our two kingdoms to work hand in hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Sabareta...will you help these children carry out their dream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Zeke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I'll advise King Patrick to hold a meeting between our two kingdoms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I'll also suggest he consider the establishment of a Wratharis dominion with Agatha as its representative, thus connecting both our kingdoms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Envylia and...Wratharis...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I-is such a thing possible?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I know it's hard to believe! But, we're not lying to you! Please...believe us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Make one wrong move and, from that moment forth, consider your lives forfeit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Sabareta! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>All right! Now that that is decided, let's hurry on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>There are avoidable conflicts happening even now in various places!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Wow! My idealized dreams may actually come to fruition!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>We might truly embrace a gentle and peaceful future...Dias!</td>
