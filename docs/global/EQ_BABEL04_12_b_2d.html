<td>Burdock, corpses. Spring herbs, toadstools. Cucumber, winter melon.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Count to one hundred, and you get a demon!</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>According to Yomi's memories, this is the Kagomurasaki Clan's demon statue.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Once I release the corruption from inside it, that will be the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Good, good! Finally!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The end of the world of humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>And the beginning of the world of demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>At long last. I have been waiting for so very long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh man, me too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I was starting to go nuts waiting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's not all about the chasing, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>When you play tag...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sometimes you have to, y'know...go for the ambush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ah... A Black Star.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Did you know that I've never failed to kill anyone I've set my eye on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No one, except for Jin—oh, and one other numbskull.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's my clan's duty to exorcise you demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I just couldn't bring myself to kill Jin after you took possession of him, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You know, I always thought that things like faith, and intent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Were just a means for us to live by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Funny isn't it? People change so easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Once upon a time, there was a boy who believed that static things like codes and traditions were everything. He didn't mind following them, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But, Jin, now... That guy never changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, right up until the point he turned into a demon, anyway. Grr, argh, and all that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>He chose his own path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>He decided whether he would follow the rules, turn his back on them, or serve his own interests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>His sister is the same, come to think of it... Quite the pair, those two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You are every bit the dutiful little brat, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Me? Nah. I just wanted to give choosing my own path a try, for once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hm? That's—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huzzaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Losing someone you stood back to back with once upon a dream is...kinda lonely, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>So I'm really just being selfish here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Cause I really don't like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Sumeragi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I totally called it, by the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Jin's body was stolen, the Discarnate Power disappeared...and protecting Sumeragi fell to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I couldn't refuse the head of the Kagomurasaki, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>So...I didn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hmm, y'know what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Lending someone a hand isn't so bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And as it turns out...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I don't hate doing things fair and square, either.</td>
