<td>Ohh... What should we do for fun today? Hey, Rin?</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yip?! Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What's the matter? You've been spacing out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Actually...I met a boy tanuki the other day. He seemed like he wanted to say something, but he ended up just scurrying off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>A boy?! Wait, is that...is that...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>N-no, it's not like that! It's just that when I wonder about him, I get worried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Worried?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yeah. He was all alone. I worry that he's lonely. I wouldn't like to be all alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Mm... Hey! Where did you see that boy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Umm...umm... Where was it again? Oh! I think it was near an old shrine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A shrine? Was there a shrine around here? Well, anyway, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You feel worried, right? In that case, let's try meeting that boy again! I'm curious as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh! You're right! We can ask him directly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>All right then... Off we go to find the shrine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yip!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...So, which way is this shrine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I forgot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Th-then, let's go to the places you're prone to visiting, Rin! At the same time, we can engage in a little mischief!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey, you! Wait! I've had enough of your tiresome mischief!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's not tiresome! It's real entertaining to see your angry face, old man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ohh! Wait! It's dangerous to run off over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oww...ahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Grrr....graaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This angry face isn't entertaining at all!</td>
