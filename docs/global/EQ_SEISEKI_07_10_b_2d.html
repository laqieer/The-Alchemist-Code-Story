<td>Face reality...!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>None of you seem to be aware that you're about to repeat the same tragedy that occurred in Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I will do absolutely everything I can to prevent that from happening!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's a mistake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Allowing the Mikaboshi to remain in this world is the same as allowing the existence of something that has the power to ruin the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We need to do everything we can to find the Mikaboshi and eliminate it from this world!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No! How can you not consider the fact that destroying the Mikaboshi may not necessarily serve justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That instead would lead to destroying the balance of power in this world and lead to its destruction!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No! Wadatsumi was destroyed precisely because of the Mikaboshi existence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi is the culprit for producing conflict in this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ack...! Is there nothing I can do to make you see things differently?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'd ask the same of you! Can I not get you to listen to what I am saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I would've liked to have avoided this...but I guess there's no choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If we cannot see justice under the same terms...then, as knights, we must determine matters with our swords.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...Fine. As Lord Commander I accept your proposal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I've discarded my empathy, Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>In order to protect this world and the equilibrium of power, I will become the "supreme judge"!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I will as well, Captain Kudan! I will open your eyes to reality!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The End!!!</td>

<tr>

<td>Eternal Glow!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>!!! Wh-when did you gain...so much power...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ag...ghh...! I'd ask the same of you, Captain! I had no idea your power of darkness had increased to this point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Still...my resolve...is on another level than all of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I...have...seen...the destruction...of Wadatsumi! I have seen...its...despair...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I have seen...Kagura...living...with despair...beyond...imagination!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ug...ugh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I will...never...allow...that tragedy...to be repeated...again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Even if...no one...understands me...even if...the whole world...turns against...me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I will...save...this world...from such...despair!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hurrrahhhh!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Aghh...!!! Ackkk!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Kanon!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's over...Kanon...I ask you...once again! Your answer...will decide...whether or not...I must make...a ruthless...decision!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>My...my feelings are the same!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Y-you will never be able to save the world with your way of thinking, Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's...an unfortunate...answer...Kanon. Farewell!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Kudan...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...Kagura? Is that...you...Kagura?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Kudan...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Kagura! You're safe...I've come to save you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>To save me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>They were going to use you again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>But you're okay now...as long as I am here, I won't let them harm you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Kudan...is it true that you killed...Commander Zain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...! It is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Zain had the wrong mentality. I can't explain it you easily now. I'll explain my actions properly to you later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Agh! N-no...! I will not let you take Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Shut up! You are all leading the world to its destruction! I won't let you have Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What are you saying...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You should all examine your own vulnerability! Your weakness is what is allowing you to be taken advantage of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Your lack of strength has turned you into the culprits that will bring about the destruction of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ugh! Ar-are you still going on about that?! We are not being taken advantage of...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>As long as you choose to turn a blind eye to your own weakness, you will never realize the truth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>At least I am coming face to face with my own vulnerabilities!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I am painfully aware that my lack of strength is the cause for all of this! I am not like you who cannot face your own weakness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What...are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If I had the power to destroy the Mikaboshi, Zain would have never tried to use Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>If I had enough power, I would've been able to save you all from walking down the wrong path!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>If only I had the power, I would be able to maintain the balance of this world again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Without a "supreme judge" in the world right now, unless someone can replace that power, there will be no future for this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Are you saying that you're going to maintain the balance of this world, Captain Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yes! I cannot ensure the fate of this world to you Paladins who have been infiltrated by the Corpse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I will obtain even further power and become the "supreme judge"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Instead of the Lord Commander, I will be the one to maintain the equilibrium of power in this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I will eliminate all dangers that threaten this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>There will come a day when all of you will understand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Captain...Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>This...is where...it ends!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Vermilion Bird!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>..Kagura?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I'm sorry...Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Wh-what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You needed to protect me...that's why you continued to seek power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I was so weak...that I needed your protection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I am sure that it was me who killed your original, gentle self.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Kagura! What are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>But...you're wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>The people of Wadatsumi do not seek power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Power drives people mad. The people of Wadatsumi understood this. That's why they continued to hide the Mikaboshi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>The people of Wadatsumi would never accept your way of thinking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Your way of thinking...is the same as those who destroyed Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Are you...calling me the same as them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I don't want what you offer either! I cannot accept your way of thinking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ka...Kagura...will you reject it? Will you reject...me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I'm...sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ugh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>...Goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Goodbye...my precious...Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>!!! Uggaahhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Ka-Kagura...!!! Wh-why...?! Ackkkkk!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Ca-Captain Kudan...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Wh-why? You were the one thing...I needed to protect. Even you...will turn against me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>...Hwaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>...Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>...Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...?! M-my body...I can't seem to control it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Kagura...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Is this...truly the path I must take? Must I truly discard everything...to become the "supreme judge"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Ca-Captain Kudan...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>...I guess that means the world I must belong to is one void of love...and light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Very well. Then with delight...I will accept the darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>In order to protect this world...I will gladly walk down this path! Hurraaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>N-no! Kanon, run...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...it appears you seek power at the expense of discarding your own humanity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Hurraahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Kanon! Run!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>What immense power. Yet, you appear so broken at the same time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Hurraahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Ka-Kanon...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I won't lose. I cannot afford to lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>You have lost the most important thing that makes you human...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Hurraahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I will lead this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I will build your ideal world that is void of sadness!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Listen to me, reincarnated Holy Sword Excalibur! Give me power!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>...Eternal Glow!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Ugh?! ...Uggggghh...?! Aghhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Ku...Kudan...! ...Kudan!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>On that day, all I could do...was watch as Wadatsumi was destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Confronted with my immense powerlessness, I was overwhelmed with despair...and all I could do was remain standing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Throughout that, the only thing I was able to protect...was Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Her existence...tethered me to this world...even as I was consumed with overwhelming despair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Protecting her was the one thing that kept me going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>If I could not protect her, I felt as if I would no longer exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>However...I came to realize that what I was doing was running away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I had to look into the future, not into the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>What I needed to protect was not my vulnerable past self, but the future of this vast world itself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I must not hesitate to obtain power! I must not turn away from the strongest of opponents!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>If I were to stand aside, then who would save this world?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Farewell...beautiful days...farewell...my beloved friends...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>For the sake of maintaining the balance of this world...for the sake of becoming the "supreme judge" who will protect the peace of this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I will gladly descend into the darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Kudanstein...so he fell into the darkness after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Waginau...hurry and go convene the Veda Templars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Do you mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>The voice of birth cries out...with the conception of a new era!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>!!! Understood...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>The eternal river of history continues to flow through this world. So...you've chosen this path after all...heheh...hyahahaha!!!</td>
