<td>He was so good at spinning tops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The top would spin on and on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>He would spin one for me whenever I would start crying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It always cheered me up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I would beg to have a turn, take the top from him, and practice with all my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Now don't just force it. You wrap the yarn around and around like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Around and around! Then what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Then you relax your shoulders and fling it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Relax, then...fling it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hahahahaha! Not bad, not bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It brought me joy when I could spin the top well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It made me feel like I could make my brother happy, the same way he made me happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Soon, I became skilled with a blade as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The promise we made under those stars...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>To protect Wadatsumi together...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I was a disappointment to my father, who desperately wanted a son for the sake of the Kagomurasaki Clan's traditions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I wanted to make my father proud. As the future head of the clan, and to keep the promise I made with my brother, I spent my days training furiously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I would come home all bruised and worn, and my brother would gently brush the tangles from my hair. It always made me feel better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>He helped me forget how I could never live up to my father's expectations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>To protect Wadatsumi, to keep my promise with my brother, and to gain my father's approval...I pushed myself to the limit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then...my brother killed my father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>He killed everyone in the clan, broke our promise, and ran away from home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>He was so good at spinning tops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Uh-oh. Whoops. Definitely took a wrong turn somewhere, haha. Erm, so... There was another way into the mansion, but it was a while back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That would cost us precious time! We push on through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Aw, Jin... I know we're in a bit of a hurry, but haven't you heard that haste makes waste?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Right...but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Who's that there, plotting away? I am Leafah, General of Greed Dike! Do not think I will hesitate to apprehend interlopers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You two alone wouldn't want to fight all of us now, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We aren't anybody you need to be concerned with. We're just on our way to the Shiba Senko mansion to save Yomi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ren!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Trust me, this is easier. If they aren't the type to negotiate, then we'll just force our way through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Did you say Yomi? What do you mean by saving her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The Shiba Senko are planning on exploiting Yomi for her Discarnate Power? Are you serious?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That would be such a weird thing to lie about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm also going to take back the sword that can dispel the demon from her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You mean Sumeragi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yeah. I mean, the Shiba Senko've got their hands on both the Discarnate Power that threatens Wadatsumi, and Sumeragi, the sword that can exorcise its influence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Not exactly ideal, now is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Then it would seem that your goals align with ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh, really? Sweet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Greed Dike intends to manage and regulate the turmoil within Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Unfortunately for you, there are rumors that you are the root of all of this chaos...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Jin, the Demonic Killer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Whew! Ain't you famous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You're seen as an aggressor against the Shiba Senko, who have now allied with the Kagomurasaki in order to hide away your sister and exploit her powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The question now arises as to whom I should believe—the monster who killed his entire family, or the Shiba Senko, the most prominent clan in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh, shoot. This does not look good. Do you take bribes? Uh-oh, should I not have said that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What do you get out of saving Yomi, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Erm, I just sort of got mixed up in this, but if I had to give a reason...? I guess it would be to take the next step forward. I figured I've run from my responsibilities for long enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>And you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I want to help Yomi face her future. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>So, you think Yomi is averting her eyes from her own future?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What do you know of her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>We watched each other's backs...once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If I'm the reason she can't move on with her life, then it's my duty to free her from what's holding her back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I must help her come to terms with her past...with what I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Let them pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>G-General?! We're going to take them at their word?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>He speaks like Yomi, with the same glimmer in his eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What do you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>When you lose your way, heed the voices of the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>There have been those who showed me their determination, and there have been those who poured out their hearts and souls before me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Ever since I was little, I have been despised and looked down upon. As a result, I do not trust others easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Who really does, though, right? Right? No one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>A person's eyes will reveal whether they are lying to me or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We, too, are looking away from the past and toward the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I will take full responsibility! Let them pass!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Hahaha! Well, that went better than expected! Buh-bye now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Jin, why do you choose to shoulder all of your burdens alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Ren is an idealist, but reality is harsh. It does not concern an outsider like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Let me tell you a secret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>A secret?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You wish to save your sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I wish to...g-gain a...f-friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>This is the only place we haven't looked yet. It has to be here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Th-this is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Sumeragi, the legendary sword! It...looks just like an ordinary sword. Can it really exorcise demons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Oh, wait, I remember my sister saying something about how to get Sumeragi to exorcise demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Oh well. The Discarnate Power hasn't shown itself, so there's no harm in just taking this—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Whoooaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>The intruder's caught in the trap! Get him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>An alarm? As soon as I pick up the sword?! Oh, nooo. I'm sooo scaaared. How'd you guys get this to work, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Oh. Wow. That's a lot of guards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Haha! This is getting good! This is getting really good! Thanks for the warm welcome!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Are you nervous that I'm not nervous? Smart! I'll give you a hint as to who's going to be in trouble in a moment: It's not me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I knew something was off, ever since I heard Yomi's story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Yomi said she doesn't like the idea of having to kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>There's no way someone like you would kill his entire family without a legitimate reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>If your plan is to protect Yomi, then I'll lend you a hand. Anything f-for a f-f-friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Why would an outsider from Greed Dike want to meddle in my private affairs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I-I said...anything for a f-friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>You should just leave me be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Wow. You are really terrible at hiding your true feelings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I never said I was good at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>It's written all over your face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>What is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>That you're hurting inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Psh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Ha! Hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Having been charged with oversight of the general state of Wadatsumi, I cannot simply leave you to your troubles!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Hahaha! Such a childish assumption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Who're you calling childish?! I just look young!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Hah! No doubt about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>It's just a pity that your maturity doesn't show because of your baby face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>You dare...? Why does it feel like I'm still being patronized?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Will you lend me a hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I thought I was an outsider.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I can't call someone who wants to become my sister's friend an outsider.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>You listened to her when she had much to get off her chest, did you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Well, yes. Just for a little while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>That's more than enough. In fact, I'd be grateful if you could continue to lend her your ear going forward. Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>As her friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Jin, you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>What's written all over my face this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Something...I hope I'm reading correctly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Come! For both Greed Dike and Wadatsumi's sakes, we must combine our strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>We are not here to slaughter! We came to unveil the cause of turmoil in Wadatsumi! Onward, to the Shiba Senko mansion!</td>
</tr>
