<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I have to lay down the law.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>A bit tyrannical, don't you think? King of Lost Blue?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It is. I will force this lawless Lost Blue to its knees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There are too many empty promises of justice, salvation, and the like floating around here that never amount to anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Mm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I can't believe those words anymore. I can only believe in those I see fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Words won't do anything for those who've been ostracized by this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Not words, not justice, but rules built upon the will of those who are willing to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You have the power to make that happen, Dead Nine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>And you have the willpower for it, Rat-Killer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hehe, thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So the only thing in the way is that ceiling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Guys like you make me sick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Only sickening people live here in Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Your kind always talk down to others from above. Is that how all philosophers are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I just enjoy pointless things. It's pointless to speak of ideals down here. My intellectual curiosity desires more futility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Things like, wondering what it means to live, or what color the sky is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I...think I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Do you?! It's intriguing isn't it? Hey, Dead Nine! You have a good friend here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This is nonsense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh, come on. You can go on forever about your muscles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>There's nothing pointless about my muscles!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm just saying, your ridiculously expansive knowledge of muscles is meaningless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>All I hear is "Poop-poop-be-doop!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hmmm? A bit fixated on poop, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ugh... Is everybody in Lost Blue so vulgar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, we are at the lowest possible social class, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>How far are you taking us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The deepest point. The central depths of Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Don't you want to see the other side of the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The...other side?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This is the portal to the other world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What theâ€”? Everything's getting distorted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This is like a landing on a flight of stairs between dimensions. Just walk gently forward and you'll make it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>W-what is this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's so...big!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>There are no ceilings here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But...no sky, either. Just a tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What is going on?! How can there be a tower that huge in a cave underground?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You see, Redington City, the city we live under, was once a flying city in the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Well, it's what remains of one after sinking to the bottom of the ocean, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Long ago, something caused the city to rise up from the ocean and formed land around it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The resulting pocket below the city is what we now call Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There are probably several factors at work that pushed the city back up, but I believe that this dimension and the tower are involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Mystic Tower Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>There is an incredibly dense current of Alchemia that can't be seen rising high into the air.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>And that pushed Slothstein's land up from the other side of the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I think so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The Alchemia circulating through the Alchemy Source is said to be high above in the heavens and the earth itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That which is imperceptible in the real world is manifested in this dimension as a tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It's considered to be another face of the Tower of Babel, or a parallel universe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>My brain isn't following.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Mine either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>A colossal island that carries destruction. Exactly on point, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>When the land was pushed up, this dimension couldn't handle the sudden burst of energy, and time-space was torn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It was just a small tear, but that must have become that portal we walked through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Lost Blue's intellectuals have been studying this phenomenon for ages, using stolen Slothstein tech.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>And so, they've made travel between the worlds possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I just wanted to see a different view.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Will we be able to see from the top of that tower?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>We wouldn't know until we climbed it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Why climb the tower? Because it's there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Ridiculous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>There is great Alchemical power waiting for us at the top of this other-worldly tower. At least, that's what the intellectuals believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Power is everything, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>So why not take it for ourselves and flip this world on its end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Heh, that's one futile, crazy ambition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Want me to go bigger? World domination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Taking on the world with power from another dimension...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Pretty cool, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Is that why you brought us here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>It's almost impossible to climb to the top of Veda. There are lost Phantoms roaming about, drawn to the concentrated Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Very few have reached the top levels of the tower. I've formed parties on several occasions to challenge the tower, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Heh, and you still want to take on the world? What a laugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I'm powerless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Everything in this world scares me. The overpopulated cities, cesspools filled with hate and deceit...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You're scared...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>What else can I do but be somewhat pretentious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I see what you mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You say you're the king, the law of Lost Blue... I figured I ought to get the law on my side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I want you to come with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Not happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Should I beg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>You wouldn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I can try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>If you want a king to do what you want... Well, you know what to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Does it have to come to this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I hear you're really tough, Dead Nine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You better let me handle this alone, Rat-Killer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>We won't let anybody own us again.</td>
</tr>
