<td>Wind Shaman...it's been a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What are you doing here, Georgios?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I paid a visit to Voda in order to coax the whereabouts of Beelzebub out of her. Unfortunately, she wasn't home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So I came to ask Fuu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'd like to ask the same of you. What are you doing here? This isn't your faction. Are you here with that Shaman from the Fuu faction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's got nothing to do with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tina! Calm down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Heheh. Just as I expected. I am truly delighted to meet you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They're after the Sacred Stone. It appears they've come to visit Fuu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The Sacred Stone! Fuu knows nothing about it. I'm sorry, but you'll have to leave this place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm certain he knows something about its whereabouts. My information comes from a reliable source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A...reliable source?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes...from the Earth Sprite Tehre!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...?! Why would Tehre give information to the Gluttony army?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh? Perhaps that boy has formed an alliance with the Gluttony army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Voda!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh...so you're the Water Sprite Voda!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What good fortune to encounter you here! Now, how about you tell me the location of the Sacred Stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Heheh. I have nothing to say to a youngster like you. You'd best gracefully take your leave of this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Unfortunately, I wouldn't have come all this way here if I intended to gracefully take my leave...take that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Heheh. You wear your thirst for blood on your sleeve. With such obvious moves, there's no way you can kill me. Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Whaaat?! I'm impressed, Voda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tell me one thing: how are you connected with Tehre?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That has nothing to do with our current battle. If you don't focus, you may end up paying dearly for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But it has everything to do with this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That boy is connected with the lot of you. Whatever the reason, it changes my motivation for this conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I have only one thing to say to you: Tehre is an invaluable ally to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Honestly. That little brat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Aghhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Wow! She took out Georgios with a single blow! This is the power...of the Sprite Trio!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>General Georgios!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I haven't got time to waste on you. There's a brat out there who needs a good lecturing from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...! He's not finished yet! Voda! Behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Heheheh! You make me happy, Voda! How powerful you are, even without your Ouija!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>However, you underestimated me...and that is your downfall. Farewell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Noooo!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Agh! Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I am the Fire Sprite Fuu. If you think you can prance about this land doing as you please, lad, you're mistaken!</td>
