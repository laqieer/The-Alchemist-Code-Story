<td>H-how can there be so many?! Wh-what's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There's no end to them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This explains why the soldiers were unable to return with the medicinal herbs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wh—?! Hey! Shenmei...is gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We were separated?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We need to find Shenmei! I'll go and see if I can find her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Grrrraaaarrrrggggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Argh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Nnnrrgghh! You have a reckless side to you as well, I see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>P-Protector?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I will protect you, no matter what! For I am a Protector, the shield of adventurers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Thank you, Protector...and, um, sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hmm. I understand how you feel, but if you rush off by yourself, you might end up being the one who ends up separated from your companions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I would appreciate it if you had a little more faith in us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're right. Okay... Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well, it is only natural that we would worry. There are far too many monsters here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Please, be quiet for a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wh-what is it? I don't appreciate—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hush!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I can hear...the sounds of battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It must be Shenmei. Let us hurry to her aid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Blaaarrrrggggghhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ngh! There are...too many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Gunner! You're all here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Shenmei! Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Sorry, guys! I've got a terrible sense of direction, and I kinda got swept away when the fighting started... Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's fine. All that matters is that you are safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That aside, you found Shenmei incredibly quickly, Gunner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I am a Gunner, after all. Tracking in the forest is a fundamental skill. It's quite simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I... I see. Your way of speaking can be...callous, but I really admire your skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hm... Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Gunner? What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I heard...a voice. A cry of pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ah! It's coming from over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Nnngh... Urrrggghh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>These must be the soldiers who came looking for medicinal herbs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You, there! Get a hold of yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Th-the flower... Nngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>They're out cold... What do you think they were trying to say about flowers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Flowers, hmm? Perhaps they are the medicinal herbs we seek?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Help me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It's that voice again! It's like they're taking turns shouting for our help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It sounded quite close! Let us hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Help me... He...lp...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Welcome...adventurers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>A m-monster! Is this what that soldier meant by flower?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That's Alraune!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Adventurers...p-please...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So that voice belonged to a monster all along?! Why would a monster need our help?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ngh... We've been tricked! Alraune is a terrifying creature. She calls for help in the voice of a young girl, then lies in wait for those poor, kindhearted fools who heed her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>S-so you're saying that we've fallen into a monster's trap?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Yes. However, there's something strange going on. This Alraune is somehow different to the one I have fought before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ah! Is that...a Philosopher's Stone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>A Philosopher's Stone?! Chloe told me about those! They're really powerful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That's right. I bet the Philosopher's Stone is making this monster even stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Gggrrraaaaaggggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>My friends, we have company!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>We should take care of these pests first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Here they come! Get ready!</td>
</tr>
