<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Once upon a time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I took the Scarlet Vow, and swung my katana for my country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>With that vow, I thought I could bring peace to the country of Envylia and the continent of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But that vow, and the desire from which it was born...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They were fleeting—destined to be scattered like petals in the wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Celis. I wish I didn't have to ask this of you, but I have no choice in the matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What are you saying? You've done nothing wrong. If anyone is to blame, it's the Holy Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's a rare sentiment to hear, coming from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm right, though, aren't I? No matter how big a threat these alleged renegades may be, this is simply taking things too far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ordering us to wipe out every single person in the ruins...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Nothing about such an order is unwarranted. Those renegades are under suspicion of using Alchemy, and you know as well as I that we cannot ignore such reports.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But that's what's so strange about it! We keep getting these same reports, always of rogues in the ruins who are "under suspicion" of using Alchemy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So we go in, we wipe them out, and the cycle repeats! And all because we "suspect" they're Alchemists?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Alchemy is a strictly forbidden art, permitted only to be used by the Holy Guard. Those who wield it in defiance have sealed their own fates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But why must we take their lives? They're citizens, just like anyone else, equally deserving of our protection in the end. Should we not give them an opportunity for recompense?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's why this has been my burden to bear up till now. Not yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>As the Blood Wolf, you mean? Even though it wasn't ever supposed to be your burden to bear in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It hardly matters, when it's an order from above. Whether carried out by us or the Scarlet Flame, the end result is no different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Better I dirty my hands than you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Celis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This was meant to be my assignment from the start. I shouldn't be upset that I'm being asked to do it now. But...the orders just keep coming, time and again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Orders to kill innocent people, whose only crime is neither certain, nor worthy of death!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It goes against the spirit of the Scarlet Flame Guard. But I don't wish for you to coddle me by taking that burden of guilt off my shoulders. I've never wanted that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>"Respect none who wield the sword without heart." The second tenet. I can understand how this must seem to be a betrayal of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But please, don't think of the assignments thus far as coddling. I chose them, of my own free will, every time. It just didn't seem right to leave you with such a sad duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's not right to leave it with anyone! By a single whim from the Holy Guard...countless lives are ended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Suspicions have origins, though. And whatever their origins may be, it is we who must act upon them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But taking lives, based on little more than a hunch—even an informed one—is just inexcusable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's why I've been accepting these missions in place of the Scarlet Flame Guard—in your place. But this time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I know. The Blue Flame Guard was clearly assigned this one because they know it's a step too far, and they need a scapegoat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>"They"? So you believe the Holy Order has ulterior motives?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Word's been going around that Captain Vettel, the former leader of the Scarlet Flame Guard, found ancient, Alchemic relics in those ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Supposedly, that's why the Holy Order suddenly declared them off-limits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Despite that, the Holy Order continues to send us into them time and again to kill innocent people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I wish I could have carried the burden this time as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But, why? Why would you ever wish that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Our child shouldn't be held with bloodstained hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Then what of your hands?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I've made my decision. For you, and for Logi alike, I'll carry whatever stigma I must.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Logi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Even if they call me the Blood Wolf... Even if they fear me, I want to protect you both. More than anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Raise your head, my dear. I feel the same as you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Celis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I've made up my mind as well. As Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard, I will complete this mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Are you certain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The Holy Order has their reasons, even if they're not at liberty to tell us what they are. I...can choose to believe that they are acting in the name of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>And that this bloodshed will somehow help bring peace to the Continent of Babel. Moreover...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>For our child's future, I am willing to bloody my hands—even if it means forsaking my Scarlet Vow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I just need to keep my focus on that future, and see to it that it's a happy one. Not just for Logi, but for everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Celis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That was my resolution on that day. And at the time, I truly believed it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's all of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>My humblest apologies for falling behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It wasn't your fault. Our opponents were quite skilled this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The captain is scouting the area now, just in case we missed anyone. If there's no news, that should mean we can take a moment to catch our breath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>May I suggest we fall back for now? We've taken heavy casualties, yet even still, our food supply will not last us to the end of the mission...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Our current status is definitely not ideal, but the ruins are practically at arm's length now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>And if the renegades are attacking us this fiercely at our mere approach, it makes me wonder what they've got hidden inside...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Then this is no time for us to stop. We must figure out what's going on and report it to the Holy Order. That is our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Captain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>The assault from the renegades has been more harrowing than anticipated, but our iron will shall not be so easily shaken!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Shall it, Celis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Of course not! We must see this mission through, at all costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Exactly! So, you lot are to split into two groups.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Vice-Captain Celis and I will take point, keeping watch for any further renegade assaults. We mustn't let our guard down simply because our goal is at hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>My squad will serve as a distraction, while the other will raid the ruins head-on. If we take the enemy will a full push and give it everything we've got, we will not lose this fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Are there any objections?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>None here. As you say, Captain, if we fight them head-on, victory is assured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Excellent. Squad one, behind me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Squad two, behind me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>We'll rendezvous at the entrance to the ruins. I'm counting on you, Celis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Forward, march!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Are our opponents really just civilian renegades?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>So says the Holy Order. If they're wrong, then it's our job to uncover the truth and let them know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It seems like they're up to something, if you ask me. We really should have fallen back and taken stock when we had the chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Perhaps we should've. But, a mission's a mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>As you say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It wouldn't be long, however, until I realized this was no ordinary mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>In fact, nothing could've prepared me for what was to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Don't let up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>But we're very clearly being led, most likely into a trap. Shouldn't we wait for the captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>The captain and his squad are likely engaged with the renegades at this very moment. We'll finish down here, then go back up to assist!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I think it'll be too late for that by the time we're done. But, no turning back now! Not on a mission from the Holy Order. What a mess, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Once we accept our orders, it's do or die. That's just the way it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>(Even if I have to fight without adequate cause, as long as I think to the future, I can persevere...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Let's just hurry up and finish this mission. Then we can put it behind us and go back to being the Scarlet Flame Guard we actually signed up for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>We sure have gone in pretty deep, haven't we? ...Wait, do you hear that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>What's that sound?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Lady Celis! Ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>What is that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Lady Celis, what are your orders?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Fall back! Everyone, to the entrance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I didn't know what it was we'd just seen, but I could tell it was too much for us to handle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>So rather than trying to fight it in the confined spaces of the ruins, we decided to reconvene outside and reassess the situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Sunlight! The entrance was just a little farther ahead. We were almost there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>We intended to meet up with the captain and confront those massive metal beasts as a singular unit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>But our plans were cut short...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>The entrance! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>With a quake and a clatter, a large pile of impossibly huge rocks now blocked the entrance to the ruins. None of us were getting out quite so easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>We had no time to think about it, though. Those "things" were approaching relentlessly. We were going to have to face them, good conditions or no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Here they come!</td>
</tr>
