<td>The Construct shuts down from damage and falls to the ground in a heap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>*cough* Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Soren, you were pretty dazed before. Don't push yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm okay now. My headache is gone. Thanks, Roxanne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's not just Soren. I feel terribly drained as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It most likely has to do with the way it was able to manipulate the concentration of Alchemia particles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The Constructs can produce Alchemia particles?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Not quite. Our particles suffused into the air around us, creating an aura imperceptible to the human eye, but not to its sensors or the monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I would surmise that the higher a person's innate Alchemia particle concentration, the more susceptible they are to this method of attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The ritual back in Sakris Village used the "essence" in the villagers' blood to power their Construct...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Whoever wanted to kidnap Soren might have also known about these Constructs and their properties as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(And it might not be *just* kidnapping, either...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'd say we've had a tad too much excitement for one day. We can continue our investigation once we have recovered from this ordeal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Shall we head for home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Can't wait to settle down for a nice, hot bath. I'm covered in dust and monster drool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>By the time the party returns to Minerva's above, night has fallen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>A curiously familiar face is waiting just outside on the cobblestone path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hey, if it isn't Shion again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>A friend of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah. She got us out of a tight spot in Sakris Village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Good evening. I see that our paths continue to cross...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>And I see Miss Roxanne has joined your merry little band.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah, my apologies. My name is Shion, a retainer to a noble lord of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Minerva.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Something of a parent to these errant children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey, Teach...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Fufu. It must be quite delightful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>On another business trip again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Just sightseeing this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Just sightseeing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Even retainers need to take a little time off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>And let me guess, you just "happened" to come across Teacher's home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I will admit I was more than a little curious, but the Professor's reputation as a talented sorceress is well deserved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Please pardon me for being so forward and arriving unannounced at your abode.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Why, aren't you quite the flatterer! It's not a problem at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yeah... FLAT-terer... *grumble*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Sieg... maybe we should leave...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(Yeah... I can feel the heat from here.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well, I must be off. I shan't disturb your evening any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Take care and see you around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Good night to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I'm gonna take Soren in and have him sit down. He's had quite a day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Come on, kiddo. I'll fix you a nice cup of tea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Sounds good...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You don't like Shion very much, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No! That woman is a fox!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Sieg is too oblivious to figure any of her tricks out. It's a good thing I decided to tag along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What does he see in her anyway? She has none of the makings of a partner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I won't let Sieg settle for some second-rate wife!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh, don't worry, my dear. There's not much of a contest there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hmhmhm. I can't vouch for her, but I know you handle yourself just fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hehe. Even Teacher says so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(Take that, you minx! There's no way I'm losing!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(...A retainer from Wadatsumi, hmm?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(I should look into it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>A short while after Siegfried's party leaves the ruins, two figures emerge from the nearby forest, having watched the situation unfold and resolve from afar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>After making sure the coast is clear, they head towards one of the underground entrances to the facility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>My Lord, it appears they were investigating this room in particular.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Then let us make haste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>The taller figure regards the laboratory with mild interest while the slighter one surveys the debris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Anything of note?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The large Prototype has taken major damage. It doesn't seem to be functional any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What of the memory component?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Intact, my Lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Good. Salvage as much as of the rest as you can. I will have the scholars retrieve and analyze the data later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I am certain there will be much to glean from its encounter with those people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>The taller figure leans against a pillar and begins to muse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>The Professor... I suppose she was bound to show up sooner or later. Her former apprentices coming in search of her was unexpected, but that is fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>After all, the boy was with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Given how previous experiments with the Prototypes had failed to produce any sort of reaction, he may hold the key to unlocking these mysteries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>The slight figure places a hand atop the large Construct in an attempt to dislodge its memory component. Its detectors suddenly blink for a moment, startling the figure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>As quickly as it happened, the Construct goes completely silent again, and the memory component clicks loose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Hmm... It's almost as if it was sentient. Fascinating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I believe that will be all, for now. Contact the rest. We retire for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Certainly, my Lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The slight figure pockets the memory component and gathers up other small materials. The two scan the room one last time before leaving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>They disappear into the night, obscured by the falling darkness.</td>
</tr>
