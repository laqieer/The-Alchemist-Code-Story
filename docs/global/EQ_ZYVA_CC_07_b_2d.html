<td>What a poor soul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>If you are reborn...then you should live...however you wish to live...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Such a glorious victory... Yet it's nothing more than a counterfeit, a false future. A product of my imagination, blossoming from my own rotten core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Cut down by Yauras, it was a fictional glory that I stole from her in the last moments of my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>As for the true future...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is our victory, Yauras.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I will defeat Yauras.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We won't let you lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Duh! Like hell I'm gonna lose. We're the Templars, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Do you know why I wield two swords?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Cause I haven't got any other way to surpass her grace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You don't mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If one of my blades is stopped, I've gotta immediately strike with the other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hey...what are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What are you doing? Open your eyes, idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I thought you were going to climb all the way to the top of Veda! Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Where did that person...come from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Who did it? Who killed my friend?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The Templar code for the Unforgivable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Those who harm our friends will be killed by any means necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Is this the arm you used to kill my friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ugh...! Agh! Ahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Captain Yauras!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ca-Captain Yauras...your arm?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You will never again be able to hold two swords.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Even if I am broken, I still have another sword with which to strike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Now the title of twin swordsman will belong to Sieba alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>True victory belongs to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hell...yeah. We...won.</td>

<td>Ungh...unghhh... Aaaaaaahhhh! I won! I'm m-my...my truest self. Nngh...hic... N-now I can...shine...for everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I passed on...the victory...to my friends! Uhghh...hic... S-stop crying! Aaaahhh! I...I don't care if...if I d-die here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I-I'm the world's...greatest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Th-the world's... In this monochrome world... Alone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Heheh...hahahah! This is such an unsightly way to die... It suits me so w-well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I bloomed as a weed would on the side of a road...but my petals scattered before anyone got to see them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>This is...unbearable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I can't...take it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's so frustrating, I can't...bear it!</td>

<td>N-no...this is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Sparkly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So many jewels, and...a flower?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It's so...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The world is...glittering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You've done well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What's...this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>A symbol of your independence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ahahah! You lame-o.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You're the one who tossed me aside like a piece of trash.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I told you that I'd be cheering you on from afar, did I not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Your roots were beginning to rot. It appeared that I had overwatered you. So I wanted to see if peeling away the fiction that encased you would allow your truest self to bloom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What a load of bull...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Achoo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Oho?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>No way, ah...achoo! You...achoo! Ack! Urgh! R-roses?! Achoo! You know I'm a...achoo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Don't you like them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I love themâ€”and I hate them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Are you stupid?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Besides, I also felt the need to keep my distance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What're you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That's the thing about rainbows...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You cannot see them from up close, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>So you... You've been watching over me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I have. You have shown me that which I had longed to witness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You really are a true flower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Your corrupted roots, thorny trunk, and unripe buds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>All of it has always been beautiful to me, from the very beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Huh. Hahah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>No one's ever talked to me...like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Have I not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>No one's ever taught me...a-anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Have I not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>L-let me...teach you something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Certainly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>The colors of a rainbow have a specific order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Oho? How interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>They go like this: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I...really hate the third color.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>And why is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Cause it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>It took care of me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Your sun will be there with you soon. I'll make sure of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Until then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Let us allow a flower to bloom over where you lie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Oho...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>It's raining.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>And yet the sun is shining... How curious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Can a rainbow form in the night sky, I wonder?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Ahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Lonely, aren't you? Serves you right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Aw, man... No matter how much you told me off...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I never did manage to refine my speech, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>It's totally your fault, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Cause you never minced words with me, did you?</td>
</tr>
