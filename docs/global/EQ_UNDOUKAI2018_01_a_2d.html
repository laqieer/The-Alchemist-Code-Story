<td>001</td>
<td>Hyaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hmm... Something isn't right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You're pretty spirited today, little savage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Richie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>So you're aiming to be number one in that sports thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's not just any old sports thing! It's the Phantom Skirmish Sports Festival!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm sure Leema will team up with me again if I become number one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh, right! Leema is the mechanic who makes all my mech gear, by the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I know, I know. She's your partner, right? Wait, are you two not working together anymore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ungh... Waaah! She said there's no way we can win at the Mech War Games together! She said I'm too i-impractical!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Unnghhh... How could she say such a thing after becoming a Phantom?! Leema's a demon! A beast! A... A machine freak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Jeez you're annoying... Wouldn't this be a good opportunity for you to observe the different ways in which other people operate? That's probably why Leema said such a thing to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I don't know about that, but if I become number one, then we can start over for sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Did Leema say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Leema said that for now, I have to gain more experience through battles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hmm... Come to think of it, is there prize money for this sports festival?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yeah! Leema said so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I see, so they're... Well. In any case, you should go back to practicing. This is no time to be crying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Y-yeah... You're right. Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(It's almost admirable how fast she can change gears.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It needs to be more like "Zoom!" and "Wham!" and stuff, you know? According to Reagan's Theory on Mechanical Engineering, this should go like...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmm... So you're even getting wrapped up in Reagan's Theory, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hahah! I'll do whatever it takes to win at the Mech War Games!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Also, Leema told me that most of the techniques for the Mech War Games are actually explained by Reagan's Theory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wouldn't it be better if you simply had Reagan teach you about mechanical engineering directly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wait, can I?! Richie, do you know Reagan or something?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No, I don't. He's from another time. It doesn't matter if one knows him or not, though. He's a Phantom, so if you want to ask him something, all you need to do is summon him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But I've never talked to him before! Do you think he'd be okay with teaching me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Well, it's all the same to me. Don't push yourself. Anyway, I'm going to go buy one of Elrike's lunches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(Ugh. Fine. I guess I can lend her a hand.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Elrike's lunches...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Welcome, welcome! Boxed lunches for sale!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We are honored to have won this season's Babel's Next Top Lunch! There are only ten available, so don't delay! Once they're gone, they're gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If I wanna be a winner, I need a winner's lunch! I've gotta get one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Thank you for your business!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh! Oh! Elrike! Can I have one of your lunches?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, I'm sorry! I just sold the last one. There were only enough for the first ten people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(N-no way... I didn't even make it into the top ten!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>How am I supposed to come first in the Mech War Games if I can't even buy a lunch box?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Little savage, stop whining in the middle of the street. You're blocking traffic. Here... This is for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wow! Thanks, Richie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You know, you spend far too much time dilly-dallying. That's why you miss your chance at things like buying lunch boxes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You're not much of a thinker, so why don't you try talking to someone about what's going on inside that head of yours, instead of trying to mull it all over alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>For example... Why don't you talk to Teona? She uses a lance, like you, and she's champion of the Colosseum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I think learning in an actual fight would be far more effective for someone like you than listening to lectures on theory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You're right! Richie, thank you! I'm going to go ask her right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hey, Teona! Teona...! Teona!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Whoa! Daisy? What's wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So, here's the thing! I wanna be number one, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ah, I see. I understand. (Wow. She's just as Richie described her.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Of course. What you have just described is a wall which those who aim for the top often run into. I've seen countless children at the training school hit that very wall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What should I do? I want to perfect my use of mech gear and become the best, but nothing seems to go my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I want to gallantly soar through the air, gracefully strike, and show off my lance with a bam, but even though Leema made the coolest weapon in the world for me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>No matter what I do, I just can't get it right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Now Leema's upset with me, and it's probably because I'm not making the best use of my mech gear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>All right. I have an idea. Leave it to me, Daisy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>An...idea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I came to the arena because Teona told me to, but I wonder what she has planned?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Whoa, there're so many people! Oh, wow! Even Reagan is here! I can't believe I finally get to meet him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ah, it looks like the best of the best have gathered, so... Let us begin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Begin? What do you mean, begin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yeah! You've got a lot of nerve summoning us here! Explain yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Oh, please excuse me. I got a little ahead of myself just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Ahem... Thank you all for coming here today! I have called you here for one reason, and one reason only!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>In order for us to train for the rapidly approaching Phantom Skirmish Sports Festival, I have prepared a special training exercise for you all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It's called... The Survival Race!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Survival...Race?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Let me explain. Do you seek power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Power...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Can you be more specific?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What exactly do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Teona, what are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>(Oh! I get it, now! Teona must be doing this for me!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yes, yes, yes, yes! I want power! I want to be number one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>That's the spirit! Two Teona Points for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What the heck are Teona Points? Also, why are you the one in charge?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Well, someone has to run this thing, don't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I've already had my fare share of the spotlight, so I think I'm fit to be an impartial judge. There's nothing holding me back, so to speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You're not making any darn sense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Minus Teona Points to you nit-picky people! We're past the point of no return now, just so you all know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Here, in this holy arena, with weapons in hand, you will put your very souls on the line and fight for victory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You know this isn't the arena you fought at... She's not even listening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Now, then. First, I would like to have you show off your powers for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Show off for you? How are we meant to do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Over here are some monsters, freshly caught. They've been causing trouble in the area, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Don't be shy! Punish them!</td>
</tr>
