<td>Ugh! Wh-what do you think you're doing? Hurry up and kill him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Haaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Graaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Is that all you've got? You all seem to have lost your edge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>There's no way any of you will ever succeed in executing the leader of the Desert Wings if that's the best you can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Inciting betrayal of our creed is a rather serious offense, Dahab. You will need to answer for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm impressed, Najam. I had no idea you were quite so devoted to our doctrines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But I do what I do for the sake of the order. I'm not like you; I will not dogmatically follow our creed into a hopeless future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I won't either. The creed isn't the issue here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The only thing I care about is Zalam Gaim...my home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Strict adherence to that creed is what makes us stand apart from any old gang of ne'er-do-wells. It's the one thing that's made us so strong all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So like it or not, if I'm to prevent the fall of Zalam Gaim, then I'm going to make sure that creed is honored!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Our home... You're fighting for our home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Focus, you fool! She's just trying to confuse you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>B-but, Lord Dahab—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Now is not the time to worry about following rules! I understand the Great Leader's illness has sparked great uncertainty, but that's why you need to listen to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's time we carve a new future for ourselves! We will pursue the profit we need to maintain our order. Now come! Take the first step toward a better tomorrow! Kill the mark!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh, that's rich. Do you think anyone will honestly believe that you're doing this for the order, and not for yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>H-how dare—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>An astute member of my guild discovered that you've been getting rather cozy with several Wratharis noblemen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Seems ending my life isn't just set to pay the bills, but also score you some renewed noble status of your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So if anyone gets the how-dare treatment, I'm thinking it's gonna be you. You're willing to sell yourself out—and bring Zalam Gaim down with you—in order to get what you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Urk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Dahab. Is this true? Are you merely using the trust and honor of Zalam Gaim for your own selfish ends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I see now why you'd regard our creed as a hindrance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Lord Dahab? Have you been deceiving us this whole time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Deceiving you?! Of course not! If something should happen to the order, you'd all be in dire straits. I'm merely looking out for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You're but pitiful orphans who know nothing of the world but death, and have sold your souls to a baseless creed in its name. You have nowhere else to go, so I'm leading you into a new era!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You ought to be thankful that someone like me would even give you miserable street rats the time of day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You're right about one thing, Dahab. We have nowhere else to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We're all abandoned. We're all orphans. We've escaped domination, exploitation, and even death only through the good graces of the order, and have ended countless lives in its name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The only alternative we had to dying in the streets was bloodying our hands in unquestioned servitude to our creed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This is the only place for us. One day, we will all face retribution. One day, we will succumb to death ourselves, and know first-hand the judgment we've dealt upon so many others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But for now, this is our home, and our livelihood...so Zalam Gaim must stay strong. It must survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And if we need to follow a "twisted doctrine" to ensure our survival, then so be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Eek! N-Najam! I'm sorry! I was wrong, okay? P-please—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The only equality in life is death. It is eternal and absolute. We must never forget that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>As a member of Zalam Gaim, you must submit yourself to these stringent doctrines, which include a respect for and acceptance of the sanctity and immutability of death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>If you choose to accept our creed, you must also accept the reckoning of death when it inevitably comes for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Master Ryle, will you get up already?! It's time for work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Mrrrng... Just another few minutes. I have a condition. If I don't nap, I can't move. And I've done a looooot of moving already this week.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Well, there are stacks of documents that have been on your desk since last week! What's your excuse there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I seem to recall you promising to have them finished by today, unless my memory deceives me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...Fiiiiine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I do understand your desire to sleep, though. We finally have a moment of peace! An actual end in sight to all the work we've had to do, with no further assassination attempts on the horizon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Warding off the Najam of Zalam Gaim seems to have worked like a charm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Mmm, I don't know about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Another assassin could show up before you know it, and they might be even more of a pain to deal with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Guess that would at least be a chance to see some more action, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hmm. You might be right! I should make some preparations, just to be safe. You never can be too careful, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ghanav! I've got a treat for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Heh, slow down, now. Nobody's going to take it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You've learned how to fly, but you still stick right by my side, huh? Probably a poor decision on your part.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Lady Najam, I have the next mission assignment for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Um, err...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>This client said that they wanted the job done quickly, like with Dahab.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>In accordance with our creed, I refused this request. The client was, shall we say, not pleased.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I see. Well, there's no need to worry about that. You made the right decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>We must honor the order in which our assignments are received. There are to be no exceptions to this founding tenet of Zalam Gaim.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It pleases me to hear that. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>There's the Lady Najam I know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>We all have things we can learn from you. You truly are a star.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Star... It still feels a bit off-putting to be called that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>None of that matters, though. I'll be a star if that's what I have to be to protect our home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That sounds perfect, Lady Najam!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You finished up, Ghanav? It's about time we get moving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>The star of Zalam Gaim's got some twinkling to do tonight.</td>
</tr>
