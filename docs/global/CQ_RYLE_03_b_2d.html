<td>Ryle, can I entrust this to you once more? Here is the list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Why are you relying on me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Because you are worth paying the price for. In other words, I have acknowledged your abilities. Rejoice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And what if I turned you down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I will do whatever I must to obtain these items. Money is not the only bargaining chip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well, in your case, I guess I'll accept your request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That is much appreciated. It appears you've finally acknowledged my greatness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I've never met an idiot like you before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Who are you calling an idiot?! I'm your customer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I meant that as a compliment. I no longer see you as just another rich fellow. Besides...our goals are aligned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>A wise decision. As long as you are working on my behalf, I plan to ensure that nothing ill befalls you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>After all, I will spare no effort in paying a price worthy of my desires!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Why do you go to such lengths?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>By making an effort now, I can ensure future pleasures! By completing my art collection, it will bring satisfaction to me! That satisfaction will continue on into the future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>In fact, I can introduce you to all of my personal contacts if you'd like! I'm sure it'll help in bolstering up the Guild!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What's the matter? I'm telling you that I'll honor you with my friendship. Rejoice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You really are an idiot, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Wh-what did you say?! Silence that tongue of yours! I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You are the Successor of the Sun, right? What I'm trying to tell you is that I'm actually sort of fond of idiots like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, of course! I'm still not sure how I feel about you calling me an idiot, but I can appreciate the compliment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I never said that I was complimenting you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Fuahahahah! Come now, no need to blush!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ryle, I look forward to having you continue working with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, I guess I'll put in some effort. Just enough so that I don't lose to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Right! I'll be relying on you, Ryle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well then, time for my nap. We'll talk about the details another day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huh?! You just said you were gonna put some effort into your work?! There's still a bunch of jobs I want you to take care of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I've got my own pace of handling things. Well then, go on home now. That's it for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hey! Ryle! Ack! I'll be back again soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(If I can rise in rank and earn more money, I'll be able to live an even easier life.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(Now that I've encountered this odd fellow...well, I guess I'll put a little effort into my work. Still, I'm gonna be handling things at my own pace.)</td>
