<td>What's the situation? Is there any word from Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Nothing yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What is going on down there, Kamui? At this rate, we'll be running out of ammunition soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wait, what is that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What? What do you see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Jam! Flooding out of that tree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Were all the Jam lying dormant in that tree this whole time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No, they are multiplying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Multiplying? At that ridiculous rate?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We'd need ten times the supply we originally had to deal with all the Jam!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If they continue to multiply...we'll be doomed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>When Saga was nearly overwhelmed by the Jam, they were multiplying much like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So...if the same thing is happening here as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You don't mean... Kamui failed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I don't know, but we should get away from here as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We don't have any means of standing our ground against those numbers. We need to get some distance between us while we canâ€”before they turn their attention toward us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Too late. I think they're looking this way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>P-prepare for battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Adelbert?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There's no time! If we attempt a retreat now, we'll just be engulfed from the rear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Fine! We'll have to slow them somehow with what drying agent we have left! Gather what we rationed out to the troops as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Aw man, I knew this was gonna suck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Kamui, Logi... Please be okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Agh! There's no end to this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Only deal with the ones directly in your path! Forget the others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Right!</td>
