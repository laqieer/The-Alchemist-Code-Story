<td>Good work, Ceclidis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You... Your own host!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You're wrong there, Protector. This old rot is unworthy to be my host.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Agh! Aaaaaaaaahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Behold! The majesty! The brilliance! This is Cryphone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The great vessel I have sought after for so long, housing all the curses of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You've been planning this from the beginning?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Absolutely! Everything I have done was in preparation for this very moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I instigated events so that the priestess would leave the country. She tasted freedom and gained a sense of hope, all so that I may take them away from her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Despair! That is what corrupts her to become worthy of being called Mother of the Jam!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Though it was a pain organizing these events behind Ceclidis' back...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Everything is falling into place as planned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Though I originally intended to have that boy king as the sacrifice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Heh, it must be fate that a blood relative would come charging in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You will not have your way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>O, great mother Cryphone! Awaken, and bestow upon us your eternal bounty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Eternal...bounty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What theâ€”?! They're multiplying without devouring anything?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This is bad! Logi, take Georgios! We're getting out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If we die here, everything would be for naught! Georgios needs immediate medical care!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>All right.</td>
