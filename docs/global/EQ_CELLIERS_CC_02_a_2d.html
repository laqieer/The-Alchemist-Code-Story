<td>It's about time for Mielikki to come over. The tea and cookies are all set...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh, she's here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hello there. You're Celliers, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh? Wh-who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, my apologies. I forgot to introduce myself. I am Flamel, a Court Mage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A Court Mage...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, Celliers, my adorable little laboratory rat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...What does a Court Mage want with me? I have no business with you lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What? Um, do calm down. I'm simply—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Howdy-do, Celliers! ...Oh, who is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Mielikki...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Come on, man, you can't leave a guest waiting in the entryway!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes... Yes, you're right. I should at least hear him out... Sorry, Mielikki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Eh heh heh. As long as you get it, it's cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So you are... Mielikki, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You know me, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Why yes. Your uncle, your elder sister, both Court Mages, yes? I've made their acquaintance on multiple occasions...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh, you have a sister, Mielikki? I had no idea. And he said "uncle," but you say "father"...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's right, you haven't met either of them, have you, Celliers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Pops and Sis are both Court Mages. That keeps them too busy to come see me, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Sis is amazing! And I call him Pops, but he's actually my mom's little brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Still, he raised me like his own daughter, and that's a fact!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If you're friends with Pops and Sis, you must be a good guy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Come on, you should join the two of us. I brought some tasty sweets Mom made for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hey Celliers, help me set everything out, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>S-sure, will do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(Celliers' progressed crystallization has been undone. Could it be...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...And thus, I've come to check on your condition, on Michael's behest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Is that right! That old fart's nicer than he looks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Still, why so sudden, don't you think? He said he wouldn't help too much, since I want to be self-sufficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Indeed, he did say as much. Even so, something seems to be amiss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Something's amiss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Have you observed any...suspicious characters about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Suspicious characters...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(No, that was just a customer. Wouldn't be right to cast suspicion on him outright...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...Sorry, can't really say. Customers come from all over these days, so a lot more boots cross my threshold these days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh yeah, Celliers' crystals are a huge hit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I see. A huge hit, you say...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...Is something strange about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The truth is...rumors have been circulating as of late: that Celliers' crystals have the power to remove curses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Were the tales to end there. But it seems some dubious dealings are afoot, in search of your crystals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's why Michael asked me to check in on you. If this is but a false alarm, then fine by me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Still, to plug away at your trade in a new place, only to have undue trouble hinder your efforts, well. Dreadful, if you ask me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wow, you came all this way, just for me? Th-thank you very much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ahaha, don't mention it. This is a welcome respite, one I'm more than happy to indulge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The sun is shining, the weather is warm. Unheard of back home—it snows constantly, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You don't say? We barely get any sort of snowfall here, perfect for growing flowers—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...AHHH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What?! Wha-what is it, Mielikki?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Flowers! Growing! I forgot to water my flower bed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Flower bed? You mean that sizeable patch outside?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yeah, I'd better hurry on over! Poor babies, this gorgeous weather's wasted on them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>W-wait, Mielikki, I'll come help! We'll pick this up later, Flamel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Whew... Oh thank goodness, all my darlings got the water they needed. Thanks for the assist, Celliers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Sure, I'm just glad we made it in time, and—oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Are you Celliers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Um, yes I am. And you are...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Come with us. Your crystals are required to protect us from curses.</td>
</tr>
