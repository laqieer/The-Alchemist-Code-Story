<td>001</td>
<td>Your Highness! Please, evacuate! The Greed Dike soldiers will be here any minute now...agh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Excuse me. You must be Queen Venus Lustburg, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I will not exchange words with such ill-mannered people as you. What are you doing...hurry up and eliminate them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I would've preferred to carry out matters peacefully...but it seems like you would prefer otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Our magic doesn't work on them...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Take them out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Our sole aim is that of obtaining Lustburg's Sacred Stone Asmodeus. It's not to take your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If you hand it over obediently, we've been ordered by Emperor Orion to spare your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Orion...that scum with his cheeky words! Die! You ingrates!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You uncouth fools! I must teach you the price of your undiscerning words...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Honestly, you still don't get it, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Restrain her. Do not kill her until she's given up the location of Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>My magic doesn't work...?! Is this some kind of special magic defense?! In that case...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What are all these insects...?! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hmph. These is plenty of Alchemia within these creatures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>With them, you stand no chance against me, you Greed Dike scum...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ill Atmosphere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>They froze...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So you're willing to sacrifice your men in order to obtain power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's not a good move, Your Highness. You're supposed to be protecting your people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>More importantly...since a state of emergency has been declared...it's our job to intercept Greed Dike on your behalf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You're that Paladin from the Holy Guard...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Whoa! H-h-hey, hold on! Please, don't strip me naked again! Just for today, can we remove the ban on men?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Your name was Othima, wasn't it? Why do only your abilities work on them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh, no...actually, to be honest, it's not working.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I just froze their magic defenses along with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But...that's odd...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Odd...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes. I've never seen such complete protection before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I mean, no matter what kind of defense method is used, it should inflict at least some level of damage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's true. I've never encountered someone who my magic didn't work on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Plus, these aren't even prototypes. They're just regular soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Does it mean that someone armed them with magic defenses?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Your calm judgment...and your outstanding magic abilities...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I am deeply impressed, Captain Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Behind...?! Agh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Who are you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I am one of the Veda Templars...Acht, the 7 Tactics Master.. Thus, my allegiances lie with Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The Veda Templars...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You are the one who equipped those scum with magic defenses?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>If magic won't work on you...then I'll hack you to death instead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...Gauntlet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>An artificial arm...?! Not good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ack...! What kind of attack is this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>No! Please stand back and leave this to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Don't get in my way! I must use them as fuel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Right. You are attempting to use their Alchemia to your advantage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Radiator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...! She's going to burn them all! Run!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>My men...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ack! Ill Atmosphere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You froze all the bugs?! You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'm sorry, that's the best I could do. Please heal them properly later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Oh dear. Since she switches her artificial arm, her attack style keeps changing as well. I can't grasp a pattern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>That being said, you said something that drew my interest just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Veda...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Like you've observed...I am from Lost Blue...just like you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
