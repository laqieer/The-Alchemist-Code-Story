<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Was that all there was to a wretched life like hers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yeah, you do that. We've been running for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ain't nothing we can hide behind in these flat plains, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Keep your eyes peeled, kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And here I thought it was going to be two familiar troublemakers...</td>

<td>Wait.</td>

<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What happened back there? Why wasn't I informed?</td>

<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You're next on the list, Godslayer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If you don't want your punishment to be more severe than it already is, you'd do well to stay out of the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Even if you were to kill her on the spot, what's gonna happen to the sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>How would you know if it would go inert? Berith's pretty attached to Red.</td>

<td>Grr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>No. No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Erasing my identity and forcing me to live a life I have no control over...how is that living?</td>

<td>All for some strange goal we are never told about...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
