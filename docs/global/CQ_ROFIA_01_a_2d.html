<td>Do you have some time to spare, Court Mage Lofia?</td>

<td>...What do you want?</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>An old man like me is out of touch with todayâ€™s pop culture you young folks like!</td>

<td>I see. I'm busy right now.</td>

<tr>

<td>Oh, you really are adorable, Lady Lofia. You look just like my granddaughter.</td>

<td>Although from your maturity, I think my granddaughter is somewhat more mature than you, in her way of thinking...</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hohoh. Don't worry too much about it. You still haven't hit the full extent of puberty yet.</td>

<td>Would you please shut up and leave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wow. Despite my age, I feel crushed.</td>

<td>All I wanted to do was take some tea with you, Lady Lofia.</td>

<td>As you can see, I also have souvenirs.</td>

<td>That thing that Michael just pulled from his breast pocket...that sweet scent...it's a muffin!</td>

<td>Do you like sweets?</td>

<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I don't think many people hate them.</td>

<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(Ohh...it smells so delicious.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Sweets have the effect of stimulating brain activity.</td>

<td>Well, what a perfect amount of sweetness. I can feel my brain already becoming stimulated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>(Ack! He's making fun of me on purpose! What a mean old man!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, actually I have more. Would you like some?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I don't want something you pulled out of your breast pocket that probably stinks like an old man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh...well, that's highly unfortunate. After all, I went out of my way to purchase them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Bad news, Lady Lofia and Lord Michael! The enemy have surrounded our special forces!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Understood. I'll go immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Seriously, they're a bunch of ruffians. Let's quickly finish them off and have tea.</td>
