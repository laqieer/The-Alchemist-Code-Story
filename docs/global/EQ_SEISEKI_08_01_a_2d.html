<td>In other words...you're saying that it's not just Envylia and Lustburg...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You believe that Greed Dike's power now spans to other countries as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes. Most likely, this invasion is only the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I believe that eventually, all of Babel will be thrust into an unprecedented state, the likes of which we've never seen before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That being said, we still haven't received a formal rescue request from either Envylia or Lustburg, have we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Isn't there a chance that it could all be a hoax? It's hard to imagine even Greed Dike making such drastic moves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No...I think there's plenty of chance it's true. Lion Monarch Orion is a pretty messed up guy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I doubt he thinks much of turning the entire world against him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I agree. When Kudan was alive, there was something he told me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Orion's actions stem from the number one priority of obtaining the Alchemy Source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I don't think he pays much attention to how the other countries take action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If we continue to wait for a messenger from Envylia or Lustburg to arrive, we'll lose the upper hand. It'll be more efficient to take action now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes. Once things are set into action, it'll be difficult for us to meet like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's important that we gather together and make sure that we are all on the same page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hmph...I think you're overthinking this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We the 2nd Regiment will go and see what is happening in Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No matter what ambitions Greed Dike may be harboring, we'll scatter them before they have a chance to fester.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh? You're planning on going with just the 2nd Regiment?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Please, wait! We still haven't determined the extent of their power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Besides...I've heard rumors that Greed Dike has succeeded in the development of immortal soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I've heard this as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>However...if rumors of Greed Dike's invasion are in fact true, then even now Envylia is in danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The thought of Dilga and our other allies engaged in a desperate struggle at this very moment makes me uneasy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It'll be all right. Once the formal rescue request arrives, we the 1st Regiment will immediately deploy as well. Will that be all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>As I was thinking of fortifying the protection of Northern Pride with myself and Seida while you, Captain Yauras, would command the mobile troops...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Very well. Captain Monzein, please lead an expedition to Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Understood. Greed Dike...we'll show you what happens when you underestimate the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Um... Can I have a word with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm assuming we'll get pretty busy, so I thought I'd ask you now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Last time we went drinking together, I won, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>About that meal you owe me...when are you gonna pay up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh? What're you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>A bet...?! Seriously, you two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>N-no! It's not a big deal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It was just a cute little wager about guessing the gender of the next customer to walk in...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What are you talking about? Why would you make up something like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huh?! Hey, hold on a second! Are you gonna talk your way out of it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Stop speaking nonsense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Why would I bet on something as silly as that?! Gambling goes against the code of chivalry! I would never do anything like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ah, there you go again! You were drunk out of your mind, so I had a bad feeling about it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Don't you think not fessing up to it and admitting defeat goes more against the code of chivalry?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What's this...? Stop arguing about such petty things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...It's highly inefficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>H-hey, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What's with all the condescending looks? For starters, I'm not the one who...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Enough! Do you understand what our current situation is?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Agh...sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Seriously...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Monzein...be careful not to let your code of chivalry sweep you off your own feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huh?! Yauras...are you gonna ridicule my way of thinking too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>No, that's not it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What I'm saying is that Greed Dike is the kind of country that will use every dirty trick in the book in order to obtain their ends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Your straightforward honesty is sometimes easy to read...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I'm telling you to make sure your code of chivalry doesn't work against you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>So are you telling me to be deviant instead?! You gotta be kidding me! Using dirty means would be the same thing as abandoning my knight's honor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Honestly! You really should try to listen to advice sometimes! If you end up messing up your priorities in order to fulfill your personal agenda...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That's nonsense! I've always put the Holy Guard...and the future of this world first and above everything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Your useless worrying is unnecessary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>It's pointless now. Once he gets started, he won't listen to reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Sigh... I understand why you're tempted to use the term "inefficient."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>In any case, once an official request for support has been made, we'll send back up immediately. Please don't take too many risks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Don't make me say it again. Your worrying is unnecessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>We're racing against the clock now. There's no time to lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Don't worry about it, Kanon. Who do you think I am? Trust the Great Thunder Axe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Once we get back, I'm gonna need some of your time. I've got to properly teach you about the code of chivalry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Agh... You always have to be on the winning side, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Excuse me! I've received word that a messenger from Envylia has arrived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Welcome them and bring them here immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>What about the food supplies for the Lustburg expedition troops?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>It's been taken care of! Commander Kanon wants a word with us! Hurry to the square!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I know, I know! Curse you, Greed Dike... Are you gonna turn the whole world against you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Northern Pride - Main room of the Holy Guard headquarters</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>We've received an official request for support from Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Kagura...I'll leave them to you and Captain Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Unfortunately, it looks like it wasn't just a hoax. But...considering how you look at it, this might be a good opportunity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>A good opportunity...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>If they hadn't instigated all of this, Kudan wouldn't have died. It's a good chance to get our revenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>No. I understand how you feel, but if we retaliate in bitterness, it will only serve to fuel the cycle of hatred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>............</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>This invasion will inevitably spread through the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>If we don't stop it, there will be no future for any of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Also, in order to prevent creating another Captain Kudan, we must stem those feelings now, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Hehe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Huh...? What's so funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Seriously...somewhere along the way you really did turn into the Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>What are you talking about? Look at yourself, Kagura. You're the Captain of the 5th Regiment that can make any army turn tail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Who would've thought a day would come when we would lead the Holy Guard...I mean, you're still the same airhead that I first met at school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>...Likewise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Kanon...other than those from the 2nd Regiment, all of the members have been gathered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I'm sure all of you have heard already, but Greed Dike led by the Lion Monarch Orion have made their way to Envylia and the neighboring country of Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>There they have begun a large-scale assault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Until now, there has never been a large conflict between Greed Dike and those two countries...this is a one-sided invasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Those from Greed Dike have yet to issue any formal statement. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>As the suzerain country, Northern Pride has proclaimed this an act of aggression.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>The act has been officially named the Lion Monarch's Charge and a formal state of emergency has been declared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Following these orders...we of the Holy Guard have been ordained to quell this Lion Monarch's Charge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Most likely, this invasion is only just the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I believe that Greed Dike's invasion will expand to include Slothstein, Wratharis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>And ultimately Northern Pride as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>We must do everything we can to stop it before it reaches that point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>As we still suffer damage from the previous Wadatsumi expedition, we are still not at our full strength yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>However, we have survived and overcome such severe situations before. We find strength in the justice that we believe in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I believe that we can shatter the baseless ambitions of Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>True justice is with us! We hold the light that leads to the future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>We, the Holy Guard, must shatter the biggest plot in all of history to rob us of our freedom...we must lead the people to a peaceful future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Lion Monarch Orion...I refuse to let you do as you please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Meanwhile...in the Greed Dike royal castle Dynam Dionysus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>We've received a report from our scouts. Having received a declaration of a state of emergency, the Holy Guard are finally on the move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Oh dear...the "absolute justice" really does seem to be taking its time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Honestly, it's quite deplorable. Please leave it to me regarding their movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I've already arranged to receive reports regarding each individual captain's movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>There's no need to pay attention to all of the Holy Guard. What we need to focus on is Captain Kagura of the 5th Regiment...and, more than anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Captain Seida from the 3rd Regiment, correct? Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Hmph... Did you receive word from the Templars?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>No, I haven't yet. Honestly...what are they doing...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Never mind. They'll show up eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>More importantly, Waginau...I would like a little of your wisdom. I just can't seem to suppress this blood that rages on the verge of madness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Please don't worry about that either. The moment we have long awaited will soon be upon us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Heheh! The time has come! Now is the time that we obtain the power to shake the laws of this world!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Somewhere in this world - Hideout of the Veda Templars</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>We've received word that Vier has arrived in Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Acht will also soon arrive in Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Tsk. Hey, when are we gonna get to move?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>At this rate, my body is gonna grow lax. Hurry up and let us be deployed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Our leader bases decisions on various factors. It would be wise not to make careless remarks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Huh? Füry...are you gonna talk back to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>...Stop it, Neun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Shut up! Are you making fun of me, eh? I'll give you a good wallop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>I said stop it. Or...do you want me to blow your head off?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I-idiot...it was just a joke! Don't get all worked up...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>A joke? I see...my apologies then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>More importantly, Neun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>"The goddess frowns on those who cannot eat the scraps that a dog will not." Do you understand the meaning of that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Huh...? That we should value food?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>No, idiot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>It means that sometimes we need to do the dirty work in order to reach our goals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>It may be annoying to do what Orion demands, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Endure it for now. If we overcome this mountain, it'll be advantageous for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>After we handle this situation, we'll be one large step closer to fulfilling our long-cherished wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>You don't have to say anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>As our leader, none of us question your wisdom. We just do what you tell us to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Heh. All right then, let's go. It's time we found our own "sky" in this Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>The Emperor Orion of Greed Dike commences a simultaneous attack on both Envylia and Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Regarding this as an act of aggression on a scale not seen since the devastation of Wadatsumi, Northern Pride announces a state of emergency.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Upon receiving this declaration, Kanon and the other Paladins advance to engage in battle on the very same day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>However, little do they know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Behind this catalytic incidence lurks the strong will of one man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Even this assault that will cause the entire world to quiver...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>It is nothing more than a small glimpse of the earnest plan this man has spun throughout an eternity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>This will later be told down through the ages as the largest threat ever to have arisen in the continent of Babel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>This is the memory of the mad monarch bearing the name Lion. And of the great war he begun that would overturn the laws of this world.</td>

<td>163</td>
<td>THE ALCHEMIST CODE</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Sacred Stone Memories -Lion Monarch's Charge-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>The Lustburg expedition has completed its preparations. We will head out soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Hm? Oh, right. All right then, let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>...? You don't seem to be in good spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>No, it's nothing. I'm just a little upset about how unreasonably Greed Dike is behaving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>It's all right. This is an emergency situation. I'm sure they'll accept it without any problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>You're worried about being captured again, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Don't worry. Lustburg is in no position right now to behave like they did then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Captured...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Hey...! Hey wait, Captain Yauras! Don't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>It's an old story. This guy was once mistaken for an intruder. He was restrained and stripped naked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Naked...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Agh...seriously...why do women always say everything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Did you say something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>N-no! I mean, who would've thought they'd restrain a captain of the Holy Guard?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>On top of that, I was actually born in Lustburg, you know? Although I was abandoned at a pretty young age...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Since Lustburg suffers from the Asmodeus Curse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>It's quite normal for them to discard newly born boys, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Yeah. It's a hard country to live in as a man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>In any case...Captain Othima, I think that you're most qualified to lead the rescue mission to Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Kagura will go along with you so you've nothing to worry about. If something happens, please handle it, Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Yes, leave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>No way! So I'm pretty much just dead weight?! That's a little harsh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Stop nitpicking. Seriously...why don't you at least try to be a little more responsible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Your little act of declaring war on Greed Dike might be what spurred them into action, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>...Umm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Declared war...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>N-no...! There's no way something I said would've caused...um...sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>I'm not sure of all the facts...but the Lion Monarch Orion engaged in dialogue with Captain Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>It's believed that his talk regarding the "balance of world power" is what brought about all of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>So you think he is after the Sacred Stones within each country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Yes. As well as what many refer to as the eighth Sacred Stone, Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>I'm not really sure of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>During our previous Wadatsumi expedition...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>I used my Kagutsuchi to seal the Mikaboshi to the point that it was on the verge of losing its power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>In its current state, the Mikaboshi is pretty much nothing more than a rock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>We'd be well aware of its existence long before Greed Dike finds it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Right...you have a point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Have we received any word from the Saga region...or Gluttony Foss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>Huh? Right now, we haven't heard anything that amounts to an invasion by Greed Dike, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Is there something that worries you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>If the purpose of Greed Dike's invasion is to destroy the balance of power in the world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>There's a chance they would head to the Saga region...that's if they've picked up on information on a certain matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Of course. With that possibility in mind, I've already dispatched troops to the area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>But, Seida, you have Gluttony Foss' Sacred Stone stored within the Holy Guard, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Kanon. After that fact was revealed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>When we returned from the Wind Temple, I immediately changed the hiding place of the Sacred Stone Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Huh...?! Then you don't have it with you right now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Don't think badly of me. It wasn't that I didn't trust you or Captain Monzein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>I just thought it best to be cautious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>No...of course. That was a wise decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>In other words...there's a chance that Greed Dike may target its location then?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>No...that's not possible. I haven't told the location of Beelzebub to anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Greed Dike is one thing, but not even the people of Gluttony Foss know its location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>Hmm. I don't seem to understand what the problem is then if Beelzebub is stored somewhere no one knows about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>In other words...even if Greed Dike were to attack the Saga region, there's zero chance they'd obtain the Sacred Stone there, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Do you mean you're worried about Saga's safety? But...if that's the case, it's not just Saga. All countries are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>No, that's not it. If Greed Dike were to uncover information regarding Matter, it'll be very problematic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>If they believe that the key to destroying the balance of power in the world is to seize something that harbors a vast amount of Alchemy energy, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>I'm certain that they'll head to the Saga region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>Matter...? What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>It's a type of Philosopher's Stone that the local Saga tribes refer to as the Crystal Quartet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>These are four holy crystals that harbor the natural elemental spirits of fire, water, wind, and earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>Currently, they are being preserved by the shamans of each tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>Do you mean it’s a subspecies of the Philosopher's Stones? Do you think that Greed Dike will go after them?</td>
</tr>

<td>However...if you bring these four crystals together and their elements are combined...</td>

<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>It will invoke a large amount of Alchemy energy that will be enough to control Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>If it's that important...why didn't you say something about it earlier?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>I'm sorry. As long as Lord Waginau, who has connections with Greed Dike, is present in the council...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>I don't know who or where someone might be eavesdropping. I couldn't confide in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>Well, that makes sense, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>How publically is the existence of this Matter known?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240</td>
<td>I believe that most of the general public are unaware of its existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>241</td>
<td>But the people of the tribes...most would be aware of it as a piece of lore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>242</td>
<td>With each of the tribes feuding against each other and its high potential for warfare...I doubt it will be even possible to get them all in the same place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>243</td>
<td>But if Greed Dike were to hear about this information...perhaps it would best for Seida to head to the Saga region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>244</td>
<td>No. If we did that, it would thin out our defenses in Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>245</td>
<td>Right now, we can't afford to be without your vast capabilities of detection, Seida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>246</td>
<td>Right...I'm sorry. It'll be okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>247</td>
<td>Even the likes of Greed Dike shouldn't be able to easily seize the four Matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>248</td>
<td>We should still be able to make it on time if we detect movement in the Saga region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>249</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>250</td>
<td>Besides...when I confided in everyone that the Sacred Stone Beelzebub was with the Holy Guard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>251</td>
<td>Waginau and Orion were in the Wind Temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>252</td>
<td>If they had heard our discussion...I'm sure Greed Dike will come after me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>253</td>
<td>If that's the case, then it would be most efficient if we strengthen our army in Northern Pride and intercept there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>254</td>
<td>Yes...understood. We'll consider dispatching new reinforcements to the Saga region as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>255</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Seida. You go protect Northern Pride as planned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>256</td>
<td>Understood. Sorry for confusing matters at the last minute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>257</td>
<td>No. I'm glad I was able to hear about the existence of Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>258</td>
<td>Well then, Captain Othima...head with Kagura to Lustburg and, if anything occurs there, we'll send reinforcements immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>259</td>
<td>No...more than us, shouldn't you be worrying about Envylia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>260</td>
<td>Are you worried about Monzein? Don't be. I'm going to be heading there myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>261</td>
<td>Please don't worry. For now, I've had Basheeny accompany Monzein to report on matters, just in case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>262</td>
<td>Yeah, about that...you know...he used to be a spy for Greed Dike, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>263</td>
<td>Seriously? Are you still gonna suspect him? Can't you see that he's had a complete change of heart?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>264</td>
<td>Don't worry. In his current state, it doesn't seem likely that he's being dishonest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>265</td>
<td>Besides...as an ex-spy, he should know Greed Dike's behavior better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>266</td>
<td>I recommended him as the perfect resource for this matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>267</td>
<td>No, that's not what I mean. I'm talking about old man Monzein, who hates things that aren't straightforward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>268</td>
<td>I was just wondering if him and Basheeny might have a falling out or something...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>269</td>
<td>You don't need to worry about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>270</td>
<td>I've told him that the reason why Basheeny went off about being an assassin for Lord Waginau was due to the effect of the volcanic gas coming from Ramproad Mountain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>271</td>
<td>Huh? Are you serious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>272</td>
<td>What do you mean...of course I'm serious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>273</td>
<td>If I hadn't done that...there's no way I'd let the two of them travel together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>274</td>
<td>W-wait, hold on a second... Are you telling me that Monzein, a full-grown adult, can't actually accept the truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>275</td>
<td>It's because he can't accept it that all of us have been going out of our way to trick him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>276</td>
<td>B-but...no, that can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>277</td>
<td>What's the matter? You look pale...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>278</td>
<td>Well, I...when he was leaving...I reminded Monzein that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>279</td>
<td>He should forget about his past as a spy and learn to get along with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>280</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
