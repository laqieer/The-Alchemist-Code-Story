<td>001</td>
<td>The decorations are coming along nicely. I can't wait to see how they turn out this year! Isn't this exciting, Mei Fang?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes... I am pleased to see that they are as resplendent as ever. The vivid orange pairs well with the black accents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wow! Look! They've already put up the jack-o'-lanterns! They're so spooky and cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>All right! Halloween is here, baby! 'Tis the season to party!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What the—?! Watch where you're going, kid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry, m-mister...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hold it. You're the one who bumped into the kid. Why aren't you apologizing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh? I didn't do anything! Kids shouldn't be wandering around like that, anyway. Oughta be kept on a tight leash...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh? If you refuse to apologize for your carelessness, that would make you a very bad boy. Before you know it, you'll be the one leashed...and I promise you, you'll learn your manners at my heel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Aaahh! I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean anything by it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hmph... What the hell was his problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>He will not be the only one. There are many who would use the merrymaking of this occasion as an excuse to commit all manner of misdemeanors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Such as picking pockets. Apparently cutpurses are on the rise, so we have been drafted to patrol the area and keep an eye out for any miscreants. Really, they are asking a bit much of us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I see. Looks like we've been saddled with a lot of responsibility this time around, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ohh, how wonderful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>How whimsical and mystical the world of Halloween! Today is my day. This event was made for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The decorations are exquisite. I see we are sticking to our roots with the tried-and-true hues of orange and black. Magnificent! Of course, nothing can beat the combination of red and black, so there is still room for improvement...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Uh... Maybe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Why, there's no question! The jack-o'-lanterns would be so much more fetching in red. Yes, they would look so much sweeter in blood red...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Now, as for the candy... Of course, candy apples are a must! That deep-red luster is to die for! Heehee...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What is the meaning of this? That little imp is going around swapping all of the orange decorations for red ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Should she be doing that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Of course not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Rosa! That's quite enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Halloween is not yours alone to enjoy. Changing the decorations to suit your tastes is simply inexcusable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Goodness... Everyone seems to think that they can just do whatever they please today, but they are sorely mistaken!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What's the matter with you? You seem rather out of sorts, Inquisitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And why wouldn't I be? Have you seen the state of people's morals as of late? Absolutely deplorable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Thanks to those grown men and women who would take advantage of the Halloween Carnival and its theme of trickery to behave poorly, I am forced to be constantly on edge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>And yet I find a troublemaker exists among even those who have been tasked with patrolling and maintaining the peace! Unbelievable... I cannot afford to let down my guard for even a second!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well! I get called troublemaker before I even get a hello? Hmph! I was just trying to make Halloween even more wonderful than it is now. Is that such a crime?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Perhaps not, but it certainly makes you a troublemaker! I was entrusted with patrol duty to ensure that the standards of this occasion are upheld! Do you understand me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The Halloween colors are orange and black. A red-and-black Halloween cannot be allowed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Orange reminds us of the fall harvest, of the warmth of the sun's rays, and of the fire crackling in the hearth. It has a real and pertinent meaning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Being locked into stereotypes like that is dead boring!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Your preferences are entirely irrelevant! We are here to patrol, first and foremost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Pfft. If fire is so important, then why not red? Fire is way closer to red than orange!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hmph. I will not argue for argument's sake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Why don't the both of you calm down? You two are causing a scene. If your intention was to create a spectacle, then you are doing an excellent job of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh, my... My apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Naw, don't worry about it. It's great that you're so passionate about the job!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>So... Looks like it's the four of us on patrol this year, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We're not just here to patrol. We've gotta hand out candy to all the kids, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I see that you are well-informed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Of course I am! I double-checked the job description and prepared everything I would need today well ahead of time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Neica handed out the candy last time, right? Well, I've brought something even better than her magical treats! Heehee...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Really? That's great! Looks like we can leave the candy to Rosa and get on with the patrol, ladies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Indeed. Do as you wish. I do not enjoy entertaining children, so if someone else is willing to take the job, they have my blessing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Fine by me. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and get—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Wait just a moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You aren't intending to hand out that concoction of yours, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Concoction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>According to Magnus, you've been working on creating a very suspicious-looking concoction since you were assigned to this team.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>A concoction?! What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Well, there have been some weird dark-red fumes coming from Rosa's room. She was meant to be making candy, but...it sure didn't smell like she was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Mia and Hayate got suspicious enough to sneak a peek and found Rosa in some kind of ecstatic trance, brewing this...concoction. Seems to be some kind of super-secret tincture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Those two are really looking forward to Halloween, so I thought I should let you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I-I appreciate that, I do, but...what in the world could Rosa be planning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Who knows? I sure don't, but apparently Elizabeth has something to do with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>E-Elizabeth?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Halloween always means some kinda trouble and almost all of it is caused by somebody. If that somebody is Elizabeth, you're in for a hell of a ride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Nothin'. Nothin' at all. Don't really wanna remind myself of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Anyway, Rosa is planning something. That much is clear. Best keep your eyes peeled and your guard up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Well, if you're gonna be there, I suppose there's nothing to worry about. Nothing bad can happen with a fine woman like yourself on guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>F-fine woman?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Wh-why would you say something so frivolous in the middle of a serious discussion about work? Really!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Was I being too forward?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>N-no, not at all! I will not penalize you for that nonsensical statement, but—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Ahem...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Very well. I accept your request as reasonable and just.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Glad to hear it, but don't do it for me. Do it for all the little kiddies who're looking forward to Halloween.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>('Cause if someone doesn't take care of this, you can bet Mia is gonna volunteer the rest of us to go help out. No thank you.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Be at ease. So long as I am there, those who would disrupt order will be dealt with swiftly and harshly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Still, something will probably happen regardless of what you do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>After all, Halloween is full of surprises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Huh. So that's the deal, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>All this talk of concoctions and tinctures is giving me a headache. Do you have something to say for yourself, imp?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Rosa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Ohh... Are you talking about what I think you're talking about? Because if you are, you don't need to worry about it anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What do you mean, anymore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Numyua!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Aahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Naw, it's you guys! Did you come back to spend Halloween with us this year too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Wh-why are you speaking to them with such fondness?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Numu...numu, numu, numyua!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>They appear to want something, but I haven't the faintest idea what that might be. Do you have any inkling, Melda?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Nope. They're way too excited. I can't make out a word of what they're saying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Oh, well... Guess we'll have to wait until they've calmed down a little bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Numa, numu, numaa!</td>
</tr>
