<td>Waaah! I'm so hungry now after fighting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's no use crying! I'm hungry as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Sob... Hm? Oh...look! There's fruit growing on that tree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're right...but it's too high. Sigh... Maybe I should've asked someone bigger to come with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wh-what did you say?! Fine! I'm good at tree climbing, but I'm not gonna give you any, Hazuki!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hey! Wait! That tree...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Eeek! Owwww!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This forest is humid so it's easy to slip... You never listen to what anyone tells you. Of course, you're gonna end up hurting yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ohh...sob...hic...sob...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Sigh... Fine. I'll be on the bottom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You can ride on my shoulders. Come on, stand up... Uff...ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Whooaa...! Ack... A little more to the right...yeah! I got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...Just one?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's all there was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Sigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Um, you know...Hazuki... We can...half it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I wouldn't have been able to get it if it weren't for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>O-okay... Thank you, Rin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No...it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Also...I'm sorry about just now... I was too harsh on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No... I'm sorry, as well. I'm always blaming others and not listening to what they say...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I guess we're both to blame. I also said unnecessary things about your size and blamed you for everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We're pretty similar, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah. Let's eat while we walk. I'm sure we'll be able to get back soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Gurraahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Eeek! Not again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Le-let's run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Waaah! It's so persistent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huff...huff! For now, let's just run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huff...huff... The monster...it's not coming! It...it seems to have...given up...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...So beautiful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huh? ...Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's so vast! I've never seen this place before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Woohooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Seriously? After all that running, you can still run?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hazuki! Hurry, hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hey...hold on! It's dangerous to run off like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh...that's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(Right...Hazuki has always worried about me when I've done dangerous things. That's why I can play without a care in the world when I'm with her!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(I've always taken that for granted, but it's actually something I should be really grateful about.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(I'm sure we'll end up fighting again, Hazuki...but, please, always stay my friend.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...Hm? Oh? Here! This place! I saw the tanuki boy around here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Huh?! But, but there's no shrine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huh? That's weird...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Maybe you mistook something else for it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It can't be! See, look at those leaves on the ground. Those are the ones that tanukis often use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Leaves...? Rin, you're a fox, right? But maybe...just maybe you were outsmarted by a tanuki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That shrine you saw, maybe it was just an illusion that the tanuki boy tricked you into seeing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What?! No way! Seriously...Hazuki, you idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Eheheh! Over here! Catch me if you can!</td>
