<td>Ack, this woman is stronger than she looks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>She's the former reigning champion of the Arena! We can't face her directly, we have to come together andâ€”bfnh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Teona, over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Kamui?! Th-thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>She has allies?! Where are our reinforcements?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I think we've come far enough to lose our pursuers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Kamui... Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It was nothing. More importantly, what are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I heard that General Ceclidis had come to the South. I came here to see it for my own eyes, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Well, you saw what happened. I was able to see what I needed, but then they found me out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Erm, I don't mean to speak so frankly to a stranger, but...I don't think you're really suited to this kind of work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, I agree, but...Waginau was quite insistent. He said that there was a reason it had to be me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Are you sure he didn't just plant you here as a distraction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A distraction? No... Could it be? Wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wait, who are you? Kamui, who is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>A friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>My name is Isidore. It is a pleasure to meet the first champion of the Royal Arena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh! You know me! Please, call me Teona.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>However, for you to be here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. General Leordas is nearby, preparing for battle in one of our bases.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Waginau took off on his own recently, but he has lent us the support of several Paladins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>In other words, this place is to become a battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's not set in stone or anything, but...the possibility of that is pretty high.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>In preparation, we have been secretly evacuating the nearby villages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Miss Teona! Are you alright?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Y-yes! I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Excuse me, I must return to our main forces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yikes. Seems like things are about to get fired up. Kamui, I have another favor to ask of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No need to ask. I will go to the Chief immediately and let him know what is happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Please. I will go to the warriors and make sure they are all on the alert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Chief, there is a matter which I believe requires your attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Kamui? Come on in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Thank you, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What is this? You're out of breath. What in the world is happening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That is what I am here to tell you about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>So the soldiers of both the North and the South are probing the area around the village, you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Our mirage barrier still stands strong, so I believe they have not yet discovered the village, but...I do not understand their actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Last night, one of our wise women received a prophecy from the great Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>From Sephiron? What kind of prophecy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That the Sacred Stone shall make this world its stage again within the next twenty-five years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>How could that be? Despite the alliance of the seven kingdoms? What could cause someone to break the alliance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You must know already that the shadows for what is to come have been born during these days of "peace" under King Narol's rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes. After all, the effects of the war have reached even our little hidden village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I have even heard reports of drought and deforestation, and even plague outside of the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>If the King were to die at this critical time, it is not unlikely that the next ruler would be willing to defy convention and natural law to gather power and influence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The Sacred Stones are symbols of the righteous kings of this land. It is easy to see how someone might think Beelzebub will grant them the power of a king, and release its curse upon this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ultimately, the result will be the same, whoever releases the curse. Beelzebub's gluttonous power will overrun this country again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>We must prepare for its arrival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yes. It seems that the time we have left to prepare you as the Protector grows ever shorter. That must be our priority now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We will verify the purpose of the Royal Army here in these lands with King Narol. Go tell Isidore of this as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(For a wise woman to receive ill omens about the strange movements of the armies of Gluttony...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What in the world is about to happen...?</td>
</tr>
