<td>If the King were to die at this critical time, it is not unlikely that the next ruler would be willing to defy convention and natural law to gather power and influence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iakov</td>
<td>The Sacred Stones are symbols of the righteous kings of this land. It is easy to see how someone might think Beelzebub will grant them the power of a king, and release its curse upon this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iakov</td>
<td>Ultimately, the result will be the same, whoever releases the curse. Beelzebub's gluttonous power will overrun this country again.</td>
</tr>

<td>We must prepare for its arrival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
