<td>Not good! Liz is being pushed back, even after she was able to overpower the queen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The combination of those witches and the vermin...in some ways it's more dangerous than the queen. It's so hard to predict how they'll attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Where did the vermin even come from?! I thought most of the insects flew off to the city or the sky...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The simple answer is that these were made just for the witches!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Y-you made them?!</td>

<td>From the sap we collected from the Second Babel, we gave it to the men who had become insects. That's all there is to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Collected? Wasn't the Second Babel burnt down?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What do you mean you fed them the sap? Where did you get the insects from in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't want to say it. Just thinking about it makes my skin crawl!</td>

<td>I see...</td>

<td>You extracted the magic from the men with the Succubus Ritual and then you placed the Asmodeus curse on them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Your reasons aside, that was a real nasty move on your part.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...! You loudmouth brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What is the Succubus Ritual?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What do you mean by nasty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh?! Oh, ah, nothing...! Anyway, we've got more important things to handle!</td>
