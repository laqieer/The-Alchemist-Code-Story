<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Wow, you fixed our ship!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I also fixed the Alkaroids since you went to the trouble of picking them up. Use them conscientiously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Thank you! Thank you so much! With this, we can return to the high seas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You really fixed it! It's like a dream! Thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You're welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ohhh! Amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You fixed it! They look so happy. That's our Albea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're right, they do look really happy. They really treasure that boat... I'm glad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(I might've focused too much on becoming a sister my brother can be proud of.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(I thought that if I became a Phantom Soldier I'd be able to see him and I lost sight of what was important.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It doesn't matter what it means to anyone else... As long as I'm happy, that's all that matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And seeing the happy faces of my customers makes me happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I think I understand a little how you feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I sometimes compare myself to Nyx.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Occasionally but not that often! I'm happy with myself, so I don't really care!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Besides, Magnus wants you to live your days smiling happily, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So I'm sure it's fine that you're having fun living your life as a mechanic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You think so? But then maybe I'm really not able to fulfill his wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I rarely smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Uh, you did, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>When the pirates smiled and thanked you, you gave such a blindingly happy smile! I wanted to show it to Magnus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Albea, stick out your hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>My comb! Where did you find it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I spotted when the octopuses were gathering. I thought they might have it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Just like you said, it glowed when I shined a light on it in the dark of the cave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It was really beautiful! Magnus has got some taste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Maybe, but... He doesn't come see me in person. He just leaves things like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Things like this? I'm sure Magnus has his reasons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Maybe he's just aiming to do things that will make you smile. Something certain, like pushing a button to get the right result.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh, looks like the ship repairs are finished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yup! How are things over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Um... The octopus situation got sorted out, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, it's still covered in garbage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We had our hands so full with the octopuses that we didn't get around to cleaning up the garbage they brought out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Haaa... Just looking at it makes my head hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But we'll be fine. We've got more than enough people to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>True. Since they caused all this mess, they'll help clean it up, won't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>A-aye! Leave it to us! Er... Although, that is a crazy amount of trash.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yeah... I feel a little faint... Sorting it is going to be very troublesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Well, the Alkaroids can help out too, so it won't take that much time. See, look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Cleaning protocols initiated. Alcohol bottle, recyclable. Fake treasure map, burnable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Cooperation will increase the probability of finishing this cleaning project by sunset to 65%. Recommendation: cease all useless chatter and begin cleaning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>A-aye aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Well, let's leave the cleaning to them...and start playing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What? Is that all right? We are still supposed to be on the clock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It'll be fine. The Alkaroid problem has been solved, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Noah, let's eat some shaved ice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's covered in fruit. It looks so good! But that's not the most important thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It's very cute, so I want you to see it as soon as possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Those two...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hehe... Your face is loosening up, Noah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ohh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>When I feel at ease, it shows on my face quickly, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>This is my first mission without those two. I was honestly really worried. We were always together, even at school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>But... Thanks to Suzuka and everyone else, I feel like I really did my best! And I didn't panic that badly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You were splendid, Noah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I think 'splendid' is overstating it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Heeey, Noah! The shaved ice will melt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Wh-what?! You bought it already?! I didn't select a flavor yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Emma asked me to hold onto the silver spoon in case something happened, but it wasn't needed this time around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Thinking of doing things for others will make a person stronger. Noah has truly grown as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Perhaps she may never need this spoon again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Heh, and Emma looks like she's having a good time. Having friends is a good thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Ah, the wind is blowing around trash!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hold on a second. This is a yakisoba tray and a stick from a corn dog from that beach hut down there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>This is...trash from the pirates, isn't it?! I don't believe it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ah, uh, wait, Noah. Calm down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I've endured a lot up until this point. But this is my limit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Right. I guess this silver spoon is still necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Showdown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Floating...letters...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Sigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Sending messages like this is really annoying, brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Albeaaa! Let's play!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Wait, I'm coming over now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>And that became a wonderful memory of summer.</td>
</tr>
