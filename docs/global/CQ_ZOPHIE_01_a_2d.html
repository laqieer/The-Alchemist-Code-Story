<td>You see how she is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, I see. She doesn't need any kind of special examination, just a check-up, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's right. We've already run out of doctors in this country who can manage her. We're counting on you, doctor of Saga.</td>

<td>As long as I can take home medicinal ingredients, I will do whatever you need me to. Even so...this is...</td>

<td>No! Hate, hate, hate! Die! I'm gonna die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It would be quite a big problem if you died. It will only take a moment, so do you think you could let me just take a quick look at you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No! No. Going home. Going home? Going home!</td>

<td>Sand everywhere where born. But came here. Right away! Since then, together! Friends!</td>

<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Sand...? Is that so? You were born in the desert. Hm... Were you perhaps brought here as a slave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>D-difficult. Don't know. But have friends! Happy!</td>

<td>Well... I am not one to interfere so let's get your examination done, hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh? Who are you guys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>From the looks of it, you don't appear to be very reputable customers. On the contrary, you look a lot like grave-robbers.</td>

<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's none of your business!</td>
