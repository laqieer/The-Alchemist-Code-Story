<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Thank you for helping. Actually, this thief has caused trouble a number times during the festivities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I can't forgive someone who would take advantage of people looking forward to Winter Holiday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Indeed. Recently, thieves will even dress as Santa Claus and lure people into traps... It's really giving us trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If you see anyone suspicious, please let us know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Some people are unbelievable! I guess bad kids also look forward to this time of year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Dressing up as Santa and stealing from people—that's as low as it gets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What a bad kid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is more than being a bad kid. This is criminal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's because of people like them that Michael and Lofia can't finish tonight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Their job is hard work, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>On that note... Let nothing else stop us as we prepare for this party!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We'll get the biggest tree ever, make it look lovely...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Since Michael and Lofia have worked so hard making sure everyone is safe, let's throw them the best party ever! They'll love it after working so hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes, I think so too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hey, do you know where we can get a bigger tree than this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I have no idea. This is the biggest size there is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If you want one even bigger, I reckon it'd be quicker to just go to the forest and find one yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The forest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's...peaceful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ahh, the sunlight is hitting the snow making it glittery. It's so pretty! Hm? What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hi everyone! Is something going on? Wait... Did you come here to check out the snow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>As you can see, thanks to the Maruda tribe we have a very wonderful white Winter Holiday...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's not that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I see...you're looking for a very big tree for the Winter Holiday party...and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Do you know where we can find one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No…I don't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ah! I bet the Maruda tribe knows of one. After all, they are the spirits of Winter Holiday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So...there is going to be a Winter Holiday party?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You want to join, Nina? It's gonna be a fun one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Can I? Really? I'd love to join!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Then it's decided. Since we're here, let's get the Maruda tribe children to join as well. So we can really make the party amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oh...but I have work to do. But, don't worry about me, just go ahead and have the best Winter Holiday party ever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Saying it like that makes us feel bad...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>By the way, what do you do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>My job is to monitor the Maruda tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I keep my eye on the area, so if any trouble occurs like before, I can immediately go and say "HEY!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If that's the job, leave it to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Who's that!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We listened to your conversation! The idea that the Maruda tribe, the very spirits of Winter Holiday, are preventing the party from happening is simply ironic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Put more bluntly, to say the Maruda tribe's carelessness is the reason... To say that you cannot particpate in the Winter Holiday party because of this tribe is absurd!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>They've changed their minds. Now they're sincere about making the snow fall for all the children looking forward to Winter Holiday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We'll be watching them for you! So make sure to fully enjoy yourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Nina, you work so hard, you're a good kid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Oh yeah? Hehehe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The snowmen insist, so, I think it's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>We are not snowmen! We are the Maruda Tribe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Yuki, Kyu...is it really alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Leave it to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes yes! The Maruda tribe is a friend to all children looking forward to Winter Holiday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Wow, Nina! How wonderful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>(It's great that Nina too can join the Winter Holiday party)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(She seems thrilled. This is really great.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hey, shouldn't we ask about the tree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I almost forgot! Hey, uh, you two don't happen to know where we could get a really big tree, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>A big tree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>We want the biggest tree ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>All the trees sold in the town's market are small, but the shop owner said we could find a bigger one if we went to the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I see! Then you should travel to the forest behind this village. The trees there will be perfect for your Winter Holiday party.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Oh, those trees are amazing! They were raised in the garden of the spirits of Winter Holiday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Really? Certified Winter Holiday Spirit trees...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Let us know when you find one you like!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>The forest behind the village? Got it! Everyone, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Wait a second Nina! You dropped something...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Ahh! Sorry, I dropped my little buddy I was making just now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You were making a what now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>This! It's a doll I'm making! I modelled it on the Maruda tribe. Hehehe, whaddya think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Umm…it's u-unique.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>T-that's right. Truly one of a kind...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Aww, it's so cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yeah... I like this one. I think it's cute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Yay! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I see. The sensibilities of young people, I suppose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>This isn't like the Maruda tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Don't say that too loudly. It might not be a good idea to say that out loud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I'm glad you two snowmen are so perceptive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>If we decorate the tree with these, it'll be the cutest tree ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Sure. It will certainly be different from any other tree. Like, if we did it this way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I see! That'll be great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Decorating is clearly your thing, Ravina. I can't wait to see the results!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Yeah. Looking forward to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>And, if we're decorating the tree, a doll like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Oh! Ah, my doll! Where did it go?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Ah! Heyy! You can't have that!</td>
</tr>
