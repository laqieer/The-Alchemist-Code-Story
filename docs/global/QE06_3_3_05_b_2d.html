<td>Is that the best you've got?! That didn't even require our full force as we are, much less the awakening of anyone's demon powers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh, certainly, but that was just an appetizer while the main course was being prepared. Your true fight begins now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Is this more to your liking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Dismortants!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Not quite. They're duplicates of myself, subdivided from my own body. Though this does little to distinguish them from those...other beings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I don't much care for those so-called Dismortants, you see. So I'd prefer not to use that label, even if that man did help awaken my ability to subdivide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But when the duplicates are my own, we can all more easily function as one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's galling to rely upon anything given by that conniving human, but it would be foolish not to make use of every advantage at my disposal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This should turn the tides, and bring you Blade Fox down once and for all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hyaaaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Now's my chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Whew. Thanks, Azami.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Keep your head in the game, Amane. That goes for you, too, Captain Ugachi. And you, Captain Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We Blade Fox demon slayers cut down demons by fang and claw, and are always ready to perform our duty to the last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We are demon-splitting blades, in the flesh! To that end, we must be resolute. Do not allow yourselves the luxury of distraction!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I would never! And you've got some nerve, including me in that speech...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Me neither. Let's all remember our oath, because this is exactly what we made it for. This is the time to fight like you all mean it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(Right. I took that oath, too.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(Celis, I've been blessed with such fine allies.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(You feel the same way about them, don't you? You warned me not to get too close, but that's kinda hard, all things considered.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(I can't just let people this good die in a such a pointless battle.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>(I want them all to enjoy your excellent cooking again, like always.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Of course, it'd be more fun if I were there too, but I don't wanna push my luck asking for the moon.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(So instead, I'm just going to pray that you, at least, make it back so you can watch over these fine people properly. And until then, I guess that'll be my job!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ghk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I never thought you, of all people, would lose focus so easily! Will we ever see that classic Captain Tanosuke spark light our skies again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It certainly has been a while, come to think of it. But if ever there were a time to bring it back, that time is now! So get it together already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Haha... Hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>She's got me there. These lot really are just the best. And when people this brilliant are counting on you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...you can't let 'em down, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Is this to be our last stand? Hardly. However many of us you cut down, I can readily replace them all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This will be your end, Blade Fox!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Seal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Well done. All right, everybody, take five. I've got it from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What do you think you're doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Seal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke... Don't tell me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi, I'm sorry I've always played so fast and loose with rules and procedures. I know I probably gave you gray hairs, but I love you like a brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And you know how you always tell me to stop fooling around? Well, I'm not fooling around this time. I want you to see my true potential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Azami, you've had things pretty rough. If I had it my way, I'd see to it that you lived a normal life in a peaceful world. If only it were that easy, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Last but not least, Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm going to be the one doing the protecting this time...because I choose to. So don't push yourself so hard anymore, okay? I'll keep you all safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>These sound a lot like final farewells. Whatever you're thinking, don't do it! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Looks like I really won't be able to come back. Sorry about that, everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>How is he this powerful?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What kind of person am I? I've been asking myself that a lot over the years. Am I more demon, or human?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>After a while, I kind of just stopped even bothering to question it. I figured it didn't really matter, in the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What do matter are the people in my life who are important to me. Protecting them is, always has been, and always will be priority one. That's just what I'm about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Without fail, whenever I'd go out of my way to protect something, a voice would always echo through my head:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Strength... I must gain the strength...to protect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You might think I was scared to unleash my power because I was worried people would condemn me for being a demon. But that was never it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I just knew in my gut that if I were ever to answer that voice, I wouldn't be able to come back from it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I was never sure if I were the only one who could hear it or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I also didn't know what, exactly, I wouldn't be coming back from. Maybe I'd just look different, or maybe I'd lose myself altogether. I had no real idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But if I can protect my friends by turning to the demon side, then I'm all for it. Losing my friends is a fate far worse than losing myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>So now, it's time. It's finally time to answer that voice and see what happens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>There's only one singular sentence echoing through my mind now: I must gain the strength to protect that which I hold dear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You're far stronger than anticipated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>But I have the numbers. This "generation" of subdivisions may be lacking, but they can and will learn. And with enough iterations, they will soon surpass your power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Strength... The strength...to protect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Whoever that voice in my head belongs to, I'm calling you out. What is it you're trying to protect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Is it weird that didn't feel like the first time you've pat me on the head? It felt...strangely familiar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Ahh, I see now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Those random moments of nostalgia, or the feeling I'd get when looking at certain scenery... They were all your doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Makes sense. And it also means it was worth putting everything on the line for. Even if you and I have different burdens to bear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...we both have the same need to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke! Can you hear me?! Captain Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Don't worry, I hear you loud and clear. And at this moment, I'm still Tanosuke. I serve the Blade Fox Corps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>And to that end—to protect all that I hold dear—I will now answer the voice that's been bugging me for years!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Tanosuke, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Can I make one last request of you all? A selfish one, really. And one for you to fulfill only if the spirit so moves you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I'd like it...if you didn't forget me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>My name is Tanosuke, Third Squad Caption of the demon slayers known as the Blade Fox Corps. And this...is me giving it my all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>What the...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Captain...Tanosuke?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Gah! What's happening to him? It's like his aura is pushing even the ground away to form a crater!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>...Tanosuke? Who's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I've just awoken from what feels like an eternal slumber, and my mind is still hazy. But I know my name, at least. My name... My name is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>...Tamba.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
