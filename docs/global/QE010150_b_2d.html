<td>I heard we'll be working for the Shadows now, or for those corpses rather.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Not really. I just figured I could make use of them. I don't have the slightest intention to bury those bones.</td>

<td>In order to find that girl, Agatha back?</td>

<td>It's like you say. Both Agatha and Logi may be alive somewhere.</td>

<td>It's possible that through the powers of the Sacred Stone, they could have been instantly transported to someplace far away.</td>

<td>Well... the Seven Sacred Stones that were scattered across the world attract another.</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If we manage to find all of them, we should be able to reunite with them. No half efforts all right?</td>

<td>Agatha...<br>I will definitely find you.</td>

<td>Question is whether the Sacred Stones will bring eternal peace, or whether they'll bring about an age of total destruction.</td>
