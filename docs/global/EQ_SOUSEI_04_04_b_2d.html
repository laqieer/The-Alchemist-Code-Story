<td>"O time! Infinite shall be your being!" Let's add to the festivities and shake up Space-Time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wow! Mira and Waginau are amazing! They're using techniques I've never seen the likes of before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hmm? Pretty neat, huh? This is the power of Space-Time Manipulation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't let your guard down! They're still coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ugh, there are still more? I'm running out of gas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's enough. Both of you, fall back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You have some kind of plan, I expect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Mira, hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(There is no more need for the usual casting. The door in my heart has already opened... Thereforeâ€”)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>"O winds! From beyond the Gate of Gluttony, come!!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Argh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Phew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh? What just happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That...wasn't the power of purification... The voices of all the spirits around us were tinted their own color...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh? The voices of the spirits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That is the power that Eulalia possesses. It seems likely that it may be magil, but essentially she is able to interpret the power inherent in all creation as voices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Does that mean that she has a strong reaction to magil? Whoa, I bet she'd be a super witch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But, um? Does that mean that you guys don't need me anymore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It means that from now on we likely won't have to rely on you so much for matters of magil. I thought you would be more pleased about that, Mira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hm... I feel kind of...complicated about it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Please explain, Nimul. That wasn't purification that you just performed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What you just saw was Alchemy. It is a technique I have been working on for a long time and I finally finished building its foundations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Alchemy is a technique which allows one to capture magil, the origin of everything in the universe, and manipulate it with their will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If proficient enough in its use, even without powers of purification... Even without the protection of Sephiron, it should be possible to turn corruption into something else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>In other words, anyone who learns that technique can protect themselves from corruption?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I am not sure if we can rely on a result like what we just saw...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Still, very precise control of magil is needed to perform this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Even now, it is all too easy to completely lose control of it if my focus fails even a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It must be simplified somehow. As of now, it is too difficult to use it when it is needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What I just did requires the preparation of a sufficient amount of magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You've got big dreams, huh... I have a strange feeling like...this story wasn't the genre I thought it was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This will be how Alchemy develops. But for now, let's remove ourselves from this dangerous area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I wish to go and save Emmel immediately, but first I want to deliver these rations to those taking refuge in the desert...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Nimul! Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's quite a shame. I thought I had you, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Nnngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No, it can't be... Why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Just as I'd thought. Not enough experience. How frustrating... If only there had been more time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Julia?! Why would you aim your weapon at Nimul?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What a question. One kills their enemies, do they not? Is that not what the warriors of the Sephira do?</td>
