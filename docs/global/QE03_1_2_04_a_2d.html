<td>Yikes! I got a little too carried away with practice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>If we run we can make it...oh! We ended up only practicing how to ride standing, and I didn't even teach you the rules!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Whoa! You're right...what should I do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's not that difficult.</td>

<td>Sabbath is a sport you play with a team of five.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Two of the five players ride on Broom Aces and attempt to remove their opponents' mask. They're called the Aces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's the job of the other three, called Lamps, to attack their opponents from the ground using magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The mask is worn by the team leader who is called the Face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This has to be one of the two Aces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's simple really. If you either shoot down or remove the mask from the other team's Face, your team wins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Shoot down?! That sounds so scary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It'll be fine! There's snow on the ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Besides, attacks are limited to weak fire magic. Anyway, if you set fire to the Face's clothes, it'll be hot enough for them to willingly fall on the snow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So about who's gonna wear this thing we're supposed to protect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wow! It's kind of beautiful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The mask was made in Saga from dragon scales. It's resistant to fire so it'll protect the face. This...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This time you wear it, Liz! You're the Face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What?! Not you, Alma?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Come on. This way it's more fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No, but...whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh? Are you getting caught up in the lure of Sabbath?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hey...something's coming this way!</td>
