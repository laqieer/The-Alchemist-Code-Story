<td>(At this rate, Melda is gonna stroke my fur again, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(Well, never mind. Now that I think of it, it actually doesn't feel that bad.)</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(She touches me quite gently, so, ultimately, I ended falling asleep.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(Yeah, this is how she strokes my fur...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh? When did you show up?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Heheh. Surprised? I am good at stealth—getting close to someone so that I can stroke their fur as much as I want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Fine. I lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I thought of a lot of things, but I couldn't think of anything else that could please you, Melda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I see. Anyway, I feel happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You were thinking of all these things for me, weren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, yes, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It means enough that you put in the effort to try and think of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm sorry I treated you as a child. You're a proper man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>On my part, I wasn't just stroking your fur because I thought it felt good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I did it because I felt myself thinking, ‘I can trust this person from the bottom of my heart.'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Melda...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Somehow, that makes me happy to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'll try thinking of more and more things for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Until now, I've never really taken the time to think of things like that...things for others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see. In that case, I'll wait with anticipation. You're like a younger brother to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I agree...Melda my older sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You're embarrassing me! Come here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes, my fluffy, fluffy, fluffiness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>He-hey! It always ends up like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Heheh...ahahaha. I look forward to getting to know you better, Flamel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ahahahah! Likewise, Melda my older sister!</td>
