<td>Hyaaah!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Whoa! There's still so many! There's no end to them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It can't be helped. Let's take them out all at once. Kagutsuchi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Phew... We finally got rid of them all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Can you please explain properly this time, Lord Zain? What is going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The sword I have is called Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I know. It's a holy sword that has been passed down from generation to generation of Lord Commanders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes. Do you know why it has been passed down? Why it's been this Excalibur instead of other swords?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Long ago, Nimul and Emmel, the alleged founders of Alchemy, shattered the Grand Excelsior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>After doing so, they used the very same raw materials to create another sword—Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The Grand Excelsior that was shattered by Nimul and Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...became the 7 Sacred Stones that bring balance to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>However, this balance will not last forever. If one of the Sacred Stones is exploited, it would cause the entire equilibrium to collapse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The Excalibur was originally handed to the Lord Commander long ago as a way of destroying the Sacred Stone if such a thing were to happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What are you talking about? What does that have to do with the fact that you just summoned a bunch of monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That was to observe your abilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Even if the source of the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi is different than the 7 Sacred Stones, it has similar properties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Kagura...your country, Wadatsumi, has an artifact similar to that of Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Y-you're not talking about the Kagutsuchi, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The secret art of Kagutsuchi—passed down for generations within the royal family of Wadatsumi—was most likely created with the aim of destroying the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This is just a theory, but it is quite plausible. We have found several such mentions in old literature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>When you say it like that...that technique was originally not to destroy goblins with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Could it be for when the Mikaboshi goes berserk?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes...because of that it was necessary to immediately check your Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Our conclusion was that your Kagutsuchi cannot destroy the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Seeing you battle just now, I understand that your technique is incomplete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...?!</td>
