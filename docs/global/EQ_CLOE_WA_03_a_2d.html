<td>The knights from my squadron looked uneasy today as well.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I guess the rumors are true. They feel anxious under the command of a woman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I still lack in strength. I know that. I need to be stronger than any other commander. I need to have the strength befitting a commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>In my current position, I can't call myself an effective commander yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I need to train more and become stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ack. I couldn't cut it down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hm? No... My sword is stuck.</td>

<td>Hmf! Come out!</td>

<td>Eeek!</td>

<td>Oh. Are you protecting the little golem? I'm sorry. You were hiding behind that crystal cluster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You've got such a small body, but you're doing everything you can to protect the little golem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That being said, what a beautiful crystal. You've got a lovely house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh, it ran away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It really is a beautiful crystal though. Heheh. It reminds me of the glass Captain Vettel gave me.</td>

<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That was the time Captain Vettel encouraged me...oh!</td>

<td>As someone who leads a squadron, your aim is to return safely with all your knights alive.</td>

<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I really am still lacking as a commander. I can't believe I forget something so important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>My most important task as a leader is to safely bring everyone back from the battlefield. And to protect everyone if necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Even the small, vulnerable golems risk their own lives to protect their friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Using myself a shield to protect everyone is something I can do. No, wait. It's what I always thought to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Why did I forget about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh, I'm such an idiot! A stupid, stupid idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Golem, Captain Vettel, thank you for reminding me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yes. I'll become everyone's shield. I'll hone that style of fighting!</td>
