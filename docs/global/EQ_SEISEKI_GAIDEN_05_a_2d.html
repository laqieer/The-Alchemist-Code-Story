<td>If they were Knights of the Holy Guard... It's only a theory, but...there's no mistaking that there's something substantial waiting to be discovered here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Interesting. I mustn't jump to conclusions...but if this is true...it's incredibly dangerous.</td>

<td>How's the observation coming along?</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>One step at a time... We won't reach the truth so easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It will likely require the same level of knowledge and persistence as fumbling blindly in the dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Fumbling blindly in the dark...huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This really is a huge undertaking... Overwhelmingly so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>However, this is what I want to do. It's what I was made to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I... What I want to do...is...</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Watching the knights in action made you doubt your decision to come with me, didn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I... Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's why I told you... You should just keep facing forward. I'll look backward, and uncover the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But...I need to protect everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The right person for the right job. You can't protect everyone by yourself, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Honestly... A chivalrous fool and a blockhead, trying to protect everyone... You really don't understand women, you know.</td>

<td>Heh...heheh...hahahah! Ahh, I never usually laugh like that.</td>

<tr>

<td>How nostalgic... I feel like we always used to talk like this when Cadanova was still here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hyahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hmm... That was good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If you never improve yourself, you'll be caught off guard... Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That was close, Yauras, but I can't let you beat me, now can I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You lack foresight. You need to visualize a few strikes further ahead; improve your perception.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That will allow your natural speed to flourish...but I must say, your improvement surprises me, Yauras.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Your technique is truly magnificent. I even find myself captivated by it. You should devote yourself to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Wh-what are you saying all of a sudden?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Just watch. I will wipe that complacent smile off your face someday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hmm, Cadanova is good with women... Unlike a certain someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But...didn't he simply praise Yauras' development?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Heheh... Lord Commander or not, you never change, do you, Zain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You're still a chivalrous fool and a blockhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Don't make fun of him, Kaya. Those are also Zain's strengths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Cadanova...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's rare to find someone who spends every waking moment thinking of the peace and justice of Babel... Alright, Lord Commander, let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I was hoping you would say that, Cadanova.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>This may be mere training, but with you as my opponent, I'm not going to hold back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We've fought more times than I can count...but I'm going to enjoy this, Zain!</td>
