<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Here he comes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I see. Just as you stated, even Fung Liu wasn't enough to stop him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huzzzaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Orion! Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What a rowdy visitor. I arranged for you to be welcomed graciously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'd like to return your generous welcome, but can you explain why I was greeted by an assassin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It appears orders weren't conveyed properly. My mistake...I apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>A mistake? You gotta be kidding me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So...did you come all this way to point your weapon at me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If that's the case then this talk is over. Waginau, I'll leave the rest to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You said that you could help me pursue absolute power that surpasses any in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I came here to ascertain the meaning of your words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I see. Well then, listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Tsk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'll be waiting at the entrance. If something happens, call me right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmph. So why are you pointing your spear at Emperor Orion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Don't get me wrong. I just came here to hear what you have to say. I have no intention of hanging around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Never mind. Well...what do you want to ask me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What do you mean when you refer to absolute power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm talking about an ancient power that is immense enough to affect the laws of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>An ancient power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You know about the brother and sister who created the Tower of Babel, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Nimul and Emmel. They unified this world, created the Tower of Babel, and discovered Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>How can I live on this continent and not know about them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Having seen the other side of the Door of Truth, Nimul fell into utter despair and attempted to destroy the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>However...it was his younger sister Emmel who prevented him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Eventually, in order to protect the order of this world, Emmel created the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Just so you know, I didn't come here to talk about folk tales.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>This isn't a folk tale. It's an actual story that leads up to this present day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The absolute power that I'm talking about is the same power that Nimul tried to use to destroy the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Are you saying it's the power that Nimul obtained?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes. I am trying to achieve that power; the very power that will shake the laws of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Are you serious? How would you obtain that power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That power won't appear unless the balance of the world is disturbed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The balance of this world? What are you talking about? Explain it to me in a way that I can understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This world is balanced by an extremely precise force that is supported by the Alchemy Source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The Alchemy Source...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The Alchemy of Power that revolves around Nimul...can change the laws of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>And the Alchemy of Love that revolves around Emmel...can protect the laws of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Alchemy is comprised of these two different natures of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Power...and love...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What I am aiming for is the one polarizing side of the Alchemy Source that is the Alchemy of Power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The Alchemy created by Nimul...? How do you propose to obtain it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>If we destroy the balance of this world, this power will no doubt show itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The two different types of Alchemy that constitute the Alchemy Source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Because there is a balanced equilibrium between these two forces, the world is kept in a state of silence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>In other words, if one of these forces of Alchemy were obtained and the equilibrium was destroyed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The embodiment of that Alchemy source will bring about an effect in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>There is a so-called "supreme judge" that maintains balance in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>As long as that person maintains balance of the Alchemy Source, the embodiment of its force won't appear in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>A "supreme judge"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>The one who maintains the balance of power and soothes the turbulence on this world. Their name bears that of absolute justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Wait...are you talking about the Lord Commander?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Yes. I guess you could say your slaying of Zain was a great step in the right direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That man was placed in the position of "supreme judge", yet he attempted to lay his hands on the Alchemy of Power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If you had not stopped him...he would've had full sway over this world by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>W-wait! Are you saying that I influenced the equilibrium of this world? That was never my intention...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Regardless of your intent, the outcome is the same. It was your destiny to destroy this world's equilibrium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Destiny?! Nonsense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>In any case, the moment that Nimul's Alchemy of Power manifests itself in this world is drawing nearer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Whatever the case, I will obtain that power. I will lead this world to its ideal state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What world do you intend to create if you get that power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It's quite simple. A world where only the fittest can surviveâ€”where those without power are not qualified to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>A world where only the fittest can survive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Kudanstein...how does this world reflect in your eyes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ugly battles are waged across the land, fueled by hatred, envy, contempt...and vulgar emotions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That is the current state of the world based on its natural equilibrium. Can you call this the ideal world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>The source of all this confusion is the lukewarm spirit of equality that has given birth to this balanced world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You were helpless amidst the destruction of Wadatsumi, unable to do anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>That's nonsense. If it were to become the kind of dog eat dog world you're suggesting, it would only increase the conflict...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You're wrong there. A world where only the fittest can survive is based around the absolute guidelines of power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Those with power lead; those without it obey. There is no room for conflict to be born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Look at the animals of this world. That is the true state of mankind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Was the destruction of Wadatsumi when you began to seek power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You were helpless admist the destruction of of Wadatsumi, unable to do anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>That memory, which most would wish to turn their back on, is at your core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>The reason why you continue to protect the daughter of Wadatsumi's royal family is because you want to dispel the notion of your powerlessness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Shut up! Don't act like you know me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>There's nothing for you to deny. That is the true nature of humanity. Your way of thinking is correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>It's not a strange thing to blame yourself when you are helpless...to seek power in order to change the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You understand well that power is absolute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>With your immense determination, it's unlikely you'll fall to the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Kudanstein...I beseech you to seek further power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>...Fall to the darkness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova used to speak of that often. What does it mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>There are two faces to the power we seek...that of light and dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>If the two are balanced it will aid the wielder as pure force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>And if they are not balanced?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>The heart will be infiltrated with darkness. Eventually, you will no longer be able to separate yourself from it, and you will fall into the world of darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Is that the world that lies on the other side of the Door of Truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Heheh. It's just a matter of not seeking more power that you can handle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>With your determination, I am sure you will be able to obtain an extraordinary amount of power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>However...right now, your determination appears to occasionally fluctuate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>First of all, you must do whatever is possible to protect the source of your determination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>The source of my determination?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I'm talking about Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>With her sealed in the Philosopher's Stone, the Paladins are heading to Ramproad Mountain in order to repair the Holy Sword Excalibur and release her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Of course...they ultimately plan to use her to obtain the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Kagura...she's still alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>That's the end of our discussion. We're wasting time here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Don't get me wrong. I will not base my actions around your words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Of course. I am in no position to force your will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I will find my own path to travel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Thanks for your time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Honestly...he's a real handful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Don't worry about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>He will destroy the equilibrium of this world. As long as he fulfill his role, I have no complaints.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Hm. It appears we have an uninvited guest headed this way. What would you like to do about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Let them do as they please. I have no time to deal with them.</td>
