<td>It's been a long time, Father. Things turned out just as Mr. Taras said they would. I...I cried the whole way here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>So much has happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I've been so busy with my duties as mayor that I haven't been able to visit you regularly. I only come here when I need comfort. I really am a horrible daughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Mr. Taras jumped from the top of the clock tower, taking the AJ7000 Prototype with him...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And just like when you died, I was left alone again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If that had been the end of it all, it would have been fine, but the Alkaroids are still functional...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Which means that their leader, the AJ7000 Prototype, wasn't destroyed by the fall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The people of this city, whom I ought to have been protecting, were so shaken up by this incident that they've shut themselves away in their homes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We were working so hard toward the restoration, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What should I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm all alone... Well, I have done my best up until now, even by myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's just that now, I'm a little lonely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, I should change the flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>These flowers... They're new. Could it be...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>In my mind, Mayor Edward is still mayor of Redington City.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If we're gonna start an all-out war here in his city, I gotta apologize to him first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Mr. Taras... You were father's—and this city's—ally all along, weren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You came here to apologize to my father... You were ready to sacrifice yourself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Trying to sacrifice himself in order to save the rest of us humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's not a collaborator: that's a friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Heheh. Hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Mr. Taras, why did you leave white roses for my father?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Father, I'm sorry that it was such a short visit, but I must be going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It seems that there have been friends at my side all along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I just didn't notice them until now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It looks like I have to keep moving forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Bride... Fiona... Signal has been located in this sector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>S-sensor error detected. Regular security ch-ch-check impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>R-r-r-reproduction u-u-urgent. P-porting required for p-p-population data memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I-i-imperative.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That took a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Bride. Located.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, it only makes sense that you'd be slow now. You probably won't be able to use those legs that Mr. Taras broke either, hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Legs suffered significant d-d-d-damage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's just like Mr. Taras told me, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>To win, you have to destroy your opponent's weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wedding d-d-d-dress? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Your weapons...are your data analysis and your insane speed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You can't make use of that speed anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Furthermore, you have proposed to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>M-m-memory retained... Does not compute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Please try and analyze it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>In your data, do you have any record in your database of a groom assaulting his bride at the altar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>A-analyzing... Data not found.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>We have only happy marriages in this city, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Statement is h-h-highly l-likely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Excellent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What relation does this s-s-style of dress have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You are my bridegroom, are you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>A-...ffirma-...tive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Can you attack your bride?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>If you can attack me, and destroy a wonderfully happy wedding ceremony, then go ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I won't run or hide anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Archive not found. Data not found. C-cannot v-v-verify attack orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>A-attack... D-d-d-d-dis-...tress... Unable to execute regular output.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Funny, I don't seem to have that problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I retain the memory of our happy wedding being destroyed. I have all of that data inside my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>After all, I am the bride who called off her wedding almost as soon as it had begun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I left you behind, and I moved on. Someone helped me to move on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I remember it so clearly, even now. Recalling it fills me with hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I no longer have any doubts. I will not hesitate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Y-you may leave everything to machines, and live a life without pain, fatigue, or want. You will not have to lift a f-f-finger...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>That is a wonderful thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>W-wonderful. Acceptance c-c-confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>However, we cannot walk along that path together. There is no happiness in that kind of life, nor is it the kind of freedom that would be worth fighting for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>If I can't step out on my own, I won't even be able to enjoy the feel of the wind in my hair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Moreover...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I really don't care for your face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>F-f-f-face?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>It's not that you are a machine, so much as that I do not want or need a cold, mechanical love. It's not you. It's your programming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What moves a human heart, and what is truly important, is that one's partner has a strong sense of duty and morality!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I don't want to lead a self-indulgent newlywed life, and I certainly don't want to spend the rest of my life with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Insufficient data may be imported from Don Taras and patched. L-l-let me d-demonstrate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>If you choose to think of this as underhanded, then so be it. A split couple will ultimately and unavoidably get in each other's way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I will stop you in your tracks right here! I will move forward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>This is how I file for divorce!</td>
</tr>
