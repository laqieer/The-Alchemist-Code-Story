<td>Nnghh... Darn it. Shayna's boyfriend is crazy strong...just like her.</td>

<td>Would you like to be next?</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>S-Sir Alfred! Don't do it! Her boyfriend's seriously strong! Even a veteran like you doesn't stand a chance!</td>

<td>Nngh...</td>

<td>Hm...? Did you say boyfriend? Wait, wait, wait... You've got this all wrong.</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh? Lost our nerve, have we, Mister 005? Is that number really all you have to show?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There's no beauty in that. After all that talk about your long membership... But those were just words, weren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Tch... Me? Lose my nerve? Don't be ridiculous. I'm Shayna's biggest fan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If you really are her boyfriend, then we must fight.<br></td>

<td>You don't need to thank me, my lady. I am here to protect you, after all. Hm...? Do I detect a venomous glare?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>C-cut that out! Don't go getting all cozy with Shayna in front of me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Please... I've already told you that you've got the wrong idea about Shayna and I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Shut up! Now prove to me that you have what it takes to make Shayna happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Or rather, I'll just defeat you and become Shayna's boyfriend myself! This ends here!</td>
