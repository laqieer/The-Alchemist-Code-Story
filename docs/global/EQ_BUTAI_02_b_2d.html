<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Sorry for the rough greeting, Kudanstein. It is good to see you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It can't be...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The Emperor of Greed Dike...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I welcome you to this defiled land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Orion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Or...I suppose I should call it...my land?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>How nice to see you here, Princess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Still...how unfortunate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There is no throne for you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I hope you have enjoyed your little visit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Orion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Kudan! Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Damn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Why did you lose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wh-what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Do the Paladins of the Holy Guard not represent justice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Then tell me, why did Wadatsumi fall? Why do the people of Wadatsumi continue to be vulnerable and exploited?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Why do you still cling to a hopeless ideal? Why? Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Nrgh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It is because you all are weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I will ask you again. Will you not wield your spear for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Like I told you before, I will never serve you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And that is your justice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Absolutely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Is that justice truly indisputable? You mean to tell me that you still trust in the righteousness of a justice that cannot actually defeat evil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Shut. Up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I do this for the sake of the peace of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>You're the cause of this suffering! You have no right to make such a claim!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I am eradicating the powerless filth that know only how to proclaim their so-called rights. I am respecting the warriors' will by commanding their strength with total authority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I will unite this continent with absolute power, crushing the seeds of rebellion and quenching the fires of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>There will soon be no war. Peace will come to this land of willpower and strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's nothing but sophistry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It is natural law. The strong devour the weak. Everything in this world⁠—be it plant, insect, or beast⁠—knows this to be true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Why do humans alone disobey this law? It is because the weak swindle the righteous with claims of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Because fleeting emotions like love and trust are considered to be unquestionable truths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>From our perspective, it is the weak who swindle the righteous, monopolize the power of Alchemy, and still somehow fail to maintain peace who should be considered the evil of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Just shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Break away from the unscrupulous masses who feign righteousness. All of your remorse stems from a lack of strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>With strength, you can move forward. You can bring an end to irrational violence. Yes, you can bring an end to it. I will help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>With our combined strength, we can end destruction and conflict for good. We can bring order to this continent! Kudan, look within yourself. You know this to be true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I said, shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Any justice backed by empty words is powerless. You understand that. Power is everything! Strength is justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Orion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Kuza...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What are you doing? Why...why are you standing there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Will you not accept his offer, Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>This is no time for jokes, Kuza!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>This is no joke. I brought you here to give you a chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No, this can't be true. We swore an oath! This is impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Come with us, Kudan. This is how it's meant to be. You can't protect the world with your justice. It's just not enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Kuza...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What are you thinking?! Tell me this isn't true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You know you can't defeat me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Kuza! Huzzaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Don't try and stop me, Kagura! I trusted him! I thought of him as my brother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Nnrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Don't you see? This is the extent of your justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Serve me. Then you shall gain true power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You will come to understand that absolute justice is on our side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>D-damn it all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You refuse to listen? Then I'm afraid...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I will show you. You will come to see the truth. Just as he did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Don't you move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I won't let you go! Basheeny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You! You summoned the Phantom?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Why...? You swore to defend Wadatsumi! What are you playing at?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I won't let you take Kagura. She is the only sliver of hope I was able to protect! She is the spirit of Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You leave me no choice but to make you understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Absolute Zero!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You know, I never expected to see this many Holy Guard captains gathered in one place. You do know how to make a man feel special.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>We won't let you get away with this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You will unhand Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Ngh! Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What incredible power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Hahahahahahahaha! You want her back?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Let her go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I will be generous. You can have her back...if you don't mind her without a head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Wait! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>K-Kudan...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I will put her head on show for the people. With their hope dead, this country is finished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>However, I'm willing to make you a deal. If you come with me, I will release her. You may sell your soul to save that of an entire nation. Am I not a generous king?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>This is becoming quite an interesting opening act for my continental campaign. It would be a shame to end it here. Let us reconvene another day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Kudanstein. I will allow you some time to think upon the meaning of justice. The next time we meet, I expect you to have the answer I want to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Kuza, wait! Don't turn your back on me! Kuza! Kuza!</td>
</tr>
