<td>- Goetia, Slothstein Branch -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Welcome back, Emrys. Godslayer spoke glowingly of your performance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Happy to be of service, Madam Eliza.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Is there another "affair" you require taking care of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Not for the moment, no. I called you here for another reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Leave us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>As you wish, Queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Eliza produces a small humming device and holds it up with a smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Are you familiar with this device? We use it to measure Alchemia levels within our patients.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It just so happens that one of my subjects has turned up something...interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Take a look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This signature...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Is that of your dear sister Eira? But that is not all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We discovered traces of a second signature alongside hers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tell me, Emrys. Have you ever wondered about the origin of your sister's condition?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Do you really suppose it is nothing more than a rare curse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This second signature belongs to a man named Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>An apathetic researcher who exploits the innocent for his own nefarious goals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Turning to live subjects, he inundated them with Alchemia, causing the sickness that now afflicts one individual each generation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I need not elaborate which clan he chose for experimentation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(Something doesn't quite add up about this theory.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(So many have fallen victim to the curse, and the origin conveniently reveals itself only now...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(I should conduct my own investigation later. As for her...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Unbelievable... That a single person could be the cause of so much suffering...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Where is he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>In a mansion right here in the city, like a cornered rat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Awaiting the justice we are about to dispense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Inform the entire branch to prepare for the assault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Contact Nesha and tell her to proceed with her mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh, and if it comes down to it... Tell her she has my permission to break her target's legs, if it will stall him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Emrys, you will join us in ridding the world of this black-hearted villain, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I would like nothing more than to see his life forfeit for his crimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>As you well deserve. Good hunting, Emrys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(I wonder if I'm going down the wrong path.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(I swore that no one would ever pay for my mistakes with their lives again...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(...No matter what happens, I will find the truth myself.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>- Slothstein City Outskirts -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Very well. Send Queen my love for the permission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I think I will enjoy having this one on his knees. Very much so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Uh, I have to go, miss. It's urgent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>She'll throttle me if I don't show up soon, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Goodbye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wait! Mister Siegfried! Come back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hmhmhm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh, this is going to be a treat, my little ladykiller.</td>
