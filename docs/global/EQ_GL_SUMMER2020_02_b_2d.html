<td>Say goodnight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ahhhh! My stall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Damn it, we won't forget this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Look at this mess! How am I supposed to run my stall when all my ingredients are smashed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh no... please let me pay you back for the damage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>... sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>How will the beachgoers get any food and cold treats around here now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>A day's earnings won't bleed me dry, but there are people round here looking to crack open a cold one and enjoy fresh seafood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ugh, he's got a point... and we did start the fight after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(What am I going to do? This isn't something money alone can solve...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It would seem our encounters are never fated to be without some excitement, unfortunately it's never of the pleasant sort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Could you not have chosen a more elegant approach to handle those ruffians?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What? Who's there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Shion!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It is good to see you again as well Miss Roxanne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I wish I could say the same... out on another one of your so-called "business trips" I see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Although my work never truly ceases, I am allowed a brief respite from time to time. Today I'm just here for a little... sightseeing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Right... just like when we met you back in Lustburg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Despite what you may think of my family and me, I still am genuinely grateful for your actions that saved the lives of my sister and her betrothed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Lord Zheng Yi has been deep in reflection since then, and we have all been making utmost efforts to correct our past ..."indiscretions".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>As for my presence... I've heard that the beaches are wonderful this time of the year, and so I came to see if it would make a suitable vacation spot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Shion glances at the ruined stall with a regretful smile</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>although it would seem that I will have to enjoy them without any hope of refreshment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Thanks for rubbing it in...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(Yet another human to contend with, coming out here really wasn't wise after all)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And who might your two new companions be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Eira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You may call me Morrigan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>And you came alone? What about Asuka?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>My beloved sister practically forced me away from my duties. She chose to remain in our household to deal with other matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I would very much have preferred to stay with her, but she insisted that I took some time away from it all. And so here I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What's this, the ever-collected Shion is troubled by the absence of the precious little sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I didn't think it was possible for you to even feel lonely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hmph, says the Lady who still has yet to win over her childhood sweetheart?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Perhaps you would prefer I redirect my attention to him once again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Don't you dare! He's not so blind that he'd fall for a trap like you anyways!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh, so you are more perceptive than you initially seem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But, I am very confident of my charm. Believe me, I can be very persuasive... to anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I would never lose to a flatchest like you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>... flat... chest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You shouldn't concern yourself with this Eira. Humans have... quite the derogatory terms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Eira... don't understand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>A woman's figure isn't everything you know, if not you would have captured your beloved's heart long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Grrrr... even though we're no longer enemies, I really feel like beating the crap out of you right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It would be wise not to begin another pointless conflict. We still have yet to address the shopkeeper's demands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yeah! All your bickering isn't doing anything to solve the problem here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>If I may, perhaps we could settle both our disagreements as well as the issue of food together in a more... entertaining manner?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Interesting, what are you proposing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>How about a food challenge? We each produce a dish to sate the beachgoers, and see which of us can garner the most sales.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That's... actually not a bad idea. But what's in it for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Well, I am quite alone and rather bored, and I would very much like to put our vastly different charms to the test.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You really think you can beat me huh, you're on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Well then, I will be taking this one as my partner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Eira... partner?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Of course! Together, we're going to show Miss Roxanne that a woman's appeal doesn't rely solely on her "Assets". Come along!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(No malice... it seems he speaks truthfully)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(Although I'm slightly concerned, this situation is much too amusing to pass up)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Go along with him Eira, it won't be fair if all three of us were on the same side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>... ok...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>(This is a good chance for Eira to enjoy some new experiences as well)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Are you sure she'll be okay? She doesn't seem very comfortable with new people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Eira will be alright. As reserved as she is, her heart is always in the right place, and others will always appreciate her for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Besides, I believe right now we have a more immediate challenge to focus on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Right! There's no way we're losing to that washboard, let's get going too!</td>
</tr>
