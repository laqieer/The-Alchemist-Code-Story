<td>Phew. Well done, me! Not fazed in the slightest by the sudden monster attack, I swiftly repelled it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Clap, clap, clap. You're really strong, Ramses. So, please, come with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What are you going on about? Is it hidden in some nobleman's vault?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No. The mineral ingredient for this glowing paint can only be obtained from a cave deep in the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But the monsters have gathered there in their desire for that very mineral. I wouldn't be able to manage on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But you can't expect me to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I've finally implemented the first strokes of the portrait that you requested of me long ago. However, at this rate, I won't be able to finish it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What?! You've finally started painting my portrait?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes, but...without the glowing paint, I cannot do your beauty justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Did you just call me beautiful?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Indeed. Recently, when I observe you with the eyes of an artist, you seem to shine radiantly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's why I want to use that paint to express your radiance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see! Indeed, I see! Hyahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If you wish to paint a depiction of me then, by all means, witness my strength up close!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Heheh. Thank you! Come on. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(...Scheherazade has worked her magic on me again. She really knows how to talk me into things.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's pitch dark. Are you sure this is the right way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. It should be... Hehe. You know, you've truly become reliable compared to the old days, Ramses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hmph. There's no need to talk about the past!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Besides, of course, I've improved! As the Successor of the Sun, I am constantly honing my brilliance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Heheh. Right. Oh! Ramses, over there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh?! The wall is glowing! The mineral must be in there! We've found it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I believe so. The light that is leaking from it is beautiful it entrances me. Huh? The wall is collapsing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Scheherazade! Be careful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Agh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ramses? Are you okay?! You shielded me...and now you're bleeding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I-I'm fine. This is just a flesh wound. More importantly, look at that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wow! The debris is sparkling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If we dig through this collapsed wall we should be able to harvest plenty of minerals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Screeech!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Argh! They've gathered here in pursuit of the mineral.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But...this mineral belongs to Scheherazade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ramses!</td>
