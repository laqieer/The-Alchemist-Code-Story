<td>Suddenly, I was dreaming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Everyone was laughing, sitting around the dinner table.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's was just an ordinary dayâ€”one of many, from not so long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It was a fun memory. A fond memory. But most of all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...it was a sad memory...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...because I knew it was a dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I knew that at any moment, I was going to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Don't give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The resolve I entrusted you with has not yet been realized. I know it hurts, but I need you to stand up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>To save Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's right. I'm not finished yet. There's still more to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I can't let it end like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Where am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Finally awake, are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Jubei! You're okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Relatively speaking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What happened with Judius?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>He managed to scuttle off with his life. We'll have to settle things another time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh. But, that's okay! I'm just happy to see you. How's...Captain Ugachi? Is he...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>He's alive, at least. Though he hasn't come to yet. I did the best I could to treat his arm, but frankly, I doubt he'll ever swing a sword again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh. At least he made it back, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So, did you rescue us, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yeah. Sorry I didn't get to you any sooner, but it took longer than expected to get out of that rubble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Once I finally did, there was no one to be seen anywhere. I figured you might need some help, though, so I followed your trail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You're saying he just...left, without finishing me off?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Sure did. I couldn't tell you why. He definitely had time. But thanks to that, you're here now, safe and sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>How peculiar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power, Judius, and now Tamba... There's so much left for us to contend with, it's a bit overwhelming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But because of me...Azami is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Amane...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I don't know what to do now. I don't know...how to go on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I just don't understand why. Why must this life be so full of hardship? Why must fate be so cruel? What did we do to deserve this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I only want to live in peace. How can something so simple and natural in concept be so difficult to achieve?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Jubei?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Draw your weapon. And face me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What? Are we fighting?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>At times like this, it's best to file away your worries and move your body. That's when the way forward will present itself to you...most likely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Most likely?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Tell me this. Will your tearful pleas change your predicament? Will help come for you when you're hidden from view and face-down in the mud? We must each forge our own destinies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>During my time in the Scarlet Flame Guard, it was often said that it takes a thousand swings to improve one's technique even the smallest degree. So, shall we work on ours together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>If you won't come to me, then I'll just have to come to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>W-wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>If you can argue, you can fight!</td>
</tr>
