<td>Whew. That homunculus hasn't shown up yet, though. It's too early to relax.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's too lazy, even for Sloth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The Colonel and the locals who offered to fight with him encountered Sloth while approaching from the opposite direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We may not have been able to take him down without your group distracting the guards. In any case, now that we’ve safely regrouped, we have some intel to share.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Colonel! Lieutenant! I didn't expect to meet up with you here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Lieutenant, thank you for all the information you gave us. It's not exactly happy news, but...it's helpful to know that the transmutation circle was activated several years ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It seems that the Dimensional Gate and all of these mechanisms are of too large a scale to operate all at once, so their plan was to open the Gate little by little over a longer period of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That means that those of us from Amestris are here as a result of the Gate opening briefly and sucking us in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>In other words, we can't stop it from opening at all. With something as big as this, though, it'll be almost as difficult to stop once it gets going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We should just take the tower down! We have to stop this! This... This...perversion of creation...is powered by unwilling victims!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Knowing that there have been more so-called Blessed Ones like the General before, who must have been sacrificed already... We can't just let that go on! Not now that we know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I won't lie; there were moments while we were researching this when I felt physically ill. The Amestrian State Military has committed its own sins, but nothing on this scale...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I spoke carelessly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No... It's like you said, Colonel. We, of the Holy Order... We've strayed too far from the path of righteousness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If it was just my soul, perhaps I would be fine with it, but to make sacrifices of all those children's souls? Of their lives? As ingredients for alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's...beyond the pale. As a guardian of alchemy... As a human...! I just... I can't... I can't accept it. It's...unforgivable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Calm down, General! It's not your fault. You are not the Holy Order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Edgar... Edgar, I'm so devastated... I just can't forgive myself! It's unbearable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Lean into it, General. This maelstrom of emotions is something that every human comes to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Don't forget what it feels like. Just be careful not to let it sweep you away completely. If it ever gets too much to bear... Well, I'll be here with a shoulder for you to cry on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Nn...nngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Emotions can be so overwhelming... Edgar...I wonder... Have you ever experienced this emotional maelstrom?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yeah. Of course. A thousand times, at least. In good times, in bad times... Joy, pain, shame... The maelstrom doesn't discriminate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's not all bad. The maelstrom is how humans find the strength and determination to keep moving forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Determination... I see. Looking at you now, I feel like I kind of get it. Maybe... Maybe now, I can speak that way, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We have to take down those towers. We can't let that Continental Transmutation Circle bring about so much tragedy and devastation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I agree. At first, I thought it might be best to take them down one after another like this, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I once summoned some Phantoms who may be able to help. I'll have them lend you a hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Mei Fang! Teona! Ravina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You require my strength? Very well. I defer to your judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This is somewhat nostalgic... Long time no see, Paladin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You called me? You must despise me. Or, perhaps...yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Please, we need your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Of all the Phantoms I've encountered, these are some of the strongest. I'm sure they'll be of use to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Indeed. Their help will be welcome for both reconnaissance​ and in defeating the tower sentries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>We'll take our leave here then. Follow closely, you three, or we'll end up doing all the work ourselves.</td>
</tr>
