<td>Belphegor...the Sacred Stone that quells the Republic of Slothstein. I heard that it was once enshrined within that clock tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Usually, I would keep it safe once again within that clock tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>However...this stone brings about conflict within the hearts of men. Perhaps I should take it with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That would be problematic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Alvarez...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The Sacred Stone Belphegor is our country's treasure. I cannot allow a foreigner like you to take it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Logi, son of the great sinner Zeke who was captain of Envylia's Blue Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So you've done your research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You seem to be leading an army of volunteers. What are you plotting? Do you plan to use Belphegor to bring about chaos in this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Right back at you. You've taken down the Elester family and obtained Sacred Stone. What then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmph. Can you not see the peace within our country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>How many lives do you think were saved by bringing Alkaroids and Demons into this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...And filling them with Alchemic energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Alvarez, I don't know what kind of world you're trying to create, but what you are doing is abusing the laws of the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If you want to know what I mean by that, just look at what happened to my country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The tragedy that occurred in Wratharis and Envylia wasn't caused by a Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>All of it was the unfortunate results brought about by the faults of humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And you're saying you don't have similar faults?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Of course. The world I am creating is one where all the rampant evil has been wiped out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>An ideal world of complete integrity where only justice remains. A world void of humanity and, thus, void of human faults.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Even if evil were to be eradicated and only justice was to remain, evil will inevitably rise up again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Because there is evil there is justice. It is impossible to completely eradicate evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>In that case, it's just a matter of driving it out again. Wouldn't you agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's not the true form of this world. Individual interpretations of justice should be allowed to co-exist. A leader of a country must consider all such interpretations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hmph. You sound just like Taras. I guess you're birds of a feather after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Your ideology is dangerous. For the sake of this country...I beg you to reconsider.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You're one to talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>These are the AJ5000 models. They're quite a different beast from the Alkaroids you've fought until now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I am one to talk. After all, I've experienced first-hand the true horror of Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I am painfully aware of the sad fate that awaits those who are seduced by its power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But...is Alvarez really heading to the clock tower?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Just because he took Ethan the Timekeeper, how can you be sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>True...if that assumption is wrong it will lead to a substantial loss in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I don't think that idiot's guess is a bad one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Mr. Taras!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Alvarez's train was spotted heading towards the clock tower. Apparently, he had a considerable amount of Alkaroids with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Their monitoring system is quite impressive...but we also have a way to monitor them that rivals theirs. We won't let them out of our sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>A way to monitor them...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm talking about the citizens of Redington. There are still many citizens who don't want to accept Alvarez as mayor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>They were the ones that leaked the information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Mayor Edward is no longer of this world, but his influence continues to live on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Your old man is still supporting you now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>My father...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yep. There's no need to be lonely. Mayor Edward continues to live on in the hearts of his citizens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>In a way, this city is a representation of your old man. I'm sure he'll continue to protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Mr. Taras...thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You don't need to thank me. I'm just speaking the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Don! The Guard Droids are headed this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hmph. Enough said. The fact that they showed up speaks for itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yep. There's no doubt about it; Alvarez is headed to the clock tower! Let's go!</td>
