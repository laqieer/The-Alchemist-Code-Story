<td>001</td>
<td>Haaa...haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The city is—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's quiet now, but... Look. So many areas appear almost as if they've been...gnawed on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Where did you go, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wh-what's⁠—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's...a tower...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh. So that's what the Infinite Serpent has been hiding up its sleeve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Kinda underwhelming for a trump card, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm just saying, isn't it supposed to, like, pierce through the Shell of the World? Sure don't see it doing any of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's got some serious magil behind it, don't get me wrong! But, like...enough to change the whole world? I have my doubts on that one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Then again, I guess if this is the best even the dragons could do, it's...fine. Good on us for accomplishing even this much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>When you get right down to it, even the dragons failed to defeat Ouroboros and gave up, in the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So what you're saying is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That this thing is suspiciously unimpressive, which means it's probably not done showing its true colors yet. Gonna be hell in that vortex from here on out, I suspect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We're still going up there, though, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. Because that's where Nimul is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But how do we get in? Can Space-Time Manipulation do the trick?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Eh. I mean, we could try, but with the magil all messed up like this, we could wind up getting ourselves thrown anywhere. Even the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If you're really raring to get lost in the space-time continuum, I'm up for it, but I'm assuming that's probably not ideal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Then our only option is to go on foot, I suppose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Got that, traitor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Gonna play nice and show us the way? I bet you know a shortcut. There's no way there isn't one. Otherwise, you'd have had a pretty rough time transporting resources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You listening? Don't forget that you owe me your life, and I fully intend to collect. Prove yourself useless to me, and your life is forfeit. You got that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Senile old fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Sorry, come again? Recently, my hearing has been acting up. Must be these old ears! I'll need you to speak a little louder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...There's a hidden underground path. That's your best bet. If it still exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Thank you, Ignacio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ignacio?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I know. I won't betray you again. I couldn't even if I wanted to, since you confiscated my gun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(What kind of purgatory is this? I'm still alive. It's ridiculous.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(I should have died. Now that I've sullied the name of Ignacio, I'm nothing more than an altar of shame.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I bet you're wishing you'd just died, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Don't act like a baby.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I mean, what kinda plan is that, anyway? Just throw a tantrum, then die so you don't have to deal with the repercussions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I know you think of yourself as some kind of villain, like I did. You were hoping to just get your dirty deeds done, then leave this world behind, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>This...is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Where...? I was...being controlled by Bianca, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>And then...aah! What's happening now?! Where am I?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There's...nothing? Absolute nothingness... Is this a dream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You are within yourself, in the deepest parts of your soul. Even the Primordial Serpent cannot extend her influence this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Is that...Sephiron?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yes. Greetings, Nimul. It's been a long time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Within myself... Have you been here the whole time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ever since you established your connection to the Godwolf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I must say, I did not expect you to do something so rash as to take the cores of the Cursed Beasts into your own body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I couldn't think of any other way at the time. I had to do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>And as a result, the tragedy of the Superbia Belt finally found its feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...You're filled with hatred. Why? Is it the betrayer, Ignacio? Or the mastermind, Bianca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Either way, it is understandable. Both have strayed greatly from the path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It is not wrong to resent them, and for that to curdle into hatred and anger. That is what it means to be human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>No, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>In the end, I am angriest at myself, Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It was my choice to begin this journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It was I who wished to change the world. No one else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>The truth is, part of me wanted to destroy this world for what it's done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Then why not accept the Ceremony of Creation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Because the Ceremony of Creation is not the result I set out to achieve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I wanted to save everyone. I wanted to change the world, without harming the people in it. That's what I've been seeking all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I can't make the choice to change the world by erasing everything that came before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>The future should be built on our past, step by step, inch by painstaking inch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I see. That is an answer very characteristic of you, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>And I intend to make the most of it. I will not compromise my principles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>When Bianca stole my body from me, the light overflowing from within me disappeared for just a moment. She has the ability to control that power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That's what I need most right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...For some time now, I've taken notice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You and your sister are rather unusual. You are emotional beings, as all humans are, but you are somehow able to make cool-headed decisions as though you were not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>There was a brief moment where you seemed on the verge of giving in to your emotions, but now there's no sign of that in you at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I just don't want to make the same mistakes again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>And yet, Nimul, as I said... It is only human to be emotional.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It is the root of humanity—their sin and heart alike. Those who abandon that truth lose what makes them human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Do you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'm not concerned with any of those finer points. I have a promise to fulfill...a wish that I must see granted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Very well. Then at least allow me to give you some advice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Bianca's true nature lies in giving, rather than stealing. She cannot directly possess your body and make it do her bidding—not in the way you are thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Rather, it is through sharing her magil that she was able to take indirect control of your body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Are you saying...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>What is once shared cannot be taken back to share again. As such, once you've regained control of your body, she is unlikely to retake it, for lack of magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>She almost certainly does not have enough power at this point to try again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>...! Then I must regain consciousness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Yes. I will assist you in your waking. It is time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>May I ask why you're helping me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I've chosen a path that no Sephira has embarked on before. And yet, you've come to my aid, despite all the risks and uncertainties. Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>For one simple reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I love you. All those who bear the mark of the sephirah are my beloved children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Goodbye, my wayward son. I pray that the end of your journey yields something better than what once awaited us so long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Thank you, Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Shell capacity at 86%. Perhaps it's time to take this a little more seriously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I never expected a bit of castoff could display so much power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>What did you consume, little one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Haven't you been paying attention? I'm only borrowing this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>It did not occur to me that there was so much magil available on the surface of the world. That data, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I see. The Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>The seven dragon pillars of the world, collected within a single human child... A potent combination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>In order to defeat you, a source of magil that exceeds yours is necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Such a source does not exist in isolation. That's why they failed. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>If one were to collect the sinful magil that humans create unconsciously...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>In other words, the seven Cursed Beasts who collect and store that abundance... Yes, combined, they would be more than sufficient to rival your power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>——...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>That you are Fallen is proof positive of the veracity of this plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>This little egg is nothing compared to the power of human ambition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Finally, the time has come. The dream shall see its end. Surrender, Ouroboros!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Access to Gula Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Access to Luxuria Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Access to Acedia Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Access to Invidia Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Access to Ire Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Access to Avaritia Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Access to Superbia Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>The central pillar of the Shell of the World falls here, today. Prepare yourself, Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>The light they left behind... The conclusion they could never reach... Let me show you the power of the seven dragons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>"Polluted waters of the Shell, hear me now! Breach the containment walls!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>The scale of this magil...! Do you intend to take over the very Shell itself? Will you take control of this body overflowing with corruption?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>How many hundreds of layers will you pierce with a single strike?! Human sin truly is a power of almost unimaginable scope...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Goodbye, my true self. With this, the mistakes we once made shall be wiped clean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Haaaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>The deed is done...I dare say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>It's a stroke of luck that it could be finished before the Shell was pushed to full capacity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Next, upon my authority, I should be able to dismantle it altogether...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Not quite. It's still holding together more than you'd think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Wh-what?! The corruption that had corroded the Shell is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Nng...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Gnrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Why...? How...? I should have...overwhelmed you completely...already...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Indeed, sinful magil is not something that was originally designed to exist within the Shell. That was rather clever thinking on your part. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>I suppose you hadn't considered what effect there might be from having already been corrupted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>The sinful magil I used...is already contained within you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I am the administrator of Truth in this world. I am this world and this world is I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>The dirt, the flowers, the wind and stones, the ground itself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>The people. All of it is I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I grant that there was meaning to be had in their journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>To challenge the gods, to challenge the Truth of the world, and in the process exorcise the darkness within the Belt Regions... It gave me the opportunity to recalibrate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>I determined that people were worthy of my governance. And to that end, I accepted some of the corruption into myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>You... No! That can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Wait... What? How?! The magil supply from the tower has stopped!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>I've taken control of your cunning little tower. We share the same abilities. Did you really not consider that possibility, either?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>You truly do deserve commendation for devising such an innovative surprise attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>However, for you to face me when you are me... That was your mistake and your folly. That was your downfall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>If Nimul stood here now instead... Well, things might have ended differently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I can...still fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Beelzebub?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Fitting, isn't it? I created it from the template held within the corruption I absorbed. It's not quite the real thing, but I think it'll be more than enough for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Urk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Grooooooarrrgghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>I-it...hurts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>I came so far... And yet... I'm...sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Grooooooooooaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>No... I can't give up yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>You're right. We can't give up. Dying here would only render all our sacrifices up to this point null and void.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Huh? Nimul—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>I'm taking it all back, Bianca. My body and my battlefield!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Everything has spiraled completely out of control. Everything I've worked for has turned out nothing like I'd intended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>So I can't stop now. I will take down God with my own two hands if I must. I will rewrite the way of things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>I'll remake the world! That's what I'm here for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>All right, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Heh. I've only now just realized that I'm in the same situation as Waginau. Even I have to admit, things have gotten rather interesting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>He overcame the control of the castoff. Humans truly are full of surprises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>So, you finally turn your eyes to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>You've always cast your attention on Emmel rather than me, much as you've always had your sights set on the world rather than the people in it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>You are not mistaken. That was indeed where my interest first lay. The future of the world, and the sacrifice that would be required to bring it into being...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>In fact, it would not be inaccurate to say that that was the only thing I was interested in for a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>But that's all changed now, child of man—child of humans born upon a bed of our own built-up sins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>You may hold your head high, for it is thanks to your stubborn refusal to submit to fate that I have fallen this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>?! "I am Transcender of the Gate of Envy!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>She blocked that torrent of corruption without even needing any help from a Cursed Beast core?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>(This is no time to be analyzing the situation! I need to get myself out of danger first!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Urk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>She's too powerful! I can't do this on my own...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Wait! That vision just now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Bianca? Is that you? That light... Did you send it...to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>This is the end for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>I have no other choice. I have to try it!</td>
