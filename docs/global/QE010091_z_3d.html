<td>I received a report that you conquered one of Wratharis's forts alongside the Holy Guard. Well done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>His deed of defeating the Demon is one deserving high praise.</td>

<td>When the Holy Guard was backed into a corner, he saved—</td>

<td>Lord Gabirond, now is not the time for such talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Due to the resurrection of the Demon, the Holy Guard suffered extensive damage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Sabareta, the leader of the Lizard Brigade, is the one who plotted its resurrection—he cannot be disregarded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Your Majesty...please dispatch me immediately to aid the Blue Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Your worry is unnecessary, Dias. We've received news that Zeke, Logi...and Agatha are safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Re-really?! What a relief!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>However, to use the expression 'out of the cauldron and into the fire,' the situation has become one we cannot sit idly by and watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What does Your Majesty mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Zeke has advised me to initiate a peace treaty with Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He recommends making Wratharis a dominion and appointing Agatha as their representative.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What?! Agatha as their representative?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Peace with Wratharis...?! Impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I have fought many a battle with Zeke and we have long been friends. However, in regards to this, I do not know what he is thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...Your Majesty, Captain Zeke was originally reluctant to join in the crusade against Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Although this is nothing more than speculation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Captain Zeke's guilt at having killed so many in the last war may be, now, leading him down the wrong path...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Please! My father is no fool; he would not allow himself to be consumed by some passing emotion. He must have a plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...Regardless of what the truth is, it does not change the fact that Wratharis is a loathsome kingdom, responsible for initiating conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That it would so easily open its doors to establishing peace is very unlikely...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Your Majesty...allow Dias and me to reorganize the Holy Guard and make our way to Captain Zeke. I will confirm his true motives with my own eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Very well. Dias, Gabirond, I leave it in your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes, Your Majesty!</td>

<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes, Your Majesty!</td>

<td>What is father thinking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>He's even involved Agatha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ag-agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What's the matter, Dias?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>N-no...it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>In any case...we need to confirm my father's true motives!</td>
