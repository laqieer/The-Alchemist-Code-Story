<td>Why so glum, Melty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Anastasia... Have you finished evacuating all of the villagers yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes, they should be safe. Now all we have to do is focus on suppressing the Wave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Is something troubling you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>N-no, I'm fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Do I not look fine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm sorry, I must've been mistaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No, you weren't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I must protect everyone as the next in line to the throne...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But I'm still so incompetent... Everyone is always saving me instead...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Melty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I thought that I'd be able to finally prove myself as a future leader of my kingdom...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But I can't do anything on my own in this world... I'm just constantly being reminded of my powerlessness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I can't believe I spoke to Naofumi like that... I'm not ready to be queen yet if I can't keep my composure when times get tough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm worried that I won't be able to carry out my duties as princess when I return home at this rate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'd be able to seek retribution for the knight who was attacked if I could just fight on the frontlines...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And I probably could've done something if only I'd known about the hatred against demi-humans sooner...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That may be true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But as someone whose job it was to protect the royal family, let me say this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I don't think I'd be able to focus on my own fighting if the princess of my kingdom was fighting alongside me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The best way to help your knights on the battlefield is to stay safe and sound away from battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>As royalty—as someone of higher standing, you mustn't give your frontline soldiers more to worry about. That's your responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That is only my personal perspective, however. I'm sure royalty isn't the same everywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's up to you to decide what kind of ruler you will become.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Melty... Don't forget that it's important to face adversity head-on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>As helpless as you may feel, you need to take a hard look at reality and figure out a way to use your own unique skills and position to fight your battles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>And even if nothing goes according to plan, everything will turn out for the better in the end so long as you keep on living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes... So long as you just survive...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Anastasia? Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm sorry, I was just thinking of something else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Don't worry, Melty. All you have to do is figure out what someone in your position is able to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>A way to use my own unique skills and position to fight my battles...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(I think Naofumi told me something like that before, too...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Are you worried about her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Sort of. She tends to overthink things on her own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The monsters from our world are terrorizing the people of yours...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>They shouldn't be here, yet I can't even do anything to stop them... And I'm a princess... I'm pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>As Melty Melromarc, the successor to the throne of Melromarc and its second princess, please accept my sincerest apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It sure seems that way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I find it to be rather admirable. Despite being so young, she's still doing her best to fulfill her duties as part of the royal family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I guess that's true...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>As one of the Heroes, I should be helping her accomplish that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(But in order to do that, I need to reconcile with the three Heroes that tricked me, looked down on me, and even scorned me...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ugh... She keeps telling me to reconcile even though they couldn't care less...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Is that not your duty as a Hero?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I can sympathize with you, though. It must be difficult to gain the trust of those in an unfamiliar world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>But you should take into consideration the fact that the friends watching you go through this are also having a difficult time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Melty looked devastated when you were talking about that earlier. I sort of understand how she must have felt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The person who I hold most dear to me also had to struggle alone, just like you. It's because they always behaved recklessly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It was so terribly painful watching the person I held closest to me suffer so much... I didn't want them to think that they were dealing with it all alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I didn't intend to leave them all alone... I'm sure your friends feel the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You may indeed have been alone in the beginning, but now you have companions who believe in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>So if you are truly being falsely accused of this crime as you've said, you should clear up this misunderstanding immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You need to settle this for the sake of those closest to you, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>For those closest to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>N-Naofumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>U-um... I just want to, um... I wanted to say that I'm sorry for how I acted earlier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Naofumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...No, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You didn't do anything wrong. I should've explained my reasoning better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Yeah, I need to do a better job of explaining things... For their sake, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Naofumi, the time limit you told us about is going to run—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The monsters keep pouring out of the rift... So this is what a Wave looks like... It's truly frightful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>We'll probably be able to suppress the Wave if we take down the boss. We just have to figure out where it is first...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Yeah... But just standing here won't do us any good. It's hiding behind the other monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Naofumi, watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Haaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Lord Naofumi, are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Raphtalia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Master! I'm here, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Oh, hey, Filo... Glad to see you're okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Is that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>It's coming for us, Lord Naofumi!</td>
</tr>
