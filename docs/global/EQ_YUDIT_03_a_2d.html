<tr>

<td>Okay... So it's like they're Mega Taurus, and they're affecting all the other Taurus around Babel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huh. Interesting. Sounds like you're definitely gonna need my Mecha Weapon on this campaign!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So? What're we waiting for? Let's get going already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>O-Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What's wrong, Bud? I would've thought you'd be the first to agree with a proposal like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I do agree, but...seeing someone even more charged up than I am zapped me of energy for some reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And why shouldn't I be worked up about this, huh? We can't let creatures like that run free! We've gotta do something about this before people get hurt! Right, Basheeny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The Giant Taurus have already wiped out the team most capable of combating them. This is going to be an incredibly dangerous mission, and it wouldn't be right for me to endanger a citizen like yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Basheeny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>At least, that's what I should say—but honestly, I'm relieved to have you with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Your Mecha Weapon will help us save countless lives in our battle against the Taurus. If you are truly willing, I'd like to formally request your aid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Sure! I mean, I was planning on tagging along whether you agreed to it or not, but it's nice to be invited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Thank you, Judith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We believe that the cause of the Giant Taurus' rampage lies in their appetite for Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If left unchecked, the Giant Taurus will eventually reach the Matter. We must act quickly, for this outcome must be avoided at all costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh? Matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Matter is a substance powerful enough to rival the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wow... I didn't think that was possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>In other words, if the Giant Taurus eats that stuff, we'll have an even bigger problem on our hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>As if the Giant Taurus weren't a big enough problem all on their own...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The point is, we have to strike before that happens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>However, it's important to remember that the Giant Taurus we face this time are different from any we've fought before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>A single one of these creatures could likely corrupt the entire forest of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>But Saga is not the only nation in peril. If they absorb enough power, these Taurus could threaten our world on an unprecedented scale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It would seem that the Taurus we once fought have evolved into a new and more powerful species—at least, that's what I've gathered from the reports. It's also possible that they have reverted to some more primal form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If such things are indeed possible, I wouldn't be surprised if an even greater threat were to arise in Babel at some point...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Ugh... I sure hope not. This new kind is crazy powerful enough as it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I think your father suspected this before any of us, Judith. He feared the advent of a threat that would eclipse the Taurus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Your father... He sent a report on that subject to the Holy Order of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh... I didn't know about that report, but he wrote about a threat like that in his journals, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>These journals... You've read them, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yeah. He mentioned some terrifyingly powerful creature that once roamed Babel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And that if it were to come back, humankind would face an unprecedented disaster...or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That's why my dad invented the Mecha Weapon: to give the world a means of fighting that creature!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>There's a bunch of other stuff in his journals, too, but most of it's kinda hard for me to follow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Still, I can tell that my dad was doing everything he possibly could to protect this world that I live in—for me, and everyone else who lives in it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Thank you for sharing that with me, Judith. I appreciate it, but I don't think you should mention those journals to anyone else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>For your own safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Y-yeah... You're probably right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Anyway, whatever ginormous monstrosity shows up next, we'll be here to deal with it and protect the people of Babel! Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Right... Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The mere existence of immense Alchemic powers can throw the balance of this world into chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Our role is to serve the world and its people by eliminating such threats in order to protect them from harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Eliminate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That reminds me of something you said before. "If something even has the slightest chance of endangering Babel, I will eliminate it, no matter how small the danger may seem."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Then you said something like... "For the sake of our future, I need to be more careful."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I didn't know you paid so much attention to my words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>They probably stuck in my mind because I didn't like them. Even now, I can't say I fully agree...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But now that I've seen more of the world, I kind of get where you were coming from. I get how easy it is for power to change peace into chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's why any big power is feared and mistrusted. I see that now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(Even my new-and-improved Mecha Weapon is going to be seen as a threat by some people.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(But even so, I...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Judith...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I still can't forgive the Holy Guard for killing my father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>But sometimes... I can kind of understand why it happened. I can see that you were driven by your own ideas of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You shouldn't force yourself to understand, or forgive us. It's only right that you should hate the Holy Guard for what we did. For what it's worth... I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You don't need to apologize. I know you're not the one who killed my dad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>True, but as Lord Commander, it is my duty to shoulder everything that the Holy Guard has done and will do: past, present, and future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>For it is my mission to protect the peace of the continent and the world that has been left in my care. Both because that is my role as Lord Commander, and because it is my heart's desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Basheeny... I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hey! What do you mean "your care"? Don't act like this is all on you! The three of us swore that vow together! Didn't we, Bud?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Exactly! Don't go thinking you're the only one protecting this world. That's why I became the captain of the Blue Flame Guard! To keep people safe, and...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>And...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Bud?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Basheeny is tackling his duty head-on, and fighting to protect everything that was entrusted to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But what about me? Isn't there more I should be doing as the captain of the Blue Flame Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Maybe I'm just...not cut out to be captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Oh, come on! Quit berating yourself, will you? It's painful to listen to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huh?! D-don't tell me I said that part out loud!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Afraid so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Whew. Y'know, I had no idea you had so little confidence in yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Tch... Just forget you heard that, all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>H-hey! Bud! Wait up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>What am I going to do with those two? Anyway... We'd better get a move on too, Judith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>R-right!</td>
</tr>
