<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/basi.png" alt="Basheeny" height="128"><br>Basheeny</td>

</tr>

<td>These journals... You've read them, then?</td>

<td>Yeah. He mentioned some terrifyingly powerful creature that once roamed Babel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yudi.png" alt="Judith" height="128"><br>Judith</td>
<td>And that if it were to come back, humankind would face an unprecedented disaster...or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yudi.png" alt="Judith" height="128"><br>Judith</td>
<td>That's why my dad invented the Mecha Weapon: to give the world a means of fighting that creature!</td>

</tr>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Eliminate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yudi.png" alt="Judith" height="128"><br>Judith</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yudi.png" alt="Judith" height="128"><br>Judith</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/basi.png" alt="Basheeny" height="128"><br>Basheeny</td>
<td>I didn't know you paid so much attention to my words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yudi.png" alt="Judith" height="128"><br>Judith</td>
<td>But now that I've seen more of the world, I kind of get where you were coming from. I get how easy it is for power to change peace into chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yudi.png" alt="Judith" height="128"><br>Judith</td>
<td>That's why any big power is feared and mistrusted. I see that now.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/basi.png" alt="Basheeny" height="128"><br>Basheeny</td>
<td>You shouldn't force yourself to understand, or forgive us. It's only right that you should hate the Holy Guard for what we did. For what it's worth... I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
