<td>Oh? What happened to the two of you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'll tell you what happened to us! Do you remember how much I told you not to cause a scene?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What do you think you're doing chasing Rattys all around town?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I didn't intend to cause a scene, you know? It's just that, well...I wanted to use the little Rattys to assist me in my experiments!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm gonna catch you anyway, so you might as well give yourself up! I won't hurt you! Just gonna squeeze a little juice from your tail!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Nu-numaa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Stop taking advantage of the chaos to engage in animal experiments!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Alright, alright. I'm sorry! I didn't think it would be such a big deal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wow! What a spectacle! This year's Halloween is really something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Especially that monster's costume! It's so well made! Considering the size of the costume, I wonder if it's a child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Come now...don't be too hard on her. Fortunately, with Halloween in progress, the townsfolk seem to think it's part of the entertainment. Hehe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wow! That kid in the Ratty costume is really playing the part.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...Ye-yes! I completely agree! A-ahah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I want to give that kid some candy, but...the ones that were supposed to be here still haven't arrived yet. I wonder when they're coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Right...what happened to Neica and the others?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It does feel like they're taking rather too long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>All right. Let's go and check!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Phew! It's finally finished! They look really good. You're so talented, Neica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Since I've finished making the candy...I need to go outside and deliver them, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, that is the mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Sigh... Of course. Oh dear... I'm especially not very fond of Halloween. Why did they have to call me to this event?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmm. I understand how you feel, Neica, but I'm sure you'll enjoy it once you see everyone's smiles! Come on. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Numaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Eeek! Re-really, again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hey, come on. You guys are getting annoying. Why are so many of you gathering here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Numaa! Numa! Numa! Numaaa! Numa? Numu! Numaaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Come to think about it, these Rattys are acting differently than usual. Don't they seem...excited?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>They've been gazing at Neica's candy all this time. It can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey, everyone! Are you all right?! The Rattys again?! What are they doing here...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Let's talk about it once we get rid of them. Honestly...Halloween is quite a tedious event!</td>
