<td>The Sacred Stones will beguile people on occasion, and give their desires form...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Even if nothing would change if their desires were to be fulfilled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This is a story that took place on the continent of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The story of a bond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The Phantom...is a Wadatsumi shrine maiden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>She was known as the savior priestess for dedicating her life to the restoration of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>She was quite famous for the healing prayers and dances that she performed even before royalty, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Someone was manipulating her soul as a Phantom?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes. I saw it with my own eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yet you saw no sign of any alchemists there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>They must've done what they could to avoid leaving any trace of themselves behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This is weird. I mean, what's their overall objective?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>These people of Wadatsumi were killed under the guise of archaeology for the transmutation of Philosopher's Stones. Isn't that what you reported?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, yes, but...I still feel like there's more going on here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's highly inefficient to work on nothing but assumptions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You know I'm your superior, right? Why are all of our female knights so scary?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wadatsumi is still under occupation by Greed Dike. If civilians are being abducted, it'll result in a huge blow to their reputation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What if Greed Dike is involved with this issue?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's not so far-fetched an idea to think that Greed Dike has continued to make the people of Wadatsumi suffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't you see? That is precisely the kind of assumption that we should be avoiding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You can only say that because you don't know him! You don't know the kind of man Orion is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We need to stop Greed Dike as soon as possible! Lord Zain, you need only say the word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I understand how you feel, but we cannot act without sufficient evidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This is just like the time they invaded Wadatsumi! Are you saying that the people of Wadatsumi will not be protected from Greed Dike's cruelties?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I am not saying that we will ignore the issue. You are not alone in this, Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We took up swords to protect the weak. Much like you did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But how can I protect anything if I do not act?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You protected me, Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Kagura...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So don't be so hard on yourself. I hate seeing you like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's right! We can't change the past, so let's do what we can for the future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>How can you be so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I was entrusted with something important, too. Captain Cadanova entrusted me with the protection of this continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>So...I think I know something of how you feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We cannot overlook the misuse of Alchemy. We should gather evidence as we investigate the matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It wouldn't be splendid at all if we did nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>True. I mean, a Phantom was involved, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Are...are you all on board with this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Never forget that you are not alone in this. We would not let you bear this burden all by yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You're always overthinking things. Learn to live life simply! There's no point in always being so worked up about everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You should probably try thinking a little more though, Monzein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Please stop stirring each other up. Don't you realize how inefficient this makes things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I want to formally make a request as the captain of the 4th Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Please allow me to investigate Wadatsumi. I need to confirm what is happening there with my own eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I ask the same! I cannot stand by and do nothing as my homeland is trampled over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'll go where you go, Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Kanon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You do realize that you could be sending your comrades to their deaths? On top of that, this could be taken as interference in domestic affairs, and could potentially devolve into a disaster of international proportions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Even knowing all that, you are still resolved to go. Is this correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Raise your head, Kudan. Will you take full responsibility for your decision and actions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Very well then. The 4th Regiment will proceed to Wadatsumi and conduct a direct investigation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Lord Zain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>This is nothing more than an investigative mission. Any battles you engage in must be for the purpose of self-defense only.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Y-you're allowing us to go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>We share the same sense of justice, Kudan. Just don't push yourself too hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Thank you! The 4th Regiment will depart immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Good luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Yes, sir. We're going. Make ready as soon as possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Yes, sir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Yauras, bring Basheeny here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What? I mean...as you wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Is something wrong? Did I do something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I'd like to ask you to do something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Kanon, this is Basheeny. One of the trainees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Yes, of course. I know of him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I'm placing him under your direct command. Understood, Basheeny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Absolutely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>U-under my...?! What's this all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You've been in the Holy Guard for a good while now. It's about time you learned a few things about having subordinates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Treat him well and teach him what is expected of a Paladin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Are you sure I should be responsible for him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I want to entrust him to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Well, then, I'll...I'll do my best! Nice to meet you, Basheeny! I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Please be gentle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>And Kanon...please watch over Kudan for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Me? Watch over him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>You'll know what I mean, I'm sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I place my faith in the light within you that Cadanova trusted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Now go. Take care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Let's go, Basheeny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Why entrust Basheeny to Kanon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I just had a feeling that this was the right move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>The light Captain Cadanova entrusted the peace of the world to, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I simply cannot shake the feeling that the fate of this continent rests on their shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Everyone else, get to investigating this issue from other angles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>What we must find out is who is gathering Philosopher's Stones, for what reason, and who summoned the Phantom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Don't let any little details fall through the cracks! Innocent lives are on the line here. Report back on everything you find.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>It is our duty to prevent the reckless abuse of power. We must never forget the calamity that this continent suffered ages ago as a result of the great power of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>We cannot allow its misuse to go unchecked. We must never forget the responsibility we bear as those with great power ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>This world will not be one where the weak are exploited by the strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Be righteous, for we are the absolute justice of the continent. I am counting on all of you to make that apparent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Looks like we might get a lead sooner than I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Leave this to me. The rest of you hit the targets ahead of us. We'll pull as much information out of them as we can! Go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Phew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Basheeny, what was that power you used just now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Nothing you need to worry about. Let's regroup with Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Answer my question, Basheeny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Come to think of it, don't you use the power of darkness, Captain Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Who...are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Just a newcomer. I don't intend to get in the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>At least for now, I suppose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>You're way too suspicious of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I'm asking as the captain of the 4th Regiment. Depending on your answer, I may not be able to allow you to come any further with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Well, this isn't good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>There you are, Basheeny! Don't go disappearing on me like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I won't accept disobedience! Captain Kudan ordered the three of us to work together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I, uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>You're under my care! No more going off and doing your own thing, got it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Wait, I just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Got it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Yes. I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>You know...you also act on your own, disobeying orders all the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Shut it! I'm sorry, Captain Kudan. I should have kept better watch over him. Basheeny! You apologize, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I'm...sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Hm? Oh, right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Is something the matter, Captain Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Kanon, you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Ahh, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Wadatsumi has changed so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Yes...so much of it has been burnt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>I remember this place being alive with greenery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>What's the matter, Kagura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Look. There used to be a village there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>There's...nothing left of it now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>It was such a large village. They used to hold a festival every summer. Everyone was so happy there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>But now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>You saved me, Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Had I been stronger, I could have saved more lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>It's not too late for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>So long as Kagura is alive, Wadatsumi's spirit lives on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>You protected the only hope left for Wadatsumi, Captain Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>You... You just had to say the things he said, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>I don't ever want to feel the way I did that day again. I can't stand to watch people being taken advantage of anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Nobody should have their home taken from them. That's why we have to find whatever evidence we can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>We can't let the people of Wadatsumi suffer anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Everyone, look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Greed Dike soldiers?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>I knew you lot were involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Wadatsumi is under the rule of Greed Dike. It isn't odd for troops to be stationed here. Besides, aren't we the ones who are coming here uninvited?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Basheeny! That's no way to speak to your superior officer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>I was just making an observation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>I'm gonna give you a lecture after this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Now, then. If you are involved, know that we will show no mercy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>You're going to tell us everything you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Kudan, calm down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>What...are they?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>I suggest we retreat for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>We will not retreat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Why? Wadatsumi isn't even your home. What pushes you to—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>You've never had to witness the unbearable horrors that I have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Need a hand, Brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>If you can't beat them all, then you just need to stall them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Kudan, now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaaaahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Are you all right, Kagura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>I'm fine, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Long time no see, Kudan.</td>
</tr>
