<td>What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The village is burning! How can this be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That's the Royal Army! How did they get in?! What happened to the barrier?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Dangit! It was pointless to take the long way home to avoid being followed! I could have been here to help prevent this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Commander! Wh-what should we do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Keep it together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>For now, prioritize evacuating as many survivors as you can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Those of you least injured, rendezvous with the guards and halt the enemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Those of you too injured to fight, follow me to the Chief! We must find out what's going on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Commander, what about Sephiron? Sephiron is on fire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(It's too late for Sephiron. Nothing could survive after taking a bombardment like that.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(But...I don't dare voice that out loud. I cannot afford for their morale to suffer.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Believe in Sephiron! A bit of canon fire is nothing to the great tree Sephiron!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Th-that's right! Come on, everybody! Let's go save our people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huzzah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Malta, Kamui, please be safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Chief! Chief, are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Isidore, you have returned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Chief, what happened here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>They came while we were preparing the resurrection ceremony. The enemy must have known somehow that we would be vulnerable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But how...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It isn't such an impossible idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We Sephira have lived hidden here for generations, but there have been those who chose to leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You mean one of our own people betrayed us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Sadly, yes. Our bond with each other relies heavily on our shared dependence on Sephiron's blessings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It is very possible that those who left the village found it necessary to sell village secrets to make a living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's just... No, now is not the time for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>With the mirage barrier gone, we can no longer protect Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We must hurry and evacuate the villagers to somewhere far from the fighting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No, we must gather the warriors and assemble at the base of Sephiron. We must stay and protect the tree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What?! Why?! Chief, do you intend to sacrifice the villagers for the sake of a dying tree on the verge of burning to the ground?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Fear not, Isidore. Sephiron will soon be reborn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Chief?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Malta is performing the resurrection ceremony. With her sacrifice, Sephiron will regain her former power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That will turn the tide of battle. We must hold on until then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Sacrifice? Did you say sacrifice? Malta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I am sorry, Isidore. I could not bring myself to tell you. As the next Chief, this is the inevitable hardship that you must endure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Inevitable? What?! What are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Did Malta know this whole time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Chief! You... You...?! How could you sacrifice your own daughter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Did you agree to our marriage knowing she would be taken away like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(—ill)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(—ill th—)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Urk... Aah...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(Kill them all)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(Your love was taken from you. Betrayed. Then...!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You understand, Isidore. To protect Sephiron is our most sacred duty. Malta's sacrifice will not go—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(Then you must take everything from them!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ahhh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I suppose...this is how I reap what I have sown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wh-what just...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Chief?! Wh-what have I...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It's fine. I, too, have felt the rage you feel now. No one can escape the darkness that lurks within.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It is...painful to lose...the ones you love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Do not, though, be turned... Do not drown in the temptation of darkness. That will...lead you...to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Temptation of darkness? Did I...? No! How could I...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Haha—ngh! It seems...there was turmoil in my heart as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>But I...need you to understand... We cannot let...our traditions die out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Please! Don't move! I will bring someone that can heal—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Do not! You cannot...let anyone see this. It will affect...your standing among our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>This isn't the time to worry about such things!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>This is...exactly the time... Listen to me, Isidore. I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I...hereby bestow my title as Chief upon you, Isidore... You must lead the Sephira now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Isidore... It is the Chief's responsibility...to bear the sins of this village...no matter how much blood flows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Our traditions...must live on. We must...never lose hope...in our blood-soaked fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I cannot! Never will I be able to tell my children to abandon the people they love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I used...to think that as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Please, Isidore... Respect the determination...of those who have chosen...to be sacrificed. Do not let their deaths be in vain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Chief? Chief!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>My love... At long last...I will finally be at your side again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Wh-what have I...? I can't... I...I didn't mean to...! Why did I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Aaah!!! Stop, no! I don't want to d—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Mommy?! Mommy, no!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I must focus. There are still...many people that I must protect. There are still many reasons to fight on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I will never forget what you have done, Chief. Someday, I will see you again in hell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You owe it to this village and its people to grant me the strength to protect them all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ngh—gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Haa... Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>There's too many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Did all the survivors in this area make it out? Then I should find the guards and join them in the fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I'm sure the Chief must have a plan to get us through this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Besides, I must have a word with him about the resurrection ceremony...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Found another survivor! A villager!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Ah. It seems like I have to take care of this first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>He's alone, but don't get careless! They can use some mysterious, alchemy-like sorcery!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>A mysterious sorcery, huh? There's no need to hide it anymore, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Let me show you what I learned from my mentor, Waginau: the true strength of the Protector!</td>
