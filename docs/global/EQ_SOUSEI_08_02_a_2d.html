<td>The winds...are so strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's this realm's particular characteristic. The unending gales make it impossible for anything here to last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Anything native to this land, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Human ingenuity allows some of us to call even this harsh environment home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Space-Time Manipulation: Ignition. Destination: Good ol' Vice City.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Welcome to the stronghold of the Infinite Serpent, and Superbia Belt's one and only metropolis:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>A town of free spirits known as Hierosolyma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Impressive...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Lord Quence? Is that you? I'd heard you were attending to business in the Ire Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I was, but that business led me back here. Is Lord Shahel around?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Of course. He's eating his lunch at present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Seriously? Guess I should have timed this better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm sure Lord Shahel will be most pleased to see you, lunchtime or no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's what I'm afraid of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Quence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hmm? Oh, Shahel is the name of the leader of this Belt Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And he also happens to be the head of the Infinite Serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The leader of the Belt Region?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What are you so surprised about? Nimul's the leader of Gula Belt, isn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes, but that's different...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>At any rate, Lord Shahel is quite the gourmand. Every time I see him, he gives me recommendations for all sorts of foods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You two must be...pretty close, then, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>He's like that to everyone. But the problem is, after he eats, he always goes into a serious food coma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Uh... Come again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We don't have time to wait for him to wake up, though, so come on, Boss. We're going to head him off at the pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>"Boss"? Do you mean me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What, don't you like being called "Boss"? The only other thing I'd feel comfortable calling you is "Ma'am"...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Um, you can always just call me by my name...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...Did you forget my name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Of course not! A man of my intellect would never forget anyone's name! Not even that of someone he only ever met once before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh, right, you were one of Ambrosia's older apprentices, weren't you? That must mean you're getting a bit up there in years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So what if I am?! That doesn't mean I've gone senile!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Rrrg... That's right! Emmel! Your name's Emmel! I finally remem—I-I mean, of course I know your name! See?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Of course. Anyway, like I said, you can just call me Emmel. So, you were saying you'd take me to meet Shahel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes. Come with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Mm, thish pie ish beautifully baked! You can tell, right, Helene? The crishpnesh of the crusht can only be achieved through ekshpert control of—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I understand you're excited, Father, but could you please not talk with your mouth full? It's very unpleasant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, don't be like that! This is so good, I have to sing its praises in the moment! There's no time to swallow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ah, I'm ready for my wine, if you would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Of course, Sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ah, the act of eating is such a stupendous thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I can understand why so many of this Belt Region would succumb to such an indulgence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You may very well be the one who indulges in it the most, Father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>But of course! I could never pass up such a perfect means to learn more about human culture. You'd do well to try it yourself, Helene!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Unlike we, who feel the magil of the world directly, humans must depend on their senses to perceive the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste... When you eat, all five are thoroughly stimulated. It is a truly divine experience!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yes, yes. I've heard all this before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You are even more talkative than usual today, though, Father. Did you receive good tidings, perhaps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I did! I heard tell that Zafeiris was defeated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>All this after attaining the coordinates for Gula Belt and so triumphantly marching forth! I'll have to tease him about this when he gets back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That old dragon corpse was taken down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Indeed. Imagine: a dragon—one of the beings who created the high elves—was actually bested in battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What's more, he wasn't even bested by the famed Guardian Dragon, but by a mere human!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Such powerful humans are finally beginning to show themselves... It seems our efforts have begun to bear fruit, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Maybe. But you could also be jumping to conclusions again, just as you did with Avaritia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It's certainly possible. But high expectations are free, so why not indulge in them from time to time? Disappointment is a risk, but when the expectations are met, oh, the satisfaction!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Speaking of, this wine is simply divine! Do I detect some fruity notes on the end, there? I've never tasted anything like this before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It's a reproduction of the grain wine produced in the Avaritia Belt Region you were just speaking of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Why have you never served me this before? I dare say I'd love to drink this every night!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Its manufacture is quite complex, and we only had Lord Yna's verbal instructions to go by, leading to many failed attempts. However, we were finally able to recreate it with some persistence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ah, I see. I suppose there's no way around that, then. When he was here, reminiscing about his past was really all he ever did. I'm impressed you were able to glean anything from those ramblings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I wonder if he's finally been able to move on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Pardon me, Sir—oh, were you in the middle of a meal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>My son! It's good to see you. Come, sit. I'll have them prepare some for you as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Well, I... Ah, thank you, but there's no need. I've already eaten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Very well, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You must have business with me, yes? Even if we are not blood-related, I still think of us as family. You may speak with me on any topic you wish, at any time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>In this case, I simply came to deliver a message. You have a visitor. Lord Quence brought a guest who wishes to meet you in person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>We'll have to ready a proper welcome for this mysterious guest, then. My apologies for cutting our meal short, Helene.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Oh, no, that's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Though it's probably just another miserable stray one of the serpents picked up on patrol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Well... I wouldn't be so sure about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Hmph. As if you're in any position to judge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Let's see how you feel after you've met her. I, for one, was rather caught off-guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Well met, esteemed guest. We of Superbia Belt extend our warmest welcome to all humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Even if they do stand against the very Truth of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>That's not a very warm welcome at all, Shahel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>When you first met me, you were much more polite and gregarious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>And, wait, I was told you were eating! Now I feel like a fool for hesitating over asking to speak with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>When I first met you, I didn't yet know of your disposition. If I had, I'm certain my greeting would have been more...apropos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>As for eating, I was. I've taken the liberty of having meals prepared for you both as well, so please do feel free to partake at your leisure. Particularly you, Quence. You've gotten skinny, and it worries me so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir. I'm—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>A citizen of the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I can tell simply by...let's say, the look of your magil. Furthermore, you have the cores of Cursed Beasts embedded in your being, which means...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You're the Vessel of Purification, are you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Yes, that's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>How fascinating. The Vessel of Purification. The sacrificial daughter...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Come here all the way from Gula Belt. Why, I wonder?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Though perhaps it would be best for me to ask you this first:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>How is it you possess the core of a Cursed Beast which has yet to be felled?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Because I hail from the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>So, the Observer has gone, then. Which must mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Can you at least try to act a little more surprised?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>There was always a chance for such eventuality once the Ceremony of Creation had reached its final stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>But if she isn't taken care of soon, things could become most troublesome indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>She's the root of the dragon technique that binds this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Her continued existence only means the guaranteed failure of the Ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I've come to take over that Ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>(Her eyes are filled with such resolve... Just how deep does that resolve run?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>You have, have you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Yes. Am I not a satisfactory candidate for the role?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Regrettably, I am not the person who decides that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Only one who has successfully conquered all the Cursed Beasts has the right to carry out the Ceremony of Creation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>For only one with the power to exert control over the world itself can lead the charge on its remaking, as you may well imagine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>But as far as I can see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>You are not a warrior, nor do you possess any outstanding abilities. You are simply a formerly empty vessel that absorbed the cores into your being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>You are not yet prepared to fight against fate itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I know. And that's exactly why I came here to Superbia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I do not possess the wisdom needed to overturn the world's order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I have neither the skill to discern the nature of the universe, nor the aptitude to alter it. And yet, despite that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>If I were able to defeat the Beast of Pride as I am now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Would that not mean I have earned the right to change this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Oho!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>You are quite the fascinating one indeed, girl. I can see now why you picked her, Quence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>But I believe you have an ulterior motive. You didn't actually come here with the intention of taking over the Ceremony of Creation, did you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>What makes you say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Because all of this was prophesied—described in a most heinously accursed foretelling left behind by the one regarded as the priestess of Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Besides which...you do not have the eyes of one determined to make change, but rather of one who is resolved to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>You wish for this world to continue as it has always been.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>You want to keep the Truth of this world unchanged, even sealed as it is in corruption alongside all the world's people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>You understand, don't you? Your goal is in complete defiance of ours. We wish to rebuild this world from scratch, while you wish to preserve it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Are you planning to stop me, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Oh, certainly not! Your voice joins the chorus of those from all the Belt Regions, and the wishes it proclaims are no less valid than any others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I have no intention of nipping that bud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Then what is your intention?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I am only here to oversee things so that the past splendor of the dragons, and the world they left behind, can be passed along to those who may help bring it to flower once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Though I do so wish the humans would simply accept the fact that everything must be sacrificed, and move on already...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>How can we accept that, when the Infinite Serpent has done nothing to explain any part of it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>We've toiled endlessly—blindly—all just to barely grasp the faintest of answers without even a hint of assurance if they're actually true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Yet you tell us to accept those answers on, what, faith? What gives you that right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Most unfortunately, I am not a god. I am far from almighty, and am limited by much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>There is no way for me to save everything and everyone...which is why those who are unnecessary must be cast away, and that which is excess must be disposed of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Only then can I entrust everything I have to whatever remains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>And who gets to choose who or what remains? Do you spare no regard for the feelings of those who are destined to be sifted out and discarded through little more than your own selfish choices?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I could say the same for you. You can't possibly believe that no one will be hurt by your decision to sacrifice yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Life is built upon a foundation of sacrifices. The mere act of living is but a constant fight for the resources to continue living!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Take eating, for example. Food is a wondrous thing, and humans have both a biological need and an instinctive drive to eat. One could even think of food culture as a sublime art all its own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>But at its very core, consuming food is the act of taking life from others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Day by day, we continue eating to survive, to nourish, and even to enjoy. But have you ever stopped to wonder just how many sacrifices have been made in the name of consumption?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Your point is noted, but you can't deny that my wish to save everyone is a noble cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Certainly. But that's not truly the cause you champion, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Use your own words to refute me. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear; tell me what you truly feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>What is it you truly wish for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>I don't have much longer for this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>I was born as the Vessel of Purification, and my body has already been wrought by an incalculable amount of corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>I cannot hold out to the end of this journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>I see. And?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>I want to leave something behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>For the people I treasure... For my brother... I want to leave behind a world as beautiful as the one he envisions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>And if I can fulfill that vision through this feeble shell that's destined to break apart regardless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Then that's exactly what I intend to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>I understand now. Your ultimate goal, it would seem, is to denounce the Ceremony altogether.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Yes. Once it begins, countless aspects of this world will change, and many lives will undoubtedly be lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Naturally. The very laws of the world—the Truth, as we know it—will be rewritten from dust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>There will be no small number of casualties, and many beyond that will be forced to abandon their lives as they've known them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>And what you're saying is, you wish to save even them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Yes, for they are all a part of this world that I've loved so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Then I'm sure you're aware that the Infinite Serpent must stop you. You leave us no other choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>I am aware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>But you are merely a single person. Even if Quence should be foolish enough to join you, that would make two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>You're rather lacking in manpower for a siege upon the enemy's stronghold, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>You must have known I would oppose you. Which begs the question, how are you planning to get out of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Are you ready, Quence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Ready as I'll ever be, Boss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Oh, Quence. You really are planning to betray us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>I don't expect you to understand, Ignacio, but all I'm looking to do here is save the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>How I get there, and what form it takes, doesn't matter. I'm just following my heart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Pity. I thought you were going to say you did all this to save a girl. At least that would've sounded cool on your memorial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Well, she is my world now, so it wouldn't be wrong!</td>
</tr>
