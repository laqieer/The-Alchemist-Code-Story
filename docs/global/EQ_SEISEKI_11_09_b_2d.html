<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I am duly impressed. I should have expected as much from such elite soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Heh... Well, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Waginau, I leave this place to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Do you have somewhere better to be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I do. After all, who better to definitively end a war than the Lion Monarch himself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I shall retrieve Northern Pride's Sacred Stone with my own hands and secure the path to the tower that will lead to complete dominion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It seems that all is going according to plan. I will await the good news.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hehe... Hahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Captain Othima and Captain Seida... Dead?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Aahhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That is what I heard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>As far as I know, they were killed by Sol's hand on a battlefield in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I-it can't be... Those two could never...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>By now, the Lord Commander Kanon should be finished as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There is no need to grieve. I am here to ensure that you will meet them on the other side as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Goodbye, false knights. Bionic Eye Unseen!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Aahhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wh-what are you doing?! It's pointless to rush forward so recklessly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Kazahaya, please... We will do whatever we must to keep her at bay! Go to the Lord Commander!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You are doing this to cover me?! I cannot just leave you behind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Lord Commander Kanon's safety takes precedence over all! Please, Kazahaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>N-news from the royal palace! The enemy has made their way onto the palace grounds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>They what?! When did they break through the front guard?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>N-no, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You're not bad to have made it this far, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This is as far as you go! As long as I breathe, I will never let you get by me, Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Miuna! Behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What...? Seriously?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Miuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...! What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It seems the most effective way to destroy these is to aim for the head. Keep that in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>A-ah. Thank you. Nice work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Just as reckless as ever, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What did you call me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa... Kanon... You're alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Kazahaya! How is it out there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The Veda Templars have made their appearance, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Haaa... That's not important! The royal palace has been breached!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The royal palace?! Suzuka... She should already be there, backing up the Imperial Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That information came straight from the Imperial Guard! They can't keep up with the onslaught!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What?! How many enemies are they facing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That's the thing! Apparently it is just one warrior with an overwhelmingly dark aura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Just one warrior?! How can one man wreak such havoc?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Apparently, he has the ability to command a terrifying power that allows him to attack without lifting a single finger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It is the Lion Monarch Orion! He rode forward on his own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>This is bad... Is the Sacred Stone Lucifer still in the Emperor's custody?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yes... W-we have to hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hm...? Where is Zehn...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I can't believe it... Zehn, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Th-the Templar from earlier?! Wh-what of the knights that were fighting you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It is my turn to ask questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Kanon, behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Just how many of my comrades will you take from me? This is beyond the point of forgiveness! "Crumbling Armor" Hand!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>As I said before, as long as I breathe, I will not just let you do as you like!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>And I will certainly not let you lay a single finger on Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Miuna! Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>What are you still doing here? Go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>We will hold her off. You have somewhere to be, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Listen to them, Kanon. The Sacred Stone must be your priority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Fine... Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I shall not permit you to escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You don't seem to understand the situation. This is the end of the line for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>?! Be on your guard, Miuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Ack...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You think you can stop me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?! She disappeared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Grk...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Spica?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Good luck with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Wh-what is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>N-no... This is terrible... All of these people were taken down by just one...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hey...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...Uggh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Suzuka!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>M-Mistress... O-Orion is...still...in the palace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Don't speak! You need a medic, badly! Save your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Mistress... P-please... You must... Orion...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>...! She's... She's passed out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Orion...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>H-he's here! I-it's really Orion...! Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Emperor of Northern Pride and ruler of the continent of Babel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I, the Lion Monarch, have come to take the Sacred Stone Lucifer and your lives!</td>
</tr>
