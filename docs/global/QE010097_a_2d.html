<td>The Holy Guard are pursuing us at a tremendous speed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>They seem to be in quite a hurry. Well then...we part ways here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh...?! W-wait! We told you we'll persuade—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No, it's all right, Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If we encounter the Holy Guard and the Lizard Brigade is present, it will likely result in a conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It would be better if we split up and you headed to Valderik. I'm guessing that's what you had in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...Well, something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The road ahead is still long. It doesn't hurt to have fewer victims.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I want to ask you one thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Your words... Can I perceive them as the remarks of an honorable knight of Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Do you think I'll try to run away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I told you... We're traveling with you, our sworn enemies. We're also determined in our actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well... Not that my words matter if you can't believe me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I, Zeke Crowley, Captain of the Blue Flame Guard, respectfully accept your proposal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>B-but father...! If we move separately, it will put them in further danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I learned this from traveling with them, but they are strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>They also possess the strength to live by their beliefs and to be undaunted by anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Do not worry, Agatha. They will keep their promise and show up at our meeting location. As a fellow knight, I believe this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Father...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I see. So this is Zeke, the hero of the Kingdom of Envylia. I better understand now why my predecessors struggled against you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Sabareta, the next time we meet will be at the seat of peace negotiations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Make sure you get there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Right back at you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't let your guard down. Those negotiations will only matter if you are present there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Father! Sabareta!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>As if responding to Logi's voice, Agatha, whose face had been lowered in thought, suddenly looks up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Father! I will accompany the Lizard Brigade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Agatha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm certain that Dias will draw his sword if he encounters the Lizard Brigade. It's my role to stop that from happening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I promise I will protect you the people of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Father, please allow me to go—for the sake of bringing peace to the continent of Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I doubt you would listen even if I tried to stop you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>My apologies, Sabareta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The inadept Lizard Brigade accepts the young lady as our bodyguard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Father! Sabareta!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Agatha, you better not push yourself too hard, okay? Let's end this 20-year conflict between Envylia and Wratharis together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Logi and Agatha grasp each other's hands firmly and convey their determination.</td>
