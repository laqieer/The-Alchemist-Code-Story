<td>...Tina, are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes...I've been thinking all this time...about the meaning of Tehre's words...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Do you mean what he said about Asena's death serving the future of Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Is Beelzebub truly in Asena's possession?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It is. In its current state, Asena's power is what is suppressing Beelzebub's force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But then...if Asena dies, isn't it more likely that Beelzebub's power would go on a rampage throughout the land?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's true that we still lack power...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That being said, if we work together, I'm sure we can accomplish this task. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I know. What is Tehre thinking...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Even if we rack our brains over it, I doubt we'll find the answer. We must overcome this trial at all costs...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Let's make our way to Asena!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>How can the future you want...be that of Asena's death, Tehre?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You wouldn't understand...not with the knowledge you currently possess. Here is my one condition I propose to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If you wish for me to attend the Sprite Trio Discourse, you two Wind Shamans must go to Asena...and obtain a token.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A token...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Why just the two of us? So much is unclear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If you wish to refuse my proposal then so be it. I will not attend the Sprite Trio Discourse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We did not refuse your request, rather we wish to know the reason behind it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Which you will learn when you accomplish it...and the reason why I believe Asena must die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>A token...?! You wish for these two to complete the trial? Is this all a game to you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I dislike games. You are unaware of Asena's current state; that is why you can voice such protests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You know nothing. You continue living in past memories of this land. How can you not realize this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...Enough, you brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Please, wait! Tina and I will head to Asena and retrieve this token.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If that will ensure your attendance at the Sprite Trio Discourse, then we will go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>However, what is this trial that you are referring to, Fuu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It is the trial one must undergo to become a Sprite. Only those who overcome it are gifted with a token from Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What awaits one who fails to complete this trial...is death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Only one who manages to defeat one's own darkness can obtain a token.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Are you prepared to do this? If so, show me with your actions. Show me that you truly wish to save the future of Saga!</td>
</tr>
