<td>Agh...let's get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>G-got it...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Phew. After having been away awhile, I return to this country to find it in disarray.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Man, you're strong! You saved me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No need to thank me. Besides, a man of your strength wouldn't have needed help in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I acted unnecessarily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No, not at all! With that many of them surrounding me, I was trembling inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I see. I don't know where you are headed, but traveling alone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ever since this country was invaded by Greed Dike, those like the ones we've just encountered have been swaggering about this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm sure you will encounter more attacks up ahead. You should prepare yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I wasn't planning on going anywhere in particular. I'm a carefree merchant. I just came to buy some of the rare items that Wadatsumi has to offer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A carefree...merchant...is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah! Tsk...ouch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hm? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Seems like the guys just now gave me a little cut. Ah, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Here. Show me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No, it's just a scratch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's best not to underestimate scratches. Here. Use this medicine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I've never seen this medicine before. Is it from this country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I made it myself. Don't worry. It's medicine I learned from abroad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ah...learning medicine abroad, huh? Whoa...this medicine stings...! Oww...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Bear with it. Pain is proof of life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No doubt about it. Not only did you help me, but now you've given me medicine. I owe you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No need for that. Actually, you said you were a traveling merchant, didn't you? I have a request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I want you to create a paper on the method of creating this medicine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You can take that and give it to whatever medicine shop you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Gladly, but what kind of medicine is this? Did you create it yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's a special medicine that heals Demon's Blood. I was given it in a foreign country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I wrote down the method of purification. I've examined it and came up with the best ingredients to purify it within Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Demon's Blood...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes! With this, those suffering in this country can be saved!</td>
