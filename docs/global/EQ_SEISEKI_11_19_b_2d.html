<td>This is the end of the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I will take your lives as penance for stopping me, the Lion Monarch, from fulfilling my destiny! Divine Thunder Apocalypse!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Justice is on our side! Let's go, Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes! We will protect the future of the world! Shining Holy Judgment!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Go, Kudan! Take advantage of the strength you've gained by sacrificing all you once held dear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Of course! Orion, I will show you that the one who will lead the charge into the future is me! Therefore, I have a responsibility to stop you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Dead the End!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Emmel... Please help me give these heroes whatever support they need! Rising Sun!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Th-they're matching my strength?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>E-even with the three of us, we can't gain an advantage over him?! Even though he didn't manage to resurrect Nimul?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>He's stronger than I could have imagined! If we can't somehow break through...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Now you see. With or without Nimul, not one of you will survive this battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This is impossible! How can he still have strength to spare?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I will admit that I am a little impressed that peons such as yourselves managed to get this far. However, this is as far as you will ever get!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Th-this is bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I-I still...have one last trick up my sleeve. What follows is up to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Don't tell me...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Grraaaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What?! You—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Kudan, stop! The darkness will consume you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It doesn't matter! If we don't stop him here, then... Gnrk... Grahhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Urgh! I didn't expect you...to have this kind of strength remaining.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So close! If only we had just had a little more strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>W-we do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We have that strength. S-since we've already come this far, it's time for me to use my final trump card.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Kanon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>A-armies from the other countries are already making their way here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If we can just bring Orion down, then Greed Dike's chain of command will collapse and we should be able to take them out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We need to focus on what we can do now. We must put everything on the line to defeat Orion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You're sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes. I will do anything to save this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You have come far from the clumsy new Paladin who joined our ranks. Now, you are a splendid Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Wh-who do you think you are, to look down on me?! The Lion Monarch will not be made a fool after coming this far!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>He's certainly not going to make this easy for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Don't be so difficult, Nimul! I have done all of this for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Burning Seal!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm not like you. I am no chosen one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Her strength is different from before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Unlike you, I was never given a distinction like being a Vessel of Reincarnation or anything like that. I'm not that special. My role in this world is not one of revolution or destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>However...I cannot just give up. There is no excuse for me to lay down my sword when my duty is to stand up for the people of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wh-what are you doing?! Nimul, why?! Why have you abandoned me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I understand that there are those who have suffered because of the hand fate has dealt them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It makes sense to me that you want to end that cycle of pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>However, the answer is not to believe that all humankind is worthless, as you do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>We cannot build the future based on the unhappiness of the past!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The future will not be decided by you, nor by alchemists from the past, no matter how powerful! Even if they are weak, even if they are few...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The future of this world must be built upon the hopes of those who live in this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ngh... Arrrrrgghhhh! Huzzaaaaaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I will not let you! Huzzaaahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Nnghhhhh... Gwa...gwaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ngh... Nnnnnnrrrrgghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>This attack...is the world's answer to you, who looks down on mankind's will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ngh... Hrrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Brave Innocence!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ngh... Grrrrrrarggghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>This c-can't...be...! The Lion Monarch won't be beaten by the likes of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It is mere humans like us who must open up the path to the future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Ngh... Hrgh! Wh-why?! Nimul! Why don't you...help...m—Aaaaaaaaaaaarrgggghhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You...f-fools. I-I was chosen...by fate. The...Lion Monarch...will not meet his end...like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa... Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Kanon, you did well. That was an excellent attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It probably wasn't just me...or just us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>At the end, Excalibur let off some dazzling light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It was like...Emmel's soul had nowhere to go, so it rested inside Excalibur for a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Then, i-in the end, it was Emmel...who brought my ideals...to naught.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>No. It was the will of all mankind that called upon Emmel's soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Your ambitions were thwarted by the will of all the people in the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Ngh... If only you...had been born in another time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Time is irrelevant. So long as mankind's justice lives on, your ambitions will not be allowed to succeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You've...both grown...to be such fine knights. I'm so...glad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Zain, your body is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Nimul's resurrection has been thwarted. Emmel's power is fading from existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The rest...is up to you... Th-those of you who still live in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>O-our mission was purely...to stop Nimul's resurrection. That power which defies human understanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>From here on out...it is up to those of you who will live in the future...to define what justice truly is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Z-Zain... I understand now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Captain Kudan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Your generation...desires a peaceful...future for mankind...m-more strongly than anyone I've known. I can now...truly...rest in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Lord Zain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I am proud...to have lived in the same age as you two. I leave...the f-future of mankind...in your capable hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Lord Zain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You understood me...more than I realized. Forgive me for being so short-sighted. I'm in your debt, Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>And now... This is the last stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ready, Kanon? Let's settle this once and for all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
