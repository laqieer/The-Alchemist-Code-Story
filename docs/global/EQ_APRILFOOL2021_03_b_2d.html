<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Haa... Haa... Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>"Wratharis' Deadly Trio" isn't just a name after all. You guys can really fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Haa... Haa... Right back at ya, Neville.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Haa... Haa... Never mind all our bluster; when was the last time the three of us crossed swords like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It sure has been a while. Kind of takes me back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'd heard of you two, Caesar and Vlad, long before we came together as a trio, but still always thought I was the most suited to be our leader. I had so much confidence in myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I always thought the same of myself, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But once we got together and the fighting started, that thought disappeared. We fought as one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>For me as well, I never wanted to be the best among us; I just wanted us, as a singular unit, to be the pride of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It was never about showing off our strength to one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Exactly. Everything we did, we did for the land we loved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hahaha. That's it! That face... That's the Neville we all know and love. General Neville the Ice Snake, in the flesh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Cool and calculating, but with a burning passion for his homeland hidden beneath the surface—the kindhearted yet resourceful general who will lose to no one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Absolutely. This Neville could make people forget about any past blunders through sheer force of will alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>My biggest blunder wasn't being defeated in the tutorial, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The fact that I couldn't protect Wratharis to the end when it was engulfed in the flames of war... That is the deepest scar I bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>To make up for that failure, I will pick myself back up and hone my strategies, no matter how long it may take or how hard I must train.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's the spirit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But I can only put all my battle plans into action through the strength lent to me by that noble-hearted bolt of lightning...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>General Vlad the Thunderer, I owe it all to you. Going forward, will you still have my back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Aye, you can count on me any time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>And if you're not content with just me at your back, worry not...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Because here is the man whom I—or rather, whom all the people of Wratharis—can rely most heavily upon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Our great and righteous leader whose heart burns with fury for the sake of peace and justice throughout our noble homeland: General Caesar the Demon Flame!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But alas, even the combination of clever strategies, fierce generals, and warriors who support their country wholeheartedly from the frontline and rear alike was not enough to save our Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I blame my own lack of strength for that. I swear never again to turn my rage on you two in defeat, but rather to protect our shared dreams to the bitter end, with both of you at my side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Whew. Maybe it's because we haven't had this much action in a while, but I must say, I feel oddly invigorated right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I feel the same. It's almost as if some strange spirit has fallen upon us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>A spirit? Now that you mention it... Neville, I do believe you heard a voice earlier that neither of us could perceive. Are you...all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I am. I don't hear it now, but I feel like even when I did, it was on our side. That voice unleashed something within me that I believe gave us the push we needed to fight with all our might.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hahaha. Perhaps it was the voice of the player, as a collective, holding out for us—looking forward to our debut so much that they simply couldn't wait any longer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>In that case, why are we still hanging around here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, we've already betrayed the collective playerbase's feelings enough for one day, I think. For 307 lines of dialogue, in fact!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well, then, shall we go? Let's show the world the might of Wratharis' Deadly Trio once more! All for one, and one for glory! Or something...</td>
</tr>
