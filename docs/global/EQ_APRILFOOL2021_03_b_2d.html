<td>I'd heard of you two, Caesar and Vlad, long before we came together as a trio, but still always thought I was the most suited to be our leader. I had so much confidence in myself!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>

<td>The fact that I couldn't protect Wratharis to the end when it was engulfed in the flames of war... That is the deepest scar I bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>To make up for that failure, I will pick myself back up and hone my strategies, no matter how long it may take or how hard I must train.</td>

<td>That's the spirit!</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>But I can only put all my battle plans into action through the strength lent to me by that noble-hearted bolt of lightning...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Aye, you can count on me any time.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>But alas, even the combination of clever strategies, fierce generals, and warriors who support their country wholeheartedly from the frontline and rear alike was not enough to save our Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>I blame my own lack of strength for that. I swear never again to turn my rage on you two in defeat, but rather to protect our shared dreams to the bitter end, with both of you at my side!</td>

<tr>
<td>Vlad/Neville</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>Whew. Maybe it's because we haven't had this much action in a while, but I must say, I feel oddly invigorated right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>I feel the same. It's almost as if some strange spirit has fallen upon us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>A spirit? Now that you mention it... Neville, I do believe you heard a voice earlier that neither of us could perceive. Are you...all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>I am. I don't hear it now, but I feel like even when I did, it was on our side. That voice unleashed something within me that I believe gave us the push we needed to fight with all our might.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>Hahaha. Perhaps it was the voice of the player, as a collective, holding out for us—looking forward to our debut so much that they simply couldn't wait any longer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>In that case, why are we still hanging around here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>Yes, we've already betrayed the collective playerbase's feelings enough for one day, I think. For 307 lines of dialogue, in fact!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>Well, then, shall we go? Let's show the world the might of Wratharis' Deadly Trio once more! All for one, and one for glory! Or something...</td>
