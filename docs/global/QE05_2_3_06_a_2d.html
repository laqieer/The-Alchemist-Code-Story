<td>Grow crops in the desert?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yeah, have you not heard? There's a band of mercenaries called the Sand Hawks working on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>They're saying plants can grow in the desert if done right. We all thought that was just some fantasy talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But hot-dang, they finally got some crops to sprout! It's the talk of the dunes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Then Hawk's will lives on...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hey, you... You knew Hawk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Speak of the devil, eh? Mister, you're in luck. This person here is the leader of the Sand Hawks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ah, yes. I have heard of you, though this is our first meeting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>My name is Kamui. I am the head of a guild known as the Fruit Peddlers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The courier guild working with Ryle, right? Hmph... I have been impressed by how your people always make deliveries on time, rain or shine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, that is our motto. Sandstorms are a different story, though, as you might expect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ha! You're funny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Now, tell me, good sir. What brings you to our little town? Peddling some fruit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Fruit, yes...but I have also been asked to deal with some monsters spotted in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Just you? You gonna be okay on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why don't we lend you a helping hand? I'd like to hear a few more details about how you know Hawk, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I...appreciate the offer, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(Wait... Perhaps...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well... If it is not too much to ask, the help would be welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yeah, sure! I just gotta check in with Balt... Ah, rats. He's out on some kind of errand. I forgot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Recently, the number of bandits targeting merchants from Envylia has increased, and so the number of wannabe mercenaries is way up. It's really inconvenient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The world has indeed become a harsh place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Seriously. Anyway, we'd better get this done before the sun goes down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hey, dude, you seriously set a brutal pace. I guess I should've expected that kind of energy from someone who works as a courier in the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>My work does require a certain amount of fitness, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Grrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Here they come!</td>
