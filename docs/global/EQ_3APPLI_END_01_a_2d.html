<td>Oh? You are a human, yet you managed to come here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I am Ouroborosâ€”the observer of destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I acknowledge your determination for having made it here. What is your wish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I want to save Rena!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's quite an ambitious request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Let me see. In your current state, you should be able to open this door.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Go then, free yourself from your shackles, and fulfill your wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is goodbye. But, before you leave, I will tell you this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Beyond here is the world where the three worlds you have traveled to temporarily overlap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There you just might be able to fulfill that ambitious desire of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Do not forget what it is that you wish for. Now go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>No...I'm going to be consumed! Destroy...me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I will destroy the Rayvner! I will not let you die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Rena? You're not thinking of...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Please! Destroy me...destroy the Rayvner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What? Reality is distorting...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Why? When I am...at the end...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>When did I first become self-aware?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It feels like just yesterday, yet a long time ago at the same time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>In any case, I was on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I was alone, yet this was the only world I knew and I did not even know what it felt like to be lonely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>However...one day, a small hole appeared. A hole as small as the eye of a needle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Through that tiny hole, I was able to observe the outside world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>In the outside world, there were many people living happily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>There were different types of people with different types of connections. Seeing this created a hole in my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>For the first time, I felt lonely and isolated. Thus, I found myself wishing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>"I want to connect with someone."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I did not know that this was something forbidden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh? Just when I managed to successfully summon Haoumaru. Where did he go?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That juvenile one is gone too! What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Sakura! And Tyrfing! Both of you are back to normal! But...what is this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We seem to have been swallowed deeper into Rena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td><p_name>, do you know something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Who would've thought...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That small one had that much power?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It sounds like a far-fetched story, but...this situation is pretty far-fetched as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It looks like we've no choice but to believe you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>So...what do we need to do in order to save Rena?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So there you are. Let's end this quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If you're not going to kill me...then I'll kill you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No! We've no choice but to fight back!</td>
