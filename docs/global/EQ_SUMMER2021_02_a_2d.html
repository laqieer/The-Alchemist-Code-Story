<td>001</td>
<td>Have at you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Gaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Pfew! We took 'em all down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Blimey... I'd rather not be doing all this fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If not now, we'd end up fighting them later. We are all after the same treasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Even without knowing where the treasure is, it's not unusual for pirates to try to destroy their rivals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>All the ships seem to have a general idea where the cave should be, but no one is certain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's why all the pirates are circling the same waters. Oh... What do we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Even with Albea and the others handling security, if we continue on our current path, we're sure to battle more ships.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You're right. And if we make a misstep, we may reveal that we know where the cave is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That would make things very tricky. We best make haste there before that can happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Uh, umm...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes? What is it, Su Yi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well... I was thinking that we should keep on our current route, is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But aren't we sort of taking the long way around? Aren't we taking too long?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>W-Well, the shorter way takes us through the path of many more pirates. And this way, we can avoid a lot of conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>And to those that see us, we may appear to be retreating in fear, so they'll let their guard down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Besides... Given the current and the direction of the wind, we should get there must faster than expected!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Very interesting. What do you think we should do, Captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Of course, I place my trust in Su Yi. I've always relied on her judgment as our navigator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>She thinks through things carefully and chooses the best route, so there's no reason for doubt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Continue sharing your opinions, and I'll take responsibility for whatever happens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>O-Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, then... Steady the ship and onward we go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(I see...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Taken an interest in our captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I have... She puts her full faith in others, and handles things differently than I. It's very interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I suppose she does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The way you united the desert nobility is not something Xiao-Xiao could've done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>She is often rudderless and restless. When we first go to a new city, if I take my eyes off her, she'll disappear somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And when she does turn up again, undoubtedly she'll be in hot water over her personal sense of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That does seem quite...problematic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh, I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>She's the only one that can do what she does, so she's the only choice for captain of the Xiao Shenmei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(What only she can do... I'm not sure what that is. Not yet.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(But at least... Her crew trusts her through and through. It's remarkable.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I guess there must be a great many types of leaders.</td>
