<td>However, it still cannot withstand the curse. Low-temperature resistance alone doesn't seem worth the research effort.</td>
</tr>

<td>O-oh...</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Perhaps we selected the wrong material? The crystallized anti-curse effect seems to have been hyper-excessive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well, that's why we do experiments. Worst case scenario, we can discard the trial body.</td>

<td>There's no point unless the results accompany it. We're dabbling with the forbidden arts in order to create something that can resist the curse.</td>

<td>Who left the experiment cage open?! Quickly, separate the insects! How many times do I have to say this experiment is a secret kept from His Majesty...</td>

<td>Aaaaaaahhh!!!</td>

<td>How horrible. Are you all right, boy?</td>

<td>...Aaah?</td>

<tr>

<td>Who would've thought such inhumane acts were occurring within the royal palace?</td>
</tr>

<td>All right, there's no need to worry. Come on. Take my hands.</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...Uh...ah? ...A...dream...</td>

<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There's no one...</td>

<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There's no one there. It's okay. It's gonna be okay...I am living alone just fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>That sound...is maybe the rain? It's quiet and calming...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Maybe I still can't leave this mansion because it's like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That person said this place was safe...that, if I wanted...I could prepare to live in the village, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...I'm scared. Scared. Scared. I'm scared how they...how those girls...will look at how different I am...besides...</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Who would accept a creature like me that turns everything I touch into crystal...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ack! Seriously! Why did it start raining so suddenly?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ohh, my clothes are soaking wet... At this rate, I'll need to take shelter here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Um, hello...is anyone home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I guess not, huh? I mean, my mother told me that this mansion has been empty for a long...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Eeek?! Wh-wh-what was that sound?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>From inside the mansion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm just putting this out there, but, just now, was that a gh-gh-ghost...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(N-no, it can't be! Ghosts don't exist...said my mother never...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hello! Is somebody there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Eeek?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Aah, aah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Don't...come...I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...So beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wow! Your eyes are so sparkly! U-um, are you in this mansion by yourself?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Aah, um, yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I've never seen such beautiful eyes before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Be-beautiful? Are you talking about my crystal eyes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wow! How strange! They're not like my mom's, my sister's, or the people from the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hey, how can you have such beautiful eyes? Wow! They're almost like...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>W-wait...first of all, who are you? What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ooh...well, I just wanted some shelter from the rain. I'm sorry I entered without permission...um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'm Mielikki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>And, well, you know? I've never met someone as beautiful as you...that's why, well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Pl-please become friends with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...Huh? Friends...friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Do you mean, um...you and me...really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hey, look look! Celliers! I brought flowers today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Flowers...? Why did you bring something like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I don't think this mansion is very good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It's dark, damp, and stinks like medicine! If you stay here all the time, it'll make you depressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Really? I like this kind of place though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I know, right? Right? So I brought flowers instead! They're the most beautiful ones that I'm raising right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Raising? You're raising them, Mielikki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>In our village, I have my own flowerbed. I have one in the forest too but that one's a secret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>And there! There! I have lots of flowers that are in bloom during this season!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>This is a cut flower so it won't last long, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I see. So flowers blossom in this country as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Celliers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Oh, well...nothing., Thank you for the beautiful flowers. I'll decorate my room with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>The flowers...they became the same crystal as your eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Mielikki. I still can't control this power well...and now I've ruined your flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...It's so beautiful! Hey, hey, can you do it to things other than flowers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Of course. But...aren't you scared of my power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I feel a little sorry for the flowers, but this is already a cut flower and I do things like turning them into bookmarks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>That's not what I mean. You might end up like this as well...you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I won't, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Why's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>My mom would say to use your powers for something good. I'm sure you could do that, Celliers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Something good...my powers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Whoaa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>What's the matter, Celliers?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Ri-right now, there was a shadow on the table...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Hmm...a spider? There's a lot of dust as well...I think cleaning is important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I-I hate those...kind of things...! When they rustle around in the corner of the room, it makes me feel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You're such a baby. Here, little spider. Outside you go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Mielikki, are you okay with those kind soft things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Since I take care of my flowerbeds, I've seen lots of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I see. You're pretty amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Eheheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>We...are...going...outside!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Stop...don't pull me, Mielikki...I don't like the sunlight and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Today is cloudy so it's okay! I wanna show you my flower bed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>But if someone like me suddenly went outside and people saw us together, it'll be troublesome for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Why? I'd introduce you to all my friends, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>But...well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Come on! If you don't hurry up, it'll startâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I-it's raining...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Ahh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Aww...I'm soaking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I heard that rain is cold, but, looking at it like this, it's actually warm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>But at this rate, we'll catch a cold. Hey, can I use your shower?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Sure. You go ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>But then you'll get cold, Celliers! Let's go in together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Huh? B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>We're both girls so there's nothing to be embarrassed about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>No, no, you're wrong! There's a misunderstanding! Hey, wait, don't pull on my clothes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I've been thinking this from before, but you're surprisingly strong and...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Y-you're a guy...you're so beautiful, but it turns out you're a guy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Ack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>(It's already been a month since I met Mielikki...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>(A lot has happened...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>All right, preparation for the picnic is complete!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Celliers, what's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>No, I was just thinking about how eventful this month's been.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Really? Most of my memories are of you being locked up in that mansion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>B-but now sometimes I go outside, right? Although...I'm always with you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>And, today, we're gonna take a walk in the forest together! Are you ready?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Ah, yeah...is the flowerbed we're gonna go to far?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>It's really close. That first day I came here when I hid from the rain, I was on my way home from there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>All right then! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>O-oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Wow. I didn't know there was such an open space beyond that forest...besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Heheh I wonder if everyone is doing well today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Are all the flowers growing here yours, Mielikki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Yes! Some of them have strong scents or they grow too much, so it's difficult to grow them near the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>That's why I grow them in my secret flowerbed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>You did this all alone? You're amazing, Mielikki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Heheh... You think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Oh, but, but...recently I've been having some trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Trouble?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>With all these flowers, it's become a beautiful flower bed, but it seems like the scent is strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>So now I get naughty little monsters like those coming here and roughing up the flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Hey, don't come in the flowerbed without permission! Can't you see it says 'Mielikki's Flower Bed' on it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Unurruru!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>If you do something strange, I'll punish you with magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Mielikki, me too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>H-huh...o-ohhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>H-hey...I'm not there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Celliers? What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Aaaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>The earth and the leaves...are crystal now...? Celliers?! Celliers?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Hoo-hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>...! Oh...the monsters are after Celliers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>(I need to do something about it, but what can I do?! What?! This is my only option!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>He-hey, your fight is with me! I'm not scared of monsters at all!!!</td>
</tr>
