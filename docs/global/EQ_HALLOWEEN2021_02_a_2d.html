<td>But, it seems you were nervous talking to him.</td>

<td>If you're going on this main road towards the Ratty's nest, could you also look for him and help him if he needs some?</td>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/teti.png" alt="Tethys" height="128"><br>Tethys</td>

<tr>

<td>Yes. I don't like myself and I wanted to become someone special for others.</td>

<td>Tethys…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/teti.png" alt="Tethys" height="128"><br>Tethys</td>
