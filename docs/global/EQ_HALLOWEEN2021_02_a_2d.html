<td>A Ratty's nest? Yes, I think know where it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>R-really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Let me show you on a map. Hold a second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Good, good… Looks like finding where they went won't be a struggle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Tethys, I should thank you for suggesting we ask that peddler.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I thought it would be best to ask people who travel around the area. It's no big deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But, it seems you were nervous talking to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Y-yes. I'm not good at conversations…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting. See here? This circle marks where their nest is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Th-thank you very much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Alright! Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hey! Wait just a minute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Actually, one of my colleagues is supposed to be here but he hasn't arrived yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He's carrying goods for the parade and also costumes, so it's worrying that he isn't here…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I hope he hasn't gotten into any trouble along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If you're going on this main road towards the Ratty's nest, could you also look for him and help him if he needs some?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So…according to the map, the Ratty's nest is in this forest off the main road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And we should look out for the man's colleague.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Can I ask something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>S-sure. What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You don't even know that peddler. Why are you suddenly so energetic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>W-well, that's true, but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Because like me, I thought you wanted to avoid people…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But now you're wanting to get involved, so it's confusing to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You don't like talking to other people, so why do you suddenly want to help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's because…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>After seeing the sad reaction of that person learning that the parade might be cancelled…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>…made you want to become a real hero for him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes. I don't like myself and I wanted to become someone special for others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I understood what he felt when he said he wanted to change, and I want to support him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>…I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Is that…strange?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I didn't say that. But that's how you think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I thought we were alike… So it feels…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Tethys…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Nevermind. But we should hurry. Even if we get the costumes back, it won't mean anything if we don't return in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh…yes, right! Let's hurry… Wait, what's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Waaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>An attack by bandits? Let's go!</td>
