<td>Captain! The Holy Guard are approaching!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Is it Dias? Father, will you cross swords with him again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Dias may have taken on the power of darkness that lies beyond Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If that's true, then it will be difficult to avoid conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The power of darkness? What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It is when one sacrifices their body to the darkness in order to obtain a cursed power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>When our swords crossed earlier, I caught a glimpse of that power inside him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>A cursed power...?! Is Dias all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Before I could step into the darkness, I found you. Thus, I was able to stop myself from entering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What is beyond that is unknown territory to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh, Dias! Why would you meddle with a power like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It was my naivety in allowing Dias to use Alchemy that gave birth to this situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>In order to minimize casualties, I'll need to stop him with my own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Father, you can't mean...?! Please! Re-think this! At least spare his life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Dias has merely forgotten who he is! Please, spare him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You seem to have misunderstood something. I would never do something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm simply going to stop him. I have no intention of taking his life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Father!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's a parent's responsibility to correct their child when they follow the wrong path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>For me, all of you are my irreplaceable children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Have you forgotten the memories we've shared together as a family?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Time is the most important thing when it comes to family. The path we've walked together is a far stronger bond than any bloodline can be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We as a family have that, don't we? Our bond will not easily collapse, so there's no need for senseless worrying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...Okay!</td>
