<td>You are being offered this commission out of respect for your reputation as the Ultimate Blacksmith. We are prepared to pay handsomely—even more than you were previously promised!</td>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eiza.png" alt="Eizan" height="128"><br>Eizan</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Besides, they seem to really value your skills.</td>

<td>I understand your point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eiza.png" alt="Eizan" height="128"><br>Eizan</td>
<td>However, I did not become a blacksmith to make money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eiza.png" alt="Eizan" height="128"><br>Eizan</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>You need a reason?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eiza.png" alt="Eizan" height="128"><br>Eizan</td>

<td>That's it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eiza.png" alt="Eizan" height="128"><br>Eizan</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eiza.png" alt="Eizan" height="128"><br>Eizan</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eiza.png" alt="Eizan" height="128"><br>Eizan</td>
<td>That so-called title I've earned doesn't get to change my purpose. It does not define me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eiza.png" alt="Eizan" height="128"><br>Eizan</td>
<td>I continue to swing my hammer for the sole purpose of someday forging the Ultimate Blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eiza.png" alt="Eizan" height="128"><br>Eizan</td>
<td>Personally, I believe that's what it means to dedicate yourself to a craft.</td>

<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
