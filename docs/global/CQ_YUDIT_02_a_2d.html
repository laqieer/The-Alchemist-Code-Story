<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I...lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I mean...I didn't think I'd win easily, going up against the Ultimate Blacksmith and the weapons you created, but I didn't think it'd be so one-sided, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'd say it's half-baked, and that's me being generous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The weapon performs well, sure. But I couldn't feel your conviction as its creator through it. That's severely limiting its potential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Aw... Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But I don't get it! My heart's in this, one hundred percent! My goal is to make a weapon that can protect people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm serious about this. Really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Let me ask you something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Is that truly what you wish to create? A weapon to protect others?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh? Wh-what do you mean? Of course I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Lord Eizan! My apologies for the interruption, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh...it's you. What is it this time? I'm a bit busy at the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I do apologize, my lord, but this is an urgent matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I assume you're here to demand that I make weapons for your master's troops again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>My answer hasn't changed. Like I said before, I have no interest in mass-producing weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You are being offered this commission out of respect for your reputation as the Ultimate Blacksmith. We are prepared to pay handsomely—even more than you were previously promised!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We are even prepared to provide the rare ores you've been seeking as part of the reward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Would that not help speed your forging enterprise along?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's quite a reward you're offering. I'm sure you think it's very tempting, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I refuse. And my response isn't going to change, no matter what you offer me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>B-but why?! What if we were to double—no, triple your payment?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Money is not the issue here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Reproducing the same weapon over and over is just not something I'm prepared to do. It goes against everything I stand for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So, there's your answer. Now leave. Go tell your master that these trips are nothing but a waste of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hmph! Very well, then. I bid you good day, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Are you sure that was a good idea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why? Are you here to try to get me to mass-produce something as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No! Of course not. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Wouldn't those rare materials be invaluable to your forge? Can you really afford to say no to that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Besides, they seem to really value your skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I understand your point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>However, I did not become a blacksmith to make money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And I have no intention of doing a job I don't agree with for the sake of material gain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh... Okay, so why did you become a blacksmith, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You need a reason?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The same one that keeps me kicking, girl. I strive to forge the Ultimate Blade. Nothing more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But you've earned yourself a reputation as the Ultimate Blacksmith! There are tons of people who are desperate to seek out your work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>True. Many call on me in the hope of employing my skills, and I am always happy to oblige if it's a job I can agree to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But my reputation is simply a byproduct of doing what I live for, and I have no love for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That so-called title I've earned doesn't get to change my purpose. It does not define me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I continue to swing my hammer for the sole purpose of someday forging the Ultimate Blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Personally, I believe that's what it means to dedicate yourself to a craft.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What about you, Judith? What do you believe in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Before I answer that...would it be all right if I requested another sparring session?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I think... I think I can show you what I'm all about, now.</td>
</tr>
