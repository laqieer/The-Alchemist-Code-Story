<td>Sir Knight! Please, wait! What do you plan to do with them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What does it matter to you? The monsters have been taken care of. They aren't your concern anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Bu-but, the Wratharis soldiers also protected the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>As Dias smiles coldly, Logi and Agatha come rushing up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Dias! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You came just in time. Help me get these guys to talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey! Where is your leader Sabareta? Hurry up and spit it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Dias mercilessly kicks the Wratharis soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Agh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Dias! How could you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I-I've told you already! I'm not saying a word to you, you religious dogs! Hurry up and kill me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I see. In that case, I'll grant you your wish right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Saying this, Dias swings his sword upwards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Stop!!! Don't do it, Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Let go! Why are you stopping me?! They are the ones that bare their fangs at us. Are you trying to defend the enemy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You lot are always the same!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You've destroyed our kingdom and continue to rob us of our home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Our wrath has awoken a mighty power! Foolish Envylia... Your day of reckoning is at hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Shut up! Quit using your rebel logic to justify your heinous actions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Dias kicks the Wratharis soldier even more violently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Stop! What're you thinking, Dias? Even if they're enemy knights, we should give them medical treatment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hearing her voice, Dias falls still. However, dissatisfaction remains etched across his face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I-if it would be all right...I'd like to use this herbal medicine to treat them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes, of course. Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Logi? You too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The Envylia citizens bow their heads to Agatha and the others before they begin to treat the knights.</td>
