<td>...Looks like we managed to drive them off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Thank you, Reimei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's been a while since we've talked like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>... ...</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Why can't you look at me when you speak?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What are you doing here on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm practicing the traditional Wadatsumi dance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If I don't practice properly, I will lose my ability to dance properly for the gods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I guess that beautiful dancing is like a martial art; you need to practice daily in order to maintain your skill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You were dancing so beautifully it hardly seemed like practice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh! You were watching? I feel embarrassed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I was practicing here so that no one would be able to find me. I didn't expect to run into individuals like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I've heard that, lately, the villages around here are constantly being attacked by bandits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes. I heard that as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Unfortunately, with Wadatsumi in the midst of reconstruction, it's still far from a safe place...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes. This area is extremely dangerous as well. I'll escort you to the nearby village where you'll be under the watchful eyes of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Would it be problematic to be seen in the company of someone like me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Are you okay with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ye-yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(We're in the village. Ultimately, I wasn't able to say much to her.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Reimei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...Um, Reimei?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh? O-oh, what is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Would you like to get something to drink in that teahouse over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I can tell that you were tired even before you escorted me here. How about you drink some tea and relax a little?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's not much but think of it as my way of thanking you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>There's no need to thank me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Please. Don't be polite. Come on. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>There she is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Seriously? They've chased me all the way to this village?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What an annoying bunch!</td>
</tr>
