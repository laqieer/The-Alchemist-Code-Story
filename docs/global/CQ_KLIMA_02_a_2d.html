<td>This girl is dangerous! We cannot let her roam free! Call for reinforcements!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hold it right there!</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Annerose! You came to! Thank goodness!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>This girl is my responsibility as a member of the National Magical Research Department.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Whatever action you decide to take, it should be directed at me, and me alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's all well and good, but we can't just let her run wild like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Perhaps I didn't make myself clear. I am Annerose of the National Magical Research Department.</td>

<td>My father is Heinrich, the renowned specialist on modern engineering, and my mother is the foremost authority on the study of magic, Elfriede herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Their daughter stands before you, and is telling you that she will unequivocally shoulder all of the responsibility for this matter. Do you really intend to overlook this and get yourselves involved?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You're their daughter? Annerose, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You know something about her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm afraid so. Lord Heinrich and Lady Elfriede are among our patrons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I cannot ignore the words of their daughter. I don't like it, but at this stage, we have no choice other than to leave the girl be. I will be reporting this incident to my superiors, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Thank you for your cooperation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You ignored my instructions and caused a scene.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I don't want to see you here again until I have fully recovered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You are to stay in your village until that time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Unnghhh... I-I'm so sorry! Ungh... I-I'll be good, I p-promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Annerose... I hurt her, but she still saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>She probably hates me now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>She nags a lot, but she's always been really kind to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>She isn't scared of me, and she always looks after me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>She's taught me so much, about my powers, and about the city...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We were friends, but I... I've ruined everything. I was so terrible to her.</td>
