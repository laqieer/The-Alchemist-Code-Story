<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>That was so scary, them attacking us out of nowhere! I'd heard they were violent octopuses, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huh? There's tons of pots where those octopuses just were. Wow! There's stuff in them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>They're octopus pots. They gather their own treasure and hide it in the pot they live in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If the octopus pots are here, that means they're moving their living area from deep in the caves to the entrance. But why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Food scraps, pieces of paper, machine trash... How could even this cave be covered in trash?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I can't believe it. I can't even. I can't forgive this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Uh oh, Noah! Keep calm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Times like this, you've gotta keep calm. First, take a deep breath and then slowly breathe out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You want me to breathe?! O-okay... Ssss... Haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Keep breathing just like that. With your abdomen expanded, breathe out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And I want you to remember your most precious thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Right. I'm...trying to do my best for those two. Which is why I can't get angry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, I feel calmer now. What's this breathing technique?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's a breathing technique called deep breathing that's been passed down through warrior families. Good job not exploding, Noah! You did well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>N-no, I didn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ooo, what's that?! I don't know what it is but it looks fun! Albea, let's do it, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Albea, what's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I was just thinking about those Alkaroids from earlier. Their movements felt off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Is that so? I didn't even notice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I think that they're actually malfunctioning and being used despite that. If defective machines keep getting used, they deteriorate and get all kinds of errors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But being able to put out that kind of power even when getting used haphazardly while malfunctioning is something only machines can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>They can hurt people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The person commanding them to hurt people is evil. I know that. But even still, it's the machines that are the physical aggressors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The machines that I fix and the machines that I make, someone might be using them to hurt people somewhere out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Um, Albea. The person using an object gives it meaning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No matter the intent of its creator, not everyone will use things as they were intended to be used. That's something I've seen a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But there's also people that use them properly. This has been my experience!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I agree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Machines might be a little different, but one example is how I've used and taken care of this katana that is my warrior's spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm very thankful for people like Albea that help in doing that. That's what I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Katanas are a tool that can help or hurt people depending on the user. Aren't machines the same?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I have something that I've been fixing and using for a long time, too. It's nothing impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But it's very important to me, so I'm really happy when it gets fixed... I sometimes cry a little at the shop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm sure there's loads of people like me that are overjoyed when Albea fixes their machines for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You might be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hey, Albea! Why did you become a mechanic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huh? Why? Well, my father's been teaching me how to work with machines ever since I can remember. Plus, I like it and I'm good at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That's why I decided to make people happy as a mechanic...just like my brother did in the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>When my brother I were still together, he used to surprise me with a terrible ventriloquism act.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It was a long time ago so I don't really remember it well, but I do remember that it was funny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I don't remember everything, but I do remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Th-that was such a moving story! Unnnghhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That was a wonderful story. I don't have a brother or anything, so I'm a little envious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Me too. Brothers are a good thing to have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It's not that great. I don't know what happened to my brother at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Only that he was an alchemist...and a cheating gambler.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ooo, a gambler! I think that's something to be proud of! My little brother is probably terrible at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Nyx is too serious to make big bets! But that's beneficial for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Nyx is usually too reserved, which is why people often miss how incredible he is. He's really, truly amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hehe. You must be very proud of your brother, aren't you, Mira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Did I say that? Well, Nyx really is awesome!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I do sometimes, just a little, feel annoyed at being compared to him, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>But I'm not going to lose to him! I figure Nyx is probably proud of me, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Proud, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(I wanted to make my brother proud.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(That's why I inherited Magbea and have been taking on lots of jobs. Still...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>(The machines that I fixed with my own hands might be being used to hurt people somewhere out there.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(Can I be a sister my brother can be proud of if I failed to consider that possibility?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Albea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Look! Over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Alkaroids are coming out in droves. Do you think they're heading back to the beach?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Looks like it. We have to stop them!</td>
</tr>
