<td>Chaaarge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You're not harmed are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm fine. Thank you for saving me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So these are the bandits. I can't believe they would attack here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Look, Chihaya! The map they were carrying has some sort of marks all over it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Those marks... Those are the places they've appeared so far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're right. Is this some sort of attack plan? The spots are all over, but none are near the fair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh? What's this cave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hm... It seems central to all the scattered marks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If we go there, I'm sure we'll learn something useful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But what could be the intent behind attacking all these various places?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You think they could be trying to confuse and thin out security? But to what end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>They're likely after the special wedding knives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You think that's what they're after?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes. The Felici ore wedding knives have been targeted before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Felici ore is rare enough on its own, and the knives I make from it often fetch a high price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Those at the fair are of the highest quality, so it makes sense that's what they'd be after.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I can't believe something made to bring happiness to others is the cause of all this chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, we shouldn't waste time here. I'll go warn the people at the fair to tighten up security.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I was intending to make my way there now to watch the cake cutting performance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That'd be very helpful, but...are you sure it's safe to go on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'll be fine. I'm not carrying any Felici ore with me, so they won't attack me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The bandits hideout is likely in that cave. Please, be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hm... Could that be--?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hey! Chihaya look at this framed picture. Isn't it adorable?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It looks like a wedding drawn by a child. Everybody has marvelous smiles!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Um, Shayna... This isn't our studio to just be looking at--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It must be a child's drawing of a wedding they attended. It seems like it really left an impression.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hey! There are a number of letters pinned to this corkboard over here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Someone wrote how the wedding knife made their ceremony any even more wonderful memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I wonder... Could this picture and these letters all be from people who were at a wedding where one of the knives was used?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Seems that way. It's pretty impressive! Imagine all these people feeling compelled to express their gratitude in letters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>All these heartfelt letters of thanks really warm the spirit when you read them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Everyone seems so grateful to have had such exceptional marriage ceremonies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Seems so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I can understand why the studio owner works so hard to craft those special knives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I've received a number of fan letters myself, and they never fail to make me happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's because the feelings of those who see and support me are coming directly to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Receiving letters such as these, you'd naturally be driven to work hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Let's go, Chihaya! We must be quick in finding the bandits' hideout!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes, you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Those letters were really lovely though, weren't they? They were so filled with joy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yes, the people that wrote them conveyed a deep gratitude and happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>In them, I finally understood why everyone is so passionate about the bridal fair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>A wedding is a celebration of life as two people who deeply love each other come together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(It's a happy embarkation different from the occasion where I saw the heart of the bride ignored.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That's why everyone wants to congratulate the couple. And why the fair staff and artisans are so dedicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That crafter was pretty impressive. Already making the finest items, but uncompromising in trying to improve for others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well, I won't be outdone! I'll just have to work harder to please my fans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'll need to be stronger and prettier... I'll have to fight in an even more appealing way! But to do that... Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>U-Um... Shayna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I just had a great idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I need you to do something for me! When our duty is fulfilled, teach me to dance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Y-You want me to teach you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yes! I've thought about this a while, and your dancing has a hidden loveliness I lack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Whenever you perform, it's so graceful, and I'm captivated all over again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Oh... I-I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If I add your dance skills to my movements, I'll be even more elegant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Then the fans who watch me fight will be even happier! So please, teach me to dance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Rather, teach me the secret of your hidden cuteness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Well, if it's to make people happier, I suppose I could...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Heh, you really do think of your fans' feelings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>But I don't know that there is a secret to it. It all comes from daily practice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>*Grumble* So what you're saying is that daily training is what matters just like with combat. Is that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Aside from that... Well... Whenever I perform I want those who see me to feel happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>When someone sees me dance, I want to put joy into their heart, even if only a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That makes perfect sense! You do your best for the fans, which is why your dancing is so cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Fans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>(Oh...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I love watching Chihaya dance. She has such a kind face and is so beautiful when she does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You can really tell she wants everyone to be happy, and when I see that it touches me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>(Mizuchi...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I did notice how everyone who watched me wore glad and warm expressions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>It was like they were telling me they knew I wanted them to be happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>So your dancing really did bring those people cheer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I guess so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>(I can't say everything I did was proper for Wadatsumi, but still...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>There were those who understood the important emotions I poured into my dance.</td>
</tr>
