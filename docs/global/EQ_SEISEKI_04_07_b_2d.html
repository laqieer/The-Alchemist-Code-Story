<td>Captain Yauras, about that story right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>How the late Captain Cadanova was your rival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes. He was. That man provided me with the sensation of complete defeat for the first time in my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>He made me experience it so furiously that I felt I couldn't beat him in anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It was a one-sided rivalry, but I chased after him. My desire not to lose to him has spurred me on to this day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Even with his ability to become Lord Commander...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>He gave that position to Lord Zain and always stood in the frontlines as Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I can no longer catch up to that back. But, still, I continue to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If I stop fighting for even a moment, I will never be able to win against him...that's how I feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Kanon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova tried to protect me, and in the act lost his life. If only I hadn't pulled on his leg...oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Seriously, you really are a naughty child. What did you learn from Cadanova?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Always discard hesitation, hold a strong heart. He used to say that a lot, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Kanon...no one thinks that it's your fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's quite normal for a Paladin to die in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Everyone lives under that destiny. Stop being hard on yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Captain Yauras.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If you want to become strong, then discipline and train yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Strength is something that should be achieved through hard discipline.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Didn't he teach you that it was dangerous to just seek power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes! It's true...he did say that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The search for power creates an opening for evil to enter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Captain Yauras...can I ask you one last question?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Was that maybe the reason why Captain Kudan wasn't called on?</td>
</tr>
