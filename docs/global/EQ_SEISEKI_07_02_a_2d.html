<td>When it comes to absolute power, mental strength has nothing to do with it. I'll teach you that now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Sounds good! Come on then; attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...! No...actually, I'll stop here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh?! You coward...what are you playing at?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Basheeny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hey, what are you doing, Basheeny?! Why do you have your sword drawn?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No...it's nothing. More importantly, I'm glad you're safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...? Who's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Who? That's Commander Kanon, Lord Commander of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh? Y-y-you're Commander Kanon?! Ah, um...my apologies!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ah...um...who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Victor...?! What are you doing? Why are you here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Commander Chloe...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Chloe...do you know him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He's Victor...a novice that just joined my Guard. What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I was worried about you, Commander Chloe, so I asked Captain Vettel to allow me to come here and help you! This is my memorable first mission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hahah... If you're croaking with fear on a rescue mission then you won't be much of a help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What did you say, you scoundrel?! Commander Kanon! Who is this guy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh...that's Basheeny. He's a trainee of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>A trainee...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. But his skill...far out-performs those of the average knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>His actual results in battle, in fact, far surpass the achievements of numerous senior knights as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's why I hired him. He now serves as my bodyguard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Bodyguard...?! No, please, hold on a second!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Commander Kanon, this guy is dangerous! He said that he was out to assassinate you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Assassinate...? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Exactly what I said! He told me himself that he's an assassin...didn't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes, I did. If she can't maintain that level of awareness, there's no way I can protect her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>About that...Basheeny is always telling me to be more cautious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh...?! No, but...that's not how he said it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Basheeny...are you using the power of darkness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Just a moment ago, I sensed a dark presence around here. Was that you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No... What do you mean by power of darkness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Is that the weird power I felt back there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...Stop talking about things you don't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Doesn't blaming someone else for your failures in battle go against your code of chivalry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Agh...! Bu-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No matter how skillful he is, he's still just a trainee! There's no way he can use the power of darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...Are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I am. After all, I've never felt the power of darkness coming from him when we've been together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I know he's easy to misunderstand because of his personality, but, ultimately, he's an honest kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Honest?! What about him is...owww!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Enough! Sorry, Kanon...we'll be fine here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh...? Fine here...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Chloe was injured in the fight against Spica.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Get her down the mountain and take her to a doctor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Injured?! Are you okay, Commander Chloe?! Why...why did you befriend her when she's the enemy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>She's not the enemy anymore. Thanks to her help, we were able to prevent this volcano from erupting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Without her, I am certain that this surrounding area would have suffered from tremendous devastation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Stop prattling on. Once the fight is over, we are all knights. There are no enemies or allies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>If you're going to call yourself a knight then learn to have a heart to help one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...! Commander Chloe, is this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>This is Captain Monzein from the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ca-Ca-Captain Monzein the Great Thunder Axe?! Se-seriously?! No way! It's an honor!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...You know about me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Of course! Captain, your code of chivalry is the very embodiment of the spirit of knighthood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Just the other day, I told someone off for calling you a "foolish boar"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...You didn't have to tell him that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh? Hold on. Does that mean...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Enough unnecessary talk. Let's summarize what we just discussed. We're being highly inefficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Inefficient! I know who you are! Um...you're Seida, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Huh...? Ye-yes, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>My mother is from Saga! I didn't think I would meet a hero that represents Saga here. It's a real honor to meet you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Th-thanks...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...I'm sorry, Seida. Come on, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Ye-yes! Oh, but...um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...Is there something else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You...are you really Commander Kanon's bodyguard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I already told you I was, didn't I? Don't croak on your way back home...little frog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You scoundrel...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Basheeny! I'm sorry. He's not a bad guy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. If he tries to do something, we're here to protect you, Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Hey, Seida!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Well, as long as Seida is there...you won't try anything stupid, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Seriously. Enough! I'm sorry, Kanon. Take care on the road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yes, you too, Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Seriously...I don't wanna have to say this, but try to put a little more effort into getting along with people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>...My apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>More importantly, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be waiting at headquarters, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I was sent to deliver you an urgent message, Commander Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>A message? Did something happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>We received word that Captain Kudanstein was sighted. It appears he's headed this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Captain Kudan is headed this way?!</td>
</tr>
