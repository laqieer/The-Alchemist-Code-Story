<td>Ack! My attacks are going right through them! How is this possible?!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No matter. If I keep hacking away, I am bound to do some damage eventually! Raaaaaaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Isn't this the same as the Trial? We're facing our own shadows, just like we did then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You cannot defeat us. We are the collective will of nature itself! Humans, prepare to be destroyed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They've vanished!</td>

<td>006</td>
<td>The core's stopped glowing, too. What in the world is going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hyaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Does this mean we need to find another way to destroy it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Dang it. We don't have time to regroup outside. What should we do?</td>

<td>Hey! Where are you going?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Even if we cannot destroy the core, Beelzebub must be holed up somewhere inside here. I must search on for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hey, get back here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So...what do we do now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The core's stopped glowing...and shadows have appeared to protect it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It really is the same as the Trial! Except...our attacks go right through them. What're we supposed to do now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hmm... There must be a way to destroy the core! For the time being, let's go after Georgios.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But the core's right in front of our very eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We can't do anything about it if our attacks can't even make a scratch. We should go after Georgios, while we think of a backup plan. It's more dangerous to keep our forces divided like this.</td>

<td>Hey, guys... What do think those are?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Glurrrrrrrrrrrp!</td>

<td>What the hell are they?! Humanoid...Jam?!</td>
