<td><p_name></td>
<td>I'm sorry! I just really like the Templars. They were so cool in the event, too. I guess it was a little different from the game, but in a good way, y'know?</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/kaya.png" alt="Kaya" height="128"><br>Kaya</td>
<td>Event? You have piqued my curiosity... But that will have to wait. We have arrived at our destination. This is TAC Academy's cafeteria.</td>

<td>Thanks, Kaya. Y'know, I'm so glad you were the first person I met in this world.</td>
</tr>
