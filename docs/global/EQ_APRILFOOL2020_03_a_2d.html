<td>Well, let's go find this mysterious transfer student, then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hmhm. You're by far the more mysterious one, if you ask me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(Kaya's teasing me again. Let's see if I can play my cards right this time...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh, really? Then are you interested in solving the mystery of this very mysterious transfer student?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hmhm. Just a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Perhaps you could start by telling me what you were trying to achieve with that incredibly smooth reply.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(Okay, I lose... Kaya's still better at comebacks.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Kaya's Affection Level Slightly Increased</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What the—?! For that? How does this system work, anyway?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Excuse me, do you think you could lower your voice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Now, now. Don't be a spoilsport. Schools are meant to be noisy; it's unsettling when it gets too quiet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh! You're Sharon and Toritoh, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You know my name? We haven't met before, have we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Whoops. You're right. I just... heard some rumors about you two. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Rumors? Hah. I suppose there are plenty of people who would talk about me behind my back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It was all good stuff, I promise! I've been hearing bits and pieces about everyone, because I've been asking around about the transfer student.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I mean the other transfer student. I'm a transfer student, myself! I thought it might be nice to have a chat with the guy who came before me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Right... You must be talking about Sol, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The guy who is even less social than I am? Who barely a soul has seen since he joined the academy? That's the guy you're looking for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I guess so. I was hoping we could be friends, you know? Isn't there anyone who'd know where he is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Let me think... I suppose Acht might. She's his childhood friend, after all. You can probably find her in the cafeteria.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wait, Sol and Acht?! Does that mean the Templars exist in this world, too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, that was awkward. Look, I understand the appeal of history more than anyone, but blurting out things like that isn't going to win you any popularity points.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm sorry! I just really like the Templars. They were so cool in the event, too. I guess it was a little different from the game, but in a good way, y'know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Event? You have piqued my curiosity... But that will have to wait. We have arrived at our destination. This is TAC Academy's cafeteria.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Thanks, Kaya. Y'know, I'm so glad you were the first person I met in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>More flattery? It's certainly nice to hear, but all I did was show you the way to the cafeteria.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Kaya's Affection Level Increased</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Anyway, you don't need to thank me. It's no trouble—although it's really not like me to do this sort of thing at all. I suppose this, too, is fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Fate, huh? Come to think of it, you don't talk much with the other students, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I want to focus on my research. Objectless socialization is simply an inconvenience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Listen... I want you to promise me something. I'll help you with your research whenever you like, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>When you need me, just wait for me there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh? Where?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The place where we first met.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, okay. Sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hmhm. It will make it feel more like fate, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh? Wait a minute... This isn't a cafeteria—it's a bar! There're even bottles of alcohol in plain sight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Alcohol? Don't be ridiculous. This is a school! Come on, focus. Acht's right over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Did you need something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yeah, um... I'd like to meet Sol—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hold on, hear me out. I just want to talk—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Not happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hmhm. Looks like you're in her bad books already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What did you expect? You don't just go up to a stranger and ask for a meeting with someone. That's crazy suspicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I just want to talk to him, though. Really!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>At that moment, you hear a loud rumbling noise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huh? Kaya, did you say something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That wasn't me. Sounds more like someone's hungry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Acht's gone all red and pouty! I think I know whose rumbly tummy that was!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I-if you give me something to eat... I'll consider letting you meet Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>So, now we're scavenging for food... Any ideas?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Maybe some apples?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Apples? That's a pretty definitive answer, but why apples?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I'm not really sure why, but I used to go looking for apples a lot... It felt like I could never get enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Why can't I remember? I'm sure there was a good reason for it... Anyway, the point is you can never have too many apples!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I have no idea what you're talking about, but at least we have a clear goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Right. Let's go find some apples!</td>
</tr>
