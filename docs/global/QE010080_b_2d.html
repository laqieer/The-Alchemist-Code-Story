<td>Huff...huff...! D-don't stand in my way, Sabareta! I need to stop that Demon as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Heh. Then you'll have to cut me down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>As long as I live, the flame of Envylia's revenge will not go out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'll use whatever means possible to take control of the Demon!</td>

<td>Logi stares at Sabareta for a while before quietly lowering his sword that is pressed against him.</td>

<td>Like Agatha said, the cycle of hatred will only give birth to sorrow. There is no point in killing you.</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You... So you spare me out of sympathy! You'll regret it!</td>

<td>What you asked me before, I wasn't able to answer it then, but I can answer it now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>What...?</td>

<tr>

<td>My generation will accept responsibility for the sins of the past. We want to atone by finding a way for us to walk the same path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What a joke! You can never erase the sin of Envylia committed against us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I know that it won't be easy!</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But...if two disputing countries were to help each other...</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We may be able to bring peace to this world!</td>

<td>Hmph! You truly believe in that pipe dream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Even pipe dreams can become a reality if you don't give up on them! If we believe and act upon them, I am certain that day will come!</td>

<td>As if prompted by those words, Sabareta returns Logi's sharp gaze.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Both you and that girl... How optimistic are you people of Envylia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>...Grroogh...grooo...!</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The Demon! I need to go save Agatha!</td>

<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>A reconciliation between Wrath and Envylia... Do you seriously believe such a surreal dream is possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If we don't do it, the world will never change. It's not a question of whether it's possible or not; we will make it possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Tsk. What a silly notion.</td>
