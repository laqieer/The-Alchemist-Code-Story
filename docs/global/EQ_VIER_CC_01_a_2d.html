<td>I love...sleeping. It just feels good. Don't you agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You like eating...ahem... Actually, I like that aspect as well. You don't understand? That's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's easy, I don't even need to get up. I can relax, doze off, slide in and out of dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I just lie facedown. Then no one notices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Even if you fake feeling good or fake being asleep, they fall for it, don't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's the kind of person I love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Someone who purposefully falls for it, knowing full well what's happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Will you listen to my trivial little story?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I really love those who listen with a knowing look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You should know, my company does not come cheap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Happy Nobody-Around Day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A momentous four-hundredth anniversary... As if I can celebrate that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm not lonely at all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>None of you are invited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's snowing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I need to make it through before it gets too deep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Are those...footsteps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Is that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Did a human wander in from a village? Or could it be...?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Y-you there! Please, run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh my...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(I won't make it! No! Not when I finally...!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Spark Ray.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wh-what the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Literally a bolt out of the blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Uhm... Good morning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Or should I say, a real shocker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Shocking indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hello? I was hoping to find my way home, but I seem to have gotten lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Where might I be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Your way home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, y-yes. Though I probably shouldn't say it too loudly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Shall I lean in? Where is your village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Well, I'm looking for—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Is there something you have to say about my ears?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Are you perhaps...a high elf?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You are too, are you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>My name is Ephylinde.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I've been waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What? For me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I don't know you, and yet... I've been waiting for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Fantastic! This is amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>This is like a dream!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Your Majesties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Y-your Majesties!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>How has your journey home to the village been?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>We heard you assisted our dear daughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I-I had no idea she was the princess. I am so sorry for acting beyond my station!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Indeed, I am Princess Ainanna of the high elven realm of Fairgreen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It is my greatest pleasure to see my lords in such good health! I am humbled beyond measure to have been escorted by the princess herself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You have been away from home for several centuries. This place is hidden within the mountains, away from civilization. It is no wonder you would be lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>N-not to mention how Lustburg has changed. I didn't expect the giant insects running rampant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I believe it was over a hundred years ago...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It was something the humans did that spawned those creatures called Vermin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>With them flying about, Fairgreen has been completely cut off from the outside world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Though travel between Fairgreen and the outside world has always been difficult, you are the first to visit us in over four centuries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Ephylinde, the stories you told me as we made our way here were very intriguing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Well, I may not be as eloquent as a bard...but if Your Highness wishes, then I shall tell whatever story from abroad you'd like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Mom. Dad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Mm-hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I think that would be splendid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Excuse me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ephylinde, how would you like to be my personal tutor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Y-Your Highness's...?! Y-you wish to grant me the honor of becoming your personal tutor...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Do you object?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>N-not at all! I have no job or home to return to. This is the best news I could have asked for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>B-but is Your Highness sure? I'm merely a vagabond, and I don't believe I'm qualified to teach—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>There is only you. You are the only one in this isolated village whom I can ask about the outside world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>But still, to promptly place a stranger beside royalty is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You have intrigued your princess and yet you dare defy me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>N-never! As you wish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I expect you to have much to teach me! I do not see myself tiring of your stories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>As Your Highness wishes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Hehehehe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>H-have I done something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You're way too square. You don't need to be so uptight, Ephylinde!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>S-square...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Exactly! And you don't mind me calling you by name even though you are my teacher, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Y-you may call me whatever you wish, Your Highness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Hehehe. Hehehehehe! Conversations are fun, don't you agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I...do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>It is a good thing to not feel so alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ephylinde! Will you compliment me, Ephylinde?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Yes, yes. Very beautiful indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Really? Of course I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Fairgreen... I remember it as more disorderly and boisterous. Now, there seems to be a unifying, calm sense about the whole village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>The whole village is working together for the greater good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Princess Ainanna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Hello.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Have you returned from repelling Vermin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Twas nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Oh no, it means everything to us! It is thanks to Your Highness's efforts that we can live so comfortably.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>O-oh, well, I guess I am a big deal, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Must you go fight them yourself, Your Highness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I am the only one who can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>There is a magical barrier surrounding this village, maintained by the royal family since ancient times. It allows only high elves through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Every so often, magic must be channeled into the barrier at the border. Only those of royal lineage can do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>And it is for that reason that we are able to sleep soundly at night. We cannot thank you enough, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Oh, it's really nothing. I've done it too many times to count.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>But you put yourself in harm's way for the village and its people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>No, no... I mean, it's just something that keeps our home safe and peaceful so it's pretty impressive and generous of me, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I believe you are worthy of praise, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Heh, hehehehe. You think so? I-I am, aren't I? Hehehe, heh, hahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Th-the princess has smiled! She's laughing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Her Highness is what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Our ever-exhausted princess has shown a smile?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Of course Her Highness is charming even when standoffish, but she is known to have the world's loveliest smile! We haven't seen it in so long, but she has finally smiled again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>We must celebrate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Come now, don't make fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>They adore you, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Don't tease me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I find it charming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Ephylinde, what made you want to go on a journey?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Why indeed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Princess Ainanna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>What do you think about the village now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Will you stay here forever?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>You are safe here. Nothing that will disturb your soul will ever happen here. It is a pure, uncorrupted world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>It's peaceful, quiet, clean, everyone is kind to each other... There is nothing to be afraid of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>A paradise for high elves. There are no foreigners or dark elves to threaten us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Even you, Your Highness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Even you are afraid of dark elves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>They can all rot, for all I care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Of course...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>The fact that they are self-aware proves how vile they are. Much worse than the Vermin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>It must be divine punishment that their lives are much shorter than ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>I cannot understand how they could allow themselves to make children knowing they will inherit the filthy blood of their parents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>There is nothing to worry about, Ephylinde. As long as I am around, there will be no corruption in this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>That is quite...reassuring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I just want everything and everyone to stay clean and pure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>That is my wish.</td>
</tr>
