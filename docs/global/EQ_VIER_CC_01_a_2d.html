<td>You have been away from home for several centuries. This place is hidden within the mountains, away from civilization. It is no wonder you would be lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>N-not at all! I have no job or home to return to. This is the best news I could have asked for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>B-but is Your Highness sure? I'm merely a vagabond, and I don't believe I'm qualified to teach—</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>There is only you. You are the only one in this isolated village whom I can ask about the outside world.</td>

<td>O-oh, well, I guess I am a big deal, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>I am the only one who can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>There is a magical barrier surrounding this village, maintained by the royal family since ancient times. It allows only high elves through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Every so often, magic must be channeled into the barrier at the border. Only those of royal lineage can do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High-Elf Citizen A</td>
<td>And it is for that reason that we are able to sleep soundly at night. We cannot thank you enough, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Oh, it's really nothing. I've done it too many times to count.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>But you put yourself in harm's way for the village and its people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>No, no... I mean, it's just something that keeps our home safe and peaceful so it's pretty impressive and generous of me, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I believe you are worthy of praise, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>

<td>Heh, hehehehe. You think so? I-I am, aren't I? Hehehe, heh, hahahaha!</td>

<td>Her Highness is what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High-Elf Citizen C</td>
<td>Our ever-exhausted princess has shown a smile?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Of course Her Highness is charming even when standoffish, but she is known to have the world's loveliest smile! We haven't seen it in so long, but she has finally smiled again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High-Elf Citizen E</td>
<td>We must celebrate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Come now, don't make fun.</td>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>Why indeed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>What do you think about the village now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Will you stay here forever?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You are safe here. Nothing that will disturb your soul will ever happen here. It is a pure, uncorrupted world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>It's peaceful, quiet, clean, everyone is kind to each other... There is nothing to be afraid of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>A paradise for high elves. There are no foreigners or dark elves to threaten us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Even you are afraid of dark elves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>They can all rot, for all I care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>Of course...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High-Elf Citizen B</td>
<td>The fact that they are self-aware proves how vile they are. Much worse than the Vermin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High-Elf Citizen C</td>
<td>It must be divine punishment that their lives are much shorter than ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High-Elf Citizen A</td>
<td>I cannot understand how they could allow themselves to make children knowing they will inherit the filthy blood of their parents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>There is nothing to worry about, Ephylinde. As long as I am around, there will be no corruption in this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>That is quite...reassuring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>I just want everything and everyone to stay clean and pure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>That is my wish.</td>
