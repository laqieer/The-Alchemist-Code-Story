</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Yes, it is, as a matter of fact. Don't you know it's rude to accept what isn't yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>It's too early, mama!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>And whose fault is that, Aya? We can't very well leave him hanging after that little trick!</td>

<td>Hmhm. You say such silly things, Aya, just like your father.</td>

<td>Summer is nearly over, and the nights are growing colder. I thought you could use something to keep your neck warm.</td>

<td>Papa, don't cry!</td>

<td>Really, now. Must you cry every year? The normal reaction is a smile, you know.</td>

<td>Hey! Don't dry your eyes on your new scarf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>There's no point scolding him, Aya. He's always been like that. He's hardly changed a whit in all the years I've known him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zenn.png" alt="Zehn" height="128"><br>Zehn</td>
<td>S-sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>No, no. Don't apologize. It's yours now, to use how you see fit. Use it to dry your tears or warm your neck—or both.</td>
</tr>

<td>Ready, mama? We've gotta do the thing!</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hmm...</td>

<td>At the end of the day, I'm still a coward, aren't I?</td>

<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>You haven't let go because you're afraid of losing us. You want to be ready to protect us at any given moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zenn.png" alt="Zehn" height="128"><br>Zehn</td>
<td>I'd do anything for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>But you should be able to let go enough to enjoy yourself on a day of celebration, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>I understand. Until just recently, uprisings were occurring all over the country, from the vicinity of Castle Aquila Rubrum to the outlying cities, incited by a lack of faith in the house of Rising Ashes' rule due to the economic crisis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>But now, thanks to the diligent efforts of our military—and the devotion of our shrine maidens—the fiery seeds of rebellion have at last quieted down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>And what flames remain aren't going to reach us all the way out here, in the middle of the countryside. We're safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>But you're not going to sustain any more injuries, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zenn.png" alt="Zehn" height="128"><br>Zehn</td>
<td>No. Not again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Good, because I can't use my healing powers anymore. And, since I left my family behind, I will never again be compelled to do so, by duty or anything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>It is thanks to you that I yet live, my darling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>If you hadn't changed your mind, all those years ago, I would not be here right now. You gave me a second chance at life.</td>

<td>Hah! Everywhere outside the capital is the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>They must be rebel soldiers, routed by the royal military...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Rebel B</td>
<td>Yeah! The resistance is on the move! We're on the verge of pushing back those royal-loving bastards!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Rebel C</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>I've heard rumors of this lot. They've been moving from place to place, pillaging villages and small towns, tormenting the local populace... They're an offshoot branch of the resistance.</td>
</tr>

<td>Keep your distance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Rebel A</td>
<td>Hah! Now that I get a good look at ya... You're a foreigner, ain't ya? You think you can use that katana better than a man born and bred in this country?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Rebel B</td>
<td>You must think pretty highly of yourself. How about you show us what you can do, outsider? Unless you're too scared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>You're the outsiders here, fool...and you should learn to pick your fights more wisely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Rebel C</td>
<td>The hell did you say?!</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>I am a poor mockery of a samurai.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zenn.png" alt="Zehn" height="128"><br>Zehn</td>
<td>Perhaps not...but I do know this: take one step closer and you will breathe your last breath. Leave now, and you will be spared. Remain, and I will show you no mercy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
