<td>Are you giving this ball to papa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Don't tell me you've forgotten what day it is today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Papa's so forgetful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>O-of course I haven't forgotten. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But what? Don't you like it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Aya, this is the ball I once gave Mitsu...your mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes, it is, as a matter of fact. Don't you know it's rude to accept what isn't yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Come on, Aya. Let's play ball!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I-I thought she was giving it to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Goodness... You're so impatient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yeah, papa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I haven't even asked for anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well...all right. I was planning on saving it for this evening, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's too early, mama!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>And whose fault is that, Aya? We can't very well leave him hanging after that little trick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I wanted to surprise papa first! Surprise attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hmhm. You say such silly things, Aya, just like your father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wh-when have I ever said anything silly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Here you are, dear. This is for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Is this a...scarf?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Mama and I made it together! It matches your sash!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Summer is nearly over, and the nights are growing colder. I thought you could use something to keep your neck warm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Mitsu... Aya... I... Thank you for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ungh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Papa, don't cry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Really, now. Must you cry every year? The normal reaction is a smile, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry! It's just...so...sweet! Ungh...hic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hey! Don't dry your eyes on your new scarf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>There's no point scolding him, Aya. He's always been like that. He's hardly changed a whit in all the years I've known him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>S-sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No, no. Don't apologize. It's yours now, to use how you see fit. Use it to dry your tears or warm your neck—or both.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ungh...hic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No more tears!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>O-ow! What was that for?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That was mama's surprise attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>See? I knew she got that from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hee hee. Perhaps...but I got it from you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ready, mama? We've gotta do the thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Right. On the count of three. One...two...three!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Happy birthday, papa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You had another nightmare last night, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Is that why you sent Aya out to play? To talk about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Of course not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I just wanted to be alone with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Well...yes. Sometimes I still dream about...how things used to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Before we came to Wadatsumi, you mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It's just...this peace doesn't sit right with me. No matter how many years pass, I can't seem to get used to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Greed Dike never did invade Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>But why? I dealt Orion a blow, yes, but it couldn't have been enough to stop him in his tracks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'd like to think that Orion reconsidered, but...I guess I'm not that optimistic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>At the end of the day, I'm still a coward, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You haven't let go because you're afraid of losing us. You want to be ready to protect us at any given moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'd do anything for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>But you should be able to let go enough to enjoy yourself on a day of celebration, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I understand. Until just recently, uprisings were occurring all over the country, from the vicinity of Castle Aquila Rubrum to the outlying cities, incited by a lack of faith in the house of Rising Ashes' rule due to the economic crisis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>But now, thanks to the diligent efforts of our military—and the devotion of our shrine maidens—the fiery seeds of rebellion have at last quieted down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>And what flames remain aren't going to reach us all the way out here, in the middle of the countryside. We're safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>M-Mitsu?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Excuse my cough. The changing of the seasons is always hard on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>But you're not going to sustain any more injuries, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>No. Not again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Good, because I can't use my healing powers anymore. And, since I left my family behind, I will never again be compelled to do so, by duty or anything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It is thanks to you that I yet live, my darling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>If you hadn't changed your mind, all those years ago, I would not be here right now. You gave me a second chance at life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I-I... Ungh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Please don't cry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I-I'm old. My eyes sometimes...leak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Oh, please. Don't blame your age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Well! Ain't you two a fancy pair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Who goes there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>People actually live here? Look at the state of these hovels! This country really has gone to the dogs...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Hah! Everywhere outside the capital is the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>They must be rebel soldiers, routed by the royal military...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>We didn't lose! We just moved the battlefield out 'ere at our own convenience!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Yeah! The resistance is on the move! We're on the verge of pushing back those royal-loving bastards!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Those cowards don't deserve the throne! We've been fighting night and day to kick them off their cushy seats, and we won't rest till they've tasted hardship like the rest of us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>So! 'As this village got a leader, or what? Someone go fetch the mayor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Whoever they are, they're in for an early retirement, 'cause we're taking over! Just be grateful you hicks get to do something useful in your miserable lives by helping the cause!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I've heard rumors of this lot. They've been moving from place to place, pillaging villages and small towns, tormenting the local populace... They're an offshoot branch of the resistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I've seen my fair share of their kind in Greed Dike... I suppose every country has its bad apples.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Oi! What're you two lovebirds whisperin' about?! If you're thinkin' of runnin' away, think again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Yeah! You'll be helping us fight the good fight against those royal-loving scum!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Keep your distance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Hah! Now that I get a good look at ya... You're a foreigner, ain't ya? You think you can use that katana better than a man born and bred in this country?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You must think pretty highly of yourself. How about you show us what you can do, outsider? Unless you're too scared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>You're the outsiders here, fool...and you should learn to pick your fights more wisely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>The hell did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Me? I didn't say anything. You must be imagining things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>What's yer name, foreign scum?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I am Zehn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>It is true that I was not born here, and that I am not at all adept at wielding this katana.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I am a poor mockery of a samurai.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>You dare call yourself a samurai?! You've got some nerve! You don't even know the meaning of the word!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Perhaps not...but I do know this: take one step closer and you will breathe your last breath. Leave now, and you will be spared. Remain, and I will show you no mercy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Enough talk! Get him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I hope you've said your prayers.</td>
