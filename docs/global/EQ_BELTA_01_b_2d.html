<td>Come on now, stop, please. There’s no point in doing this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(That huge sword little Sharon uses is way too disproportionate...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Thank goodness. I’m glad you understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Don’t get the wrong idea. That “I see” was me realizing that you had no intention of shooting that cannon towards me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why didn’t you aim it at me? You have such great skill, so it’s not like you’re afraid of hurting people, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No, that’s exactly it. I’d prefer not to hurt others. Never have, never will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh please. What do you have to teach me, then? No matter how skilled you might be, you’re useless to the knighthood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If you don’t fight, then how can you protect something? That’s what the person I admire was capable of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Are you talking about Nina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You’re not even prepared to hurt others. So what’s it to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I’ll seek approval from someone in the knighthood for me to switch instructors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...Since it doesn’t seem like I have anything to learn from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Enough. It’s time for your drills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I’m sorry, but I will be your instructor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Sigh ...Don’t you understand what I just said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hey, what are you doing?! We can’t leave without you! Hurry on over to the square!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Right? I’ve got some preparations to tend to, so head off without me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wow, the orchestral band sounds so beautiful, as always. Oh, Patty, Alaia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We’re just going to do some military exercises. Was it really necessary to call in the orchestral band?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don’t think such entertainment is necessary. This isn’t a parade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We are training in order to protect Envylia, not for someone’s amusement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Really? I think this is necessary. More importantly, it’s what the king wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The Envylia Orchestral Band was formed a few years ago, not to “protect” Envylia under orders, but to inspire the people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The fact that they were formed for that reason is a sign that we’re one step closer to peace. At least, that’s what I think... See, look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Everyone’s smiling from ear to ear! We fight to protect all of those smiles. Don’t you think that’s wonderful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Bertie! What did you think of our performance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Patty! It was awesome, as usual!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Right? Okay, let’s go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What? You’re coming with us, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It’s an annual tradition. The Envylia Orchestral Band attends the drills of the temporary assignment ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We have knowledge when it comes to battles, too. We’ll make sure to support you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Through the power of music, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I don’t think entertainment is necessary on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Of course it is! Music provides strength for battles. I’m sure you’ll understand one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What would a human like you know about me? Music just hurts the ears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...Um. Sorry, I was a bit too overbearing with the way I worded that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Little Sharon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hey, where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Please don’t make me say this again. Don’t call me “little.” Where I go is none of your business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Of course it is! I’m your instructor, after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I’m just going over to the site of the drills first. Besides, I don’t recognize you as my instructor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Now, if you will excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Oh, uh, wait! Hum. She really is a difficult one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It’s not so much that she’s difficult, but that she’s very harsh. Are you okay, Alaia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I’m sorry Alaia, Patty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I’m fine. So that was Sharon, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>She’s more of a handful than rumors suggested. It’s as if she lacks the ability to cooperate or something... With that attitude, she’d be a loner no matter which knighthood she joined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Bertie, are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I’m fine! I’m sure she has her own reasons for the way she acts, though she doesn’t need to be so harsh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I can sense a desperation in her, so I need to give her guidance. That’s my role.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I need to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What’s wrong, Bertie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>No, nothing! We should go, too!</td>
</tr>
