<td>Finally... Finally! I'm finally here!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>H-here they come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oi... Are you a friend of that blacksmith who lives outside the village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You here to take us over?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Stand back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>H-hey! Come on, now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Keep your hands where we can see them, or this won't end well for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Just hold on a second, will ya? The name's Adaleigh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I came here from the Acedia Belt Region!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>From the... Where? Acid...ear...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Why have you come to the land of the Sephira?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sephira...? Oh, I get it. So this place is called Sephira, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's really beautiful! Everything is so green, as far as the eye can see! Not a chasm in sight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wh-what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Do you guys get earthquakes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Earth...quakes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, occasionally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Come to think of it, I don't think there's been one for several years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wow! So you don't have to worry about earthquakes here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Then this really is the place! I've finally found a world free from sin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There is no such thing as a world free from sin. Not so long as there are people living in it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Who're you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>My name is Nimul. I am something of a leader to these people... To the Sephira. Well, I will be, soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I've been listening...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And I would like to bid you welcome, visitor from the other side of the Barrier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This is the Sephira Village: a withering land beset by the corruption of sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The Sephira Village...? The corruption of sin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Wait... Does this mean that there's a Cursed Beast here, too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>There is, indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Are you for real?! I can't believe this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I came all the way out here for nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I would like very much to speak with you. I want to hear about your quest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>And about the place from which you came.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>All right. I can do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Excellent. Well, Adaleigh, if you would follow me back to my home, I'd be more than happy to accommodate you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Sounds good. I... Ahh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Is something...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>H-hey! What's wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Are you alright? Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Snnrk... Frrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Is he...asleep?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It can't have been an easy voyage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>He had to traverse the Dark Barrier, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(The Dark Barrier... It is said to be a wellspring of corruption.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(Yet this man passed through it to get here.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(What does that mean? What is the Dark Barrier, really?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Nimul... What should we do about him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'll take him back to my place. He should feel better after he's had a decent rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hello? Hey! Where is everyone?! Hellooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What the...? No! Not another earthquake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Arrrgghhh! This is really bad! This is the biggest one...ever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>H-hey! Look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Urgh... Nnrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What the...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Fallen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Haaaarrrrgghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>N-no! Aaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Aaaahhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You're finally awake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>H-huh? Where...am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You collapsed, so I carried you back to my house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Oh, uh... Thanks. Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It seemed as though you were having a nightmare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Yeah, I... I had a terrible dream. It was about the place I came from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>There're all these chasms, which are just full of corruption...and in my dream, a man accidentally came into contact with the stuff, which turned him into one of the Fallen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The Fallen...? You mean to say that they exist in other regions?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I would like to hear more about the region you came from...if you wouldn't mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Sure thing. I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Oops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Perhaps you should have something to eat first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Seems like that would be for the best. I'll bring him something right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Ungh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Umgf! Hrmpf! Mmm... Umgf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You...must have been starving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Sorry! Umgf... Can't help stuffing my face. Never seen anything like this before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Make sure you chew, at least. Wouldn't want you to choke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Urrgk! Ooorf... W-water!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What did I just tell you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I guess he was just that hungry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Haa... Haa... I thought I was gonna die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Slow down. The food isn't going anywhere. Take it easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Adaleigh, while you eat... Take as much time as you need, but if you could please start telling us of the place from which you came...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>My home... The Acedia Belt Region... It was punished in the form of earthquakes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>The ground shook multiple times a day, every day. Big quakes, small quakes... They split open the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>And from those chasms came the corruption of the Cursed Beast. It bubbled up from underground, black and sick...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Shaken both mentally and physically by the constant tremors, terrified of falling into the yawning chasms... We lived amidst the corruption in a state of constant fear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>As I'm sure you can imagine, the Acedia Belt Region has none of the beauty and greenery of your village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>But I... I wanted to save it. The ruined earth, the suffering people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>So I built an airship and set out to do just that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>You...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>You made that ship?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Sure did. I'm an engineer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>An engineer...? Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>So... What was the purpose of your voyage? How did you plan to save your home and people with a ship?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I was hoping... I was hoping that there was somewhere peaceful out there, somewhere where sin wasn't running rampant and destroying people's lives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I thought that if I found someplace like that, I'd be able to find a way to improve our situation, even just a little!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>But it seems like that...isn't gonna happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>You're right, Nimul. Wherever people are, sin will find them. There's no such thing as a human utopia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Perhaps, but that is the way of this world. As it is now, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Well, I'm not gonna give up! This is only the second place I've been to. I'm sure there's gotta be somewhere out there thatâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>This is the second place? So you landed somewhere else before arriving here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Yeah, that's right. I've been to one other place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>According to the people I met there, it was called the Luxuria Belt Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>The Luxuria Belt Region...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>What was it like? I suppose that it was also burdened by sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>That place...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>It was frozen solid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>The entire region was buried in ice and snow. It was nothing short of a frigid wasteland.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>That's how the Luxuria Belt Region was punished...with intense cold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>You're leaving, aren't you, Adaleigh? It's a shame... I was really starting to like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Mira...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>You're right. I'm going. I need to find a place that's free from sin. There has to be somewhere out there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>That's why I built this ship... That's the reason I'm here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I know... I haven't forgotten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>You know what? I believe in you, Adaleigh! I know you can do it. I mean, time is infinite!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>C'mon, Mira... Not this again. Human time is finite. You know that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Shame on you, Nyx! Don't you believe in Adaleigh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>It's not a question of belief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Adaleigh... What you're doing is dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>It doesn't matter who you are. There's no guarantee that you'll make it through your next trip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>In fact, it's pretty much a miracle that you made it here in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>You think I don't know that? Still... If I have even the slightest chance of success, I have to try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>No... There's no "try" about it. I'm going to do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I know I can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Well... It's not like I had any intention of stopping you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I wish you all the best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Adaleigh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Oh, uh... Sorry. It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Anyway, I wanna hear more about this Sephira village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>You called it a withering land, but it sure doesn't look that way to me. Is it reallyâ€”?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>It is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>The only reason that the true state of this land isn't plain to the naked eye is thanks to the existence of the Tree of Life, Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Sephiron, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>The combined powers of Sephiron and the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg are what suppress the corruption with which the Cursed Beast assaults us from its slumber beneath the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>S-suppress it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>And the one who wields those powers is the priestess, known as the Vessel of Purification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Vessel of...Purification...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Is that... Is that really possible?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Indeed. Well, it is for we of the Sephira, who possess powers of purification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>So then... You mean the same thing wouldn't work for other lands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Correct. It would be impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>No. Not impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I am currently in the process of researching Spiritbonding, and with said research, I am attempting to produce an entirely new technique.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Spiritbonding? A new... Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Spiritbonding is the power of Mother Nature herself, of Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>It is an art native to these lands, and one that can be used only by the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>However, the new Spiritbonding technique that I am developing is different; anyone will be able to acquire it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Once it is complete, it could even be used to suppress the onslaught of sin inâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>In other regions?! You think I could take it home with me and use it to save my people?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>No! Nimul, this cannot be allowed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>It is far too powerful! I cannot believe that you would even consider teaching it to an outsider!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Waginau...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>He... Adaleigh has come all this way, just to find a way to save his home. Despite the untold danger in which he is placing himself, he is doing all he can to change this world for the better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>So you see... He and I share the same ideal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Whâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Nimul, please! I need you to teach me this new technique!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Adaleigh, but I can't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Wh-what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Not yet, at least. It is...not yet complete, and may not be for some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>That is why I... No, why this world needs your help, Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Okay. I'll do it. Whatever you need!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Thank you, Adaleigh. I appreciate that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>(An engineer who built his own airship... I can see him being very useful in completing my research.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Before that... I wanna try it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Try out...what exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Spiritbonding! What else? And that new technique of yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>You doubt Sephiron's power? Hmph. How foolish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>I think I'd be more of a fool if I just believed everything I'm told without checking out the facts for myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>You impudent little...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Oh-ho! You wanna go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Hmph. Be careful what you ask for, boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>B-boy?! Who do you think you're calling boy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>I merely call them as I see them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>You...! You take that back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>And why should I? You are behaving like a little boy, and so I name you such.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Will the two of you cut it out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Ngh... I'm really ticked offâ€”but that's just perfect! Hey, Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Yes...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Let's see how this jerk's Spiritbonding and your new technique hold up against my Engineer Soldier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Your...what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>My Engineer Soldier! It's a masterpiece, and my life's work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Interesting... Very well. Let's see what you've got.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>What?! Surely you're not serious, Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Don't forget that you're the one who provoked him, Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>What is taking him so long?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>You heard him. He's going to fight with his Engineer Soldier. I suppose he's still preparing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>This...Engineer Soldier... Have you heard of it before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Of course not. How could I possibly have heard about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Hey! Sorry to keep you waiting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>Wh-what is that? A steel...doll?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>Ah, so this must be your Engineer Soldier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>That's right! It's a real masterpiece!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>It absorbs the magil in the atmosphere and uses it to attune the Soldier to my thoughts, so it can move about on its own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>I...wasn't aware that such a substance existed in the atmosphere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>I suppose the fact that it can power this doll means that it can be converted into energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>Magil... Hmm... This bears further investigation. Thank you, Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>Get your head out of the clouds, Nimul! Do you really intend to fight this...thing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Heh... Pipe down, Waginau. All we need to do is win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Are you so confident of that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>What? Think you can't beat something just because you've never seen it before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>Didn't think someone who stands at the forefront of the Sephira Guard would be such a coward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Hmph. I'll teach this child to respect his betters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>Bring it on! Show me your Spiritbonding and this new technique!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>Go get 'em, Engineer Soldier!</td>
</tr>
