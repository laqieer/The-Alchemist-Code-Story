<td>Haa...haa... That was exhausting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(I wouldn't usually get tired from a mere skirmish like this.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(I couldn't give my commands quickly enough because I didn't have enough confidence—and in myself, at that!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(I can't believe I relied on Won's brute strength to win! How pathetic!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(I have confidence in my wits, but...if my attitude truly led to my being fed false information...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(There is no actual problem with my attitude, of course. However, should others perceive me that way...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Won?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You...idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>O-ouch! That hurt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You're an arrogant brat, and you drive me crazy, but you're amazing when it comes to strategy and tactics!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The monsters in this forest are really strong, you know that? But thanks to your directions, I was able to take them down all by myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Be proud of yourself! Be confident! And go beat up those bastards who gave you false information!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Make them cough up some consolation money!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Baha! You're absurd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wow. I didn't picture you for the snorting laugh type. You're pretty cute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wh—?! I'm not cute! I'm a man! How dare you belittle me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm not belittling you. I'm praising you. You're so cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Q-quiet! If you call me cute one more time, I will—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's the spirit! Don't let anyone tell you who you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>In any case, I don't need to resort to violence. All I need to do is be more careful in the future, and make sure I get more useful information next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That is all too easily achieved, after all, for I am Chao; extraordinary genius and raven-haired wonder child!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Tch, you're really something. You may be overconfident, but it suits you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hey! See that huge tree? It's a landmark—there should be some of those fresh medicinal herbs growing behind it! All right, I'm gonna get my fill!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Wh—?! Now hold on! I will be collecting them first, you hear me?! You can take whatever is left when I am finished!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Heheh, suits me. This is the part you can do for yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hmph. Why should I have to collect them myself? I don't understand why I am always surrounded by those who fail to respect me.</td>
