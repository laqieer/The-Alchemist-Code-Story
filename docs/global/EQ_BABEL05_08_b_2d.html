<td>(I wonder if she came to see me today as well?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(I gave Michael the nasty job of turning her away every time she came.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(I wish I could see her at least one last time, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I can't let her get involved any further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I can't tell anyone about the information written within the book recovered from the ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I can't believe that the Sacred Stone Asmodeus contained such a secret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If I don't protect it, this country will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You're the Court Mage, Lofia, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>A Paladin? Here in the center of the city?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>To accomplish our aim, we can't allow you to remain alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That means your aim is to...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You've uncovered too much. I'm going to silence you. Forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huh?! Oh, blood! Eeek! Someone help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Aargh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ahaha. I doubt I'm surviving this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(I was planning to visit sweet shops across the city today. I guess not being able to do that is my only regret.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(Now that the other side has made such a bold move, the Court Mage Order will be on its guard as well. That means the country will be okay.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The promise we made... That's my other regret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. I'm looking forward to it, too! I'll see you then! I promise—promise!—to come and see you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If you have any problems, just tell me! I'll always take your side, Lofy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It doesn't look like I can keep my promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Milis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Bye-bye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You, there. Paladin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I cannot overlook your actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wh-who the hell do you think you are?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I am Inquisitor Cheryl of the Holy Order of Babel. I am responsible for the judgment of all alchemists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>An i-inquisitor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>First transgression: turning your blade upon a Court Mage of Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Second transgression: use of Alchemy for your own purposes, in direct violation of the Alchemist Code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>These crimes are more than enough to warrant your execution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>W-wait! I never used Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oh, really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Wh-what are you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It is plain to me that you used Alchemy on the townspeople passing by here to deceive their eyes at the moment of the murder, to hide your evil deed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Y-you're wrong! I'm a noble Paladin of the Holy Order of—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Very well, then. Third transgression: breaking the Magna Code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Those of the Holy Guard must comply with the Alchemist Code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I received my mission from the Holy Order! I was merely carrying it out in secrecy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>All of the missions that are currently being circulated among the Paladins are relayed to me via my monocle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>There are no missions recorded that involve murdering a Court Mage in Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Y-you're an inquisitor, aren't you? The Alchemy we use is one and the same! We are both loyal disciples of the Holy Order of Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You must understand! Do you have any idea what will happen to me—and to you—if you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Irrelevant. I deny your appeal on the basis that it is entirely invalid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Our work for the Holy Order directly impacts the advancement of Alchemy! We don't need to ask permission for what we do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>In fact, this is a warning!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I am merely the administrator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I apply the righteous punishments to your hateful sins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Tch! If you won't listen to reason, then you give me no choice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>We may share a use of Alchemy, but what is that to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I loathe Alchemy.</td>
