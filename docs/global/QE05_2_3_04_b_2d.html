<td>Ugh, I feel...sick.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>How slovenly! Then again...I might have had something to do with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Thanks to you, nobody had to die today. We appreciate this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Please, no. It was a happy surprise to be allowed a part in this. Those nobles have gone too far recently, but anybody who speaks against them is taken straight to prison.</td>

<td>Our frustration has been brewing for far too long.</td>

<td>I'm sure he wouldn't admit to being raided while drinking on the job. All this will likely go right under the radar.</td>

<td>I heard that Wadatsumi fell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Some of the highest quality textiles came from Wadatsumi. It's really a terrible waste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Indeed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, send for me if there's anything else I can help you with. I know I'm just some lowly merchant, but I am just as concerned for the future of this country as any of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>War seems to follow me wherever I go. I just wish this mad era would come to an end soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yeah, me too.</td>
