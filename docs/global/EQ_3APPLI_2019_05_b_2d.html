<td>It was like a dream...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>More like a nightmare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I apologize on behalf of my little brother for all of his mischief. He's always been an uppity little jerk, ever since we were kids; charging recklessly into trouble...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're really calling me reckless? That's rich.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Quiet, Romeo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>H-hey, this space-time muck-up wasn't entirely my fault! It was our fault, right, Mira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well...I can't deny my part in all this. You're right. Sorry, everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's partly thanks to you that my plan to fix things worked, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well, duh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh! It's almost time for the Chance Encounter to end! We'll all be sent back to our respective worlds in short order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'll make sure we all make it home safe. You can count on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, guess this is goodbye. Play nice with your brother, Mira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>H-huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>There's no need to blush!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Your face is redder than mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>U-um, Nyx...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yeah? What's up, Hiiragi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>U-um... I'm glad we met.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Me, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>N-Nyx?! Can you still hear me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah! I can hear you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>N-Nyx! Um...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I-I...I want you to know that I really...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We're back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Looks like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I wonder what Hiiragi was trying to say? Oh, well. Guess we'll never know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Snow...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Nyx, it's snowing! Can you believe it?! It never snows out here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Nyx? What're you snickering about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Seeing her get all excited made me feel really happy. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I heard you, Hiiragi. Loud and clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Until very recently, I thought I was a normal girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I like pretty stones, and going on walks... I'm just...me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But then I performed the Blood Covenant, and my entire life changed in an instant. Before I knew it, my normal everyday became...well, a little extraordinary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hiiragi! Let's get going already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>R-right! Sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That stone looks good enough to eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Y-you mustn't eat it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Where'd you get all those rocks, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Eheheh... These stones are the result of my careful analysis and investigation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yet now I'm starting to see that what I at first perceived as extraordinary is becoming my ordinary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That's why I decided to reserve my extraordinary solely for you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Do you know how I feel? Has my heart reached yours?</td>
</tr>
