<td>It's cold, so I started pulling on my overcoat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I rid myself of the vestments of the Court Mage so that I might protect this country...all alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I knew so little of the world, and was enticed by it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Magic interferes with the Alchemia in nature, materializing as the conjurer desires. It is an art which adheres to the guidance of the natural world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>To learn magic is to learn about nature itself. In other words, it teaches one the ways of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I will learn all that there is to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The more I learn, the more distinctly my desires take shape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>They are sweet and profound, just like the tea cakes I so adore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yet, I didn't know that it is only we humans who have to balance our interference and the consequences that follow for things to go well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hey, what are you doing there? Is this a new game? I'm pretty sure you'll freeze to death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, um, no. I'm, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Heheh. I-I guess you can say I sort of collapsed here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Collapsere? Is that some kind of new art? Are you a street performer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Umm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ahahah. I wonder if I'm hallucinating things. Something smells sweet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Are you talking about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's a chiffon cake from the sweets shop across the street.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Cake? Is that food?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't you know what cake is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh? No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's no good. You're missing out on life. Try eating some.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Are you giving it to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Everyone should have the opportunity to enrich their lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Th-thank you? Wow. It's so fluffy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This is so delicious! I've never eaten anything like it before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Our first meeting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Like me, Milis, the girl from the plains, also understood nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Perhaps that's why I felt so much warmth; so much kindness from her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'll come again to this city!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>When I do, let's eat sweets together again, okay? Next time I'll tell you all about my homeland!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh, that's right! You also need to teach me to become a gentlewoman like you, Lofy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>There's so much we've gotta do together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I will never see her again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>She was the last friend I ever made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Those sweet memories of mine... Of the country with so many cakes and confections...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I wanted to hold on to them, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yet, it seems that in the end, I am destined to lose them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm...crying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Am I still...alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Don't come any closer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Is that...Ravina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It is good to see that you are all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Good?! Exactly what part of this is good?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Does she look all right to you?! You... It's your fault that Lofia—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ravina... Please. That's enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I can't believe you, Michael! How could you let someone like her into the manor?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>She very kindly carried Lady Lofia—who is in critical condition—all the way up here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It was the Holy Guard who attacked her in the first place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I am not a member of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You're associated with the Holy Order, aren't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I am an inquisitor of the Holy Order of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It is my duty to judge those who misuse Alchemy, and that includes members of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Well, you didn't stop them, did you?! You haven't done anything at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I offer you my sincerest apologies on behalf of the Holy Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>A Paladin of the Holy Guard attacked a Court Mage and used Alchemy without permission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I cannot overlook this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>As such, I have sent him back under stringent guard, that the Inquisition may take the appropriate measures to deal with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Why was Lofia attacked, then?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>That matter...is currently under investigation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You killed Lofia! It was all you lot! You're all to blame!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Please, at least listen to what I—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Don't come any closer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>R-Ravina, you need to calm down! You mustn't—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Th-this is...magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Lofia was always so kind to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>She's been protecting this country, but you...! You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You want to see uncontrolled power? Then watch! It's meaningless! This kind of power is meaningless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>It's unforgivable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>M-Michael! She's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>The vast stores of magic contained within her are overheating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>O-overheating?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Ravina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>L-Lofia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It's all right, I'm fine, so please... Please calm down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Unnghh... L-Lofia, I'm so sorry! I... I thought... I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Are her powers are out of control?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>After your initial help, Lady Lofia, Ravina and myself have continued the treatment...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Yet Ravina is not yet capable of controlling her powers alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Her emotions, too, are running wild!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>She's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Ravina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I-I'm just c-causing you trouble again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I'm going to make it all stop now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>L-Lofia...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I'm a Court Mage. It is my duty to protect the country. You needn't worry about me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Well, this isn't the first time that this has happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>M-Michael...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Will you lend me a hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>As recompense for killing me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I will not penalize you for that nonsensical statement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>However, none of this is ideal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Alchemy, magic... It's all the same!</td>
</tr>
