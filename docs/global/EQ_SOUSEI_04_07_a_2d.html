<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Look at you... You're half-merged with the forest already... Even after your death, you are protecting us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>O Great Nidhogg, please... I humbly request your mercy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme...! Here in this holy land touched by death, removed from the stagnant world of man..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>The Reincarnation Ritual requires Nidhogg's vast magil to reawaken Sephiron... The resurrection ceremony...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>This originally wasn't meant to be performed on a person's body, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>The person to be reincarnated. An offering of the flesh and blood of the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>All right. Everything is ready now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>"We of Suga receive the guidance of the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>"Please lead us to the blessings of the Tree of Life, Mother of All."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>"Here lies the open gate. Great Sephiron, the pinnacle of compassion, and we her servants, pillars of obedience."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>"The decimum sephirah and the twelve journeys, give the breath of life once more..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This is where my dreams always take me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ugh... The wound on my chest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Wound? Ah, yes... Sinner Julia attacked me. Then...is this the afterlife?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That depends on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Who's that? This mirage has a different sort of presence than the one who usually appears in my dreams...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes, you're correct. This is nothing more than a vision woven by your heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hey, wake up... That's not quite right, is it? If this is a dream like said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're...me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Or perhaps, you are me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You may think of me as your mirror image, born from the fluctuation of your very being after your corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>My heart... You mean to say, that you are my sin. You are the darkness in my heart?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hmm, I wonder? I'm not sure if people can so easily separate what's in their heart into what is dark and what is light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That...makes sense...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But I assume there is some meaning to you being here. Firstly, I'm still alive, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Of course. Why else would everyone be fighting so hard for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Fighting...? That's right, there's still things I must do! I must help Emmel, save everyone in the region...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Why?! That's a ridiculous question. Of course I want to save my family and my village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That is true. If things were normal...but you are not normal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There is a secret resting within you. One that you have not shared with even a single soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>A...secret...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes, a secret. And as long as you hold it locked away, you cannot be reincarnated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>To return, there is a price to be paid. That price is to lay bare all the secrets one has been holding inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But I don't know what that is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Is that really true? Don't you think it's strange?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You want to protect your family and your village. But if that's all you want, what need is there to change the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's because...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You don't have to be afraid. You're the only one here. Have confidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's because I... Because I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I think this world is a horrible place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Living under the constant threat of the Cursed Beasts, the sins of your neighbors, even the fear that destruction may come the next day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No matter where you turn, this world is a cruel place. It feeds on sacrifice and gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Where is the justice? Where is the correct path? No matter how I studied, I could never find the answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>In that case, it must be the world that is wrong. This world has gone mad. At some point, that's what I started to believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I see. Perhaps that is true. If it is... So what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So... Then we must break this world to make it anew. We must defeat the Cursed Beasts to clear the way for tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>So that's why you started to exterminate the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That's right. You're right. This is my own selfishness... But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>But?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>After leaving my village and traveling to many lands, I realized how foolish I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The people I met were all making the best of what they could in life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>They feared the Beasts and loathed sin, but they stood fast and held on to the belief that the next day would come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I shut myself away from everyone, but they were the ones with the strength to face the future; with the conviction to claw and struggle their way through each day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>They did that even though they ought to feel angry at their lot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>It was seeing those people try their best every day that became a kind of light to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I want to affirm those people. I want to support their will to live like that. That is why I'm on this journey... That's why I created Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I can't afford for things to end like this. It can't end like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>This is what I want for all the people who've believed in me. I must change this selfishness of mine into the hope for tomorrow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That's right. For all the people of this world... For all my trusted friends and comrades...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'll put my life on the line for this world. Especially Emmel... My light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ah... So you accept the weight of your own sin, folding it into your dreams of the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's right. So—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>This is...the Godwolf Asena? The avatar of the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>But how? Nidhogg should already be gone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>You're right. The Guardian Dragon is already dead and gone. Those great wings have long fallen to the ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>That said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>There is another priestess. She performed the Reincarnation Ritual using the remains of the Guardian Dragon as a catalyst.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>That means that it and you will become one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>The Godwolf and I will become one...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Yes. This "reincarnation" is the fusion of two lives into one. The creation of a new future...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>This is what the ceremony was originally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Raaaaaaaaarrr!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What's this...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You gave a spectacular answer, Nimul. Striving to become worthy enough to create a new way of the world is a beautiful reason. I wholeheartedly support that choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Go forth and attack, beloved child. Allow me to rest until the end of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Please...wait. You can't be Sephi—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Oh! Nimul! You're awake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Eu...lalia? Where...am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The Reincarnation Ritual drove the corruption out from your body! I'm so glad it worked...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Ah... I guess there's quite a lot to catch you up on. But for now, it's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>You have the time now. The Godwolf crossed over into the ritual...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>That soul was deeply engrained in the Gula Belt and connected to Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>I...see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Oh, and your friends are in the desert now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I know. I heard everything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I heard everything. I heard you speaking of putting your lives on the line...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Sephiron. You granted me your grace, and thanks to that I'm able to stand here now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yes... The Forest of Suga has been revived! The corruption is disappearing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>This is the great Sephiron... The Gula Belt itself, its power connected to the chief of Sephira?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>"Your blessings that reside within me, carried alongside the quadrantal Matters; with these, a new pact is formed with this land!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>"O slumbering spirits of this place! O benevolent protectors of humankind and nature! Hear my voice and answer!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>"Come forth, the new guardian of this region!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Eulalia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Y-yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I'd like to ask for your help again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Yeah! Leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Good. Let's go. Please, Godwolf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Huh? Eeeek?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Urrrrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Of course. They're wound up now. If I were on my own, perhaps I would be a little more worried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Unfortunately, this will be our victory. We have the numbers, and we will crush you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Waginau—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Stay back! Focus on protecting the villagers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>(It's only getting worse and worse... How can we turn this around?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Adaleigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ah... Sorry, Waginau! My hands are full over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Aw, shoot! They figured out that the Engineer Soldier is limited to this area and started focusing their attacks there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Even monsters can be corrupted... I've never heard of such a thing! Look up, they're flying again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I know already! I'm turning Libra around! The defenses on the port side have thinned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>So you've finally exhausted your strength. You were quite a strong opponent, so I will personally dispatch you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Is this...the end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Reinforcements? But you all were on your last legs...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>"I am Transcender of the Gate of Lust!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Wait, that technique is...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Finally, an opening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>"Those without form, come forth from the sea of the void!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Tsk, they shot them down. But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Sorry for keeping you all waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Heh. Looks like you woke up on the wrong side of the bed, same as always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>My apologies. But for now, there's work to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Eulalia, can you get that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>I've got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>"From nothing comes infinity, and from infinity arises infinite light!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Augh!? Urghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Gah-gahhhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Purifying that wide an area all at once...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>That's right... She was said to be a priestess at Emmel's level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>"I am Transcender of the Gate of Gluttony..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>That technique... He's finally back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>It looks like it. I'm relieved that the ritual was completed safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Heeeey, Nimul! We're good over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You were corrupted by Beelzebub and yet now... Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>It seems like you all are much more of a threat than I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>So what now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I kill you. Just as my sin commands me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I see... Then I will brush that sin away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Nonsense!</td>
</tr>
