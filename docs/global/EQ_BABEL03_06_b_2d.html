<td>Huuuzzzzaaaaahhhhhh! Ngh... Argh!</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Carla! Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Neun! We will retreat for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What're you saying?! I can't just do nothing after they made a fool out of me like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>To continue fighting them at this time would be pointless! We have other responsibilities. It's time to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I don't like admitting this, but that woman is simply too powerful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It must be that mark of hers. If we can confirm it, it will mean the completion of our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Tch... I guess we're going back empty-handed for now, but the next time we meet, I'll crush you! You hear me?! Don't you forget it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We've chased them off for now. Carla, are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Balt. I'm...fine. Please...take me to Hawk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hawk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hawk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Thank goodness you're safe, Carla. Are you...hurt? Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Don't worry about me, Hawk! You need to stop talking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Carla. You must...live...no matter what...all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Where are the reinforcements?! Why didn't they come?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Please don't...blame them. It's the same as...growing crops. It takes time for them to sprout...for you to be able...to see them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The seeds have already been planted. The will to protect the desert...is already in everyone's hearts. I'm sure of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Everyone is just...dried up. If they get enough water...I'm sure that one day the people of the desert will be united!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Balt, I'm...counting on you. Protect...Carla. Protect...the desert, and...protect those seeds...until the day...they start to grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>All right. Leave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The stars are so beautiful. This isn't such...a bad way to go. Ah, that's...right... Carla?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Will you...water those...seeds...for me? I know that...someday...they will...grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>H-Hawk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You idiot! You can push me around as much as you want! Just don't...leave me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Gosh darnit... Gosh darnit! Why does it have to...be like...this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I know... I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Master Ryle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Why the surprise? You think I wouldn't notice a guild member running around like that at this time of night?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Forgive me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It seems like there was some kind of fight here. Hmph. So you came, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I...did, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>So this is where you were. Are you...all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Balt... These crops just won't grow. Even though I water them every day and everything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Sounds about right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We have to protect the desert until they've grown, like we promised Hawk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hey, Balt? What do you think about creating a mercenary guildâ€”a band of vigilantes? To protect the desert, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Carla...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I can't afford to be sad forever. That would just be...negligent, you know? I feel like I should, you know...actually start doing something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hawk tried to protect the desert. I want to carry on his will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>That's not a bad idea. I'll help you. I did promise Hawk, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Thanks, Balt. Well, it looks like we're gonna start getting really busy soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Have you thought about a name? For the guild, I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I have! I've been thinking about Hawk's will, and my hope that it will someday be realized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>So...I have decided that the guild will be called the Sand Hawks! Let's protect the desert together, Balt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>That's a good name! All right! I'll help you out with everything I've got!</td>
