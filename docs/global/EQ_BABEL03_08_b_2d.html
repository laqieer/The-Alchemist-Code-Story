<td>Balt! You don't have to push yourself so hard! You're wounded!</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>I'm not sure what's going on, but let me fight!</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>Just stay back! Don't use your powers! Urgh! There're so many of them, but I can't let them take Carla!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It would be wise to just step aside and hand her over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Tch! You have the worst timing ever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Blood. Red. Balt. Rest now.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There's no way I can back down!</td>

<td>Ah, the Corpse...expedient as ever. I'm impressed you found her before I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>All that's left is to see who can get her out of here first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Quit with your jokes! I won't let any of you have her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, you will hand her over. The future of Gluttony Foss depends on it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Your pitiful needs are nothing. We need her for the greater good of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Your country or the world... It is a waste of time to even compare the two. The girl is ours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I do agree with one point. It is a waste of time trying to compare one against the other. We will eradicate those who get in our way. It's as simple as that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So, the fate of the world will change depending on who gets the girl. How entertaining! Let us finish this here and now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That is enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
