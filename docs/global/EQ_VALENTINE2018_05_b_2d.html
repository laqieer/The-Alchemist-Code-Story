<td>Ugh! It's annoying how persistent they are. Anyway, back to the business at hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Rahu... Wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Noah? Is it...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's...completely smashed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>B-but the chocolate's fine! Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm sorry, everyone... There's no way I can fix my mistake by giving her a broken gift like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>All that's left is the smell of the chocolate... The smell of the green cacao of courage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm sure that it will give you the courage you need to repair your relationship with Emma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Just don't forget that it's not just about the chocolate, but also about what you want to convey to the person in question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Emma... Um... I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said what I said. I hope that it's not a dealbreaker and that we can still be friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So, um, I made you this! Chocolate! For someone who has been a good friend to me, who I hope will continue to be my friend for a long time to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Interesting. I didn't think this would ever happen, let alone that you would be the first to extend the olive branch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I also have something to give you. Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wait... Could this be...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I made it with the orange cacao. It was kind of a trial to get the wrapping how I wanted it, but here you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Emma, you also made chocolate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yep! She was already doing it when we found her, so we got to help out a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's kind of funny that the both of them ended up making chocolate for each other. The two of them really care about their friendship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Such good friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh! Noah, look! The chocolate inside is completely fine! It’s not broken at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You're...right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The wrapping you chose is just as stubborn and unyielding as you are. Haha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Excuse me? Well, haven't you gone a little overboard with the decorations on this chocolate that you gave me? How did you even manage to get all of these on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Talent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh... I guess...compared to this, my chocolate must be...pretty boring...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Umgf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>S-slow down! You'll choke if you eat it that fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Noah! What is this?! This chocolate is amazingly delicious! What's in it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>R-really? It's good?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yeah! Here, have some!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Umgf! I mean, it is pretty good, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I actually think yours tastes better. Here, open up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Mmph! Hm... I don't know! I think yours is still better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No, yours is definitely better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Isn't it just that they think the best of each other? This is silly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But isn't it nice that they're friends again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yeah, look at those smiles! Now, if you two are finished, the rest of us still have chocolate to make!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Albea, you'll be making some as well, right? For I-know-who!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I-I'm—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Then let's go back to the home economics room! Come on, Albea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>He-hey, wait! Don't just push me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm surprised you were willing to break the school rules to do something for me, Noah. Heh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, it's not like I'm a student here anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Besides, there's something that is more important to me than rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Uh... Never you mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>No chocolate is more delicious than that eaten with the people you care about most.</td>
