</tr>
<tr>

<td>I got a really bad score on one of my tests recently, and it made me think maybe I'm not cut out to be a witch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>School Girl A</td>
<td>Then...somebody told me there was a peddler in town who sold chocolate that can grant wishes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>("Somebody"?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>School Girl A</td>
<td>I found him, and he recommended this particular chocolate to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>School Girl A</td>
<td>He said that in order to become a proper witch, I needed to be both magnanimous and composed, and that Purple and Blue Cacao could help me with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>School Girl A</td>
<td>But because it was black market chocolate, it had high concentrations of cacao, which meant it'd be especially effective, but also have even worse side effects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>School Girl A</td>
<td>He said I wouldn't be able to become a proper witch without going through at least a little pain and suffering, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>No wonder you didn't want anyone to help you at first. But you must know that Rainbow Cacao is contraband for a reason, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>School Girl A</td>
<td>Yeah. I've been taught how dangerous it is. We all have. But the peddler said that if I could withstand its effects, it'd make me stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>School Girl A</td>
<td>He even told me that all the elite witches knew this and worked to get it banned from public sale so no one could become as strong as they are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>School Girl A</td>
<td>He was so convincing, I... I just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>Fell right into his trap. What an awful man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>I don't really get it, though. Why would you be so desperate to succeed as a witch that you'd be willing to eat something you knew was probably poisonous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>School Girl A</td>
<td>Because there's no point in becoming a witch at all if you're not one of the elite! No one'll ever listen to you otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>She means that a witch is only as powerful and influential as she is successful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Powerful enough to ignore all the citizens' requests for Rainbow Cacao and hold a monopoly over its distribution, for example.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>I understand why you bought the chocolate. But I hate to tell you, eating it will not have any lasting effect on your magnanimity or composure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>School Girl A</td>
<td>What? But...isn't that what Purple and Blue Cacao are supposed to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>It is. But the effects of Rainbow Cacao are temporary. Sure, purple will increase your charm, and blue will make you calm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>But the components of the cacao aren't absorbed into the body, which means its effects won't last beyond when the material is...expunged from the system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>School Girl A</td>
<td>Ugh. So it was all for nothing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>I might embellish my wares a little to gain more interest, but I'd never outright lie about any of them. Especially if it would put my customers in danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>I used to say the thing I hate most is when a merchant doesn't know the first thing about what they're selling and is too lazy to look it up...but dangerous misrepresentation is on a whole other level!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>This seems to have struck a chord with you. You're spot-on, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Yes, Margaret's absolutely right. The very least he should have done is explain the actual risks and the actual effects of the cacao.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Even I provide a thorough description of the side effects when I prescribe potentially dangerous medicine to my patients.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Granted, people don't really seem to want to take it after I do, but it's the thought that counts, right?</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>That is ethically sound, if...nothing else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>I bet it's because of that peddler that so many people in town are getting sick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Still, it's strange...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>What is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>Well, despite all the chaos that chocolate's causing, the peddler is presumably still selling it, or else there wouldn't be so many new cases. It's surprisingly brazen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Oh! That's a good point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>I'm going to patrol the area. If there really is still someone out there hawking chocolate, then there will most likely be other people nearby suffering its effects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>This could be a good chance to gather some intel on his source, too. You two go on ahead without me and try to find this black market the court mages were talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
