<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/shah.png" alt="Shahel" height="128"><br>Shahel</td>
<td>Oh, yes. And she was quite delightful, if I may say so! Though naught but a powerless human, she stood bravely against a Cursed Beast, gained a party of companions, and completely upset the balance of everything.</td>
