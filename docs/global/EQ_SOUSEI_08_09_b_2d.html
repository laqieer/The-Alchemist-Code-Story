<td>001</td>
<td>You've lost, Bianca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Why will you not inflict the finishing blow? I am the priestess of Ouroboros, the very first member of the Infinite Serpent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Because you want me to kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Did you really think I wouldn't notice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You were the one who avoided clashing with Ouroboros before—yet here, you initiated the fight yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That alone raised a number of red flags for me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>And brought to mind several possible reasons for this situation we find ourselves in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I believe the key to the Ceremony of Creation is your very life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The Ceremony will start with your death and proceed through an incalculable litany of sacrifices, ultimately leading to the renewal of the world. Am I correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This entire encounter came across as forced—as staged. It was obvious some unseen scenario was being laid out for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You're rushing to get it finished. You're desperate. Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>See, I told you it wouldn't work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Shahel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You must understand, Bianca. Humans are curious creatures by nature. They live to seek the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Show them a riddle, and they will give their everything to understand it, then build a belief system out of the answer when they do. It is their greatest joy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>He has already resolved himself to his own ideals. Your plan was doomed to failure from the start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What you should have done is ask him if he was prepared to fight against his loved ones. Then you might have gotten somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I hesitate to even play into your little games, but...what are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Precisely what I said. When we first spoke, I believe I told you, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That a mysterious group of people had occupied these lands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>And the one who leads that group is the Vessel of Purification herself...your sister, Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Wh-what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>She even killed me! Such a wretched thing to do, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Killed?! What are you talking about? You're right here, alive and well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh, actually, I'm sort of a colony of beings. We're called high elves, but originally, we were all just...me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>A copied existence?! What are you, exactly? A dragon? Or perhaps something they constructed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>An excellent conjecture. I'm the caretaker of the territories of the sevens sins, and the being who has inherited the dragons' will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>They created life in the image of humans, and the resulting group that came about was all me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The diversity amongst my progeny was just something I added later, for a bit of fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I don't care who or what you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Is Emmel really here? And did she really take over the Infinite Serpent?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh, yes. And she was quite delightful, if I may say so! Though naught but a powerless human, she stood bravely against a Cursed Beast, gained a party of companions, and completely upset the balance of everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>She declared quite passionately that she would take on the role of the sole sacrifice to save this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If you wish to stop her, you'd best hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Right now, she is in the process of synchronizing with the Cursed Beast Lucifer. I imagine the procedure is nearly complete, at this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>So even if you don't go, I'm certain she'll be along to see you soon...if only to stop you.</td>
</tr>
