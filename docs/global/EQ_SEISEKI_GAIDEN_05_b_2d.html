<td>You did well, Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's only because fighting Yauras left you slightly fatigued... That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I don't know... I should have realized that my blade was getting dull.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No, there was barely a difference between us... You could easily have become Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Heh... I guess you could say that I'm better at swinging my sword around on the front lines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So I'm more suited to being your sword of justice than Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm glad to have you by my side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Let's go one more round. This time, I won't lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Bring it on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hey! I've finished repairing Excalibur...! Training again? You guys never tire of that, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I suppose that's it for today. We'll have to settle this at a later time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's too soon to decide the winner now. Let's spar here again later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You're on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I miss those days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's thanks to that time that I am the person I am today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I will spread peace and justice throughout the world, for Cadanova as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That...is my duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's just like you. In that case, don't you think it's time that you listen to your heart?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Kaya, you have your duty...and I have mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh? Have you decided, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'll make my decision once I fully understand how the justice you are seeking is different to the justice of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Where are we going next?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well, since you've started to understand... Let's go our separate ways from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If my suspicions are correct... This will be extremely dangerous. It would be wise for you to leave even before you fully understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But if it's that dangerous, then I should...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This world cannot afford to lose its Lord Commander. You should understand that better than anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That may be true, but I can't just leave. Once I've started something, I can't move on until I've taken responsibility for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Your stubbornness can be a nuisance...but will you accompany me for just a little while longer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes. I'll find a way to take responsibility before this is done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Zain... You... No, it'd be insensitive to say it now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Next, we will head for...Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
