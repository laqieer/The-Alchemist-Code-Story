<td>Where are you going, aye? You're not gonna save Fiona?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The little lady isn't at the Beckrams' mansion. No point in sneaking in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Where is Fiona, aye?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's what we're going to find out. Wait...is it just me or is the air around here exceptionally bad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Aye, this is one of their leading factories. This, right here, is a huge plant that runs on a steam engine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You've got smoke and fire blowing out of that chimney. No wonder everyone's wearing masks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Actually, it's pretty cold. Another side effect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Aye, the pollution surrounding this area is terrible. The black clouds prevent the sunlight from shining through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Jeez. It's pretty serious. By the way, what're those small things I keep seeing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They're diligently move about carrying materials. Are they Alkaroids too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Those are Demons, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Demons? Are you talking about Demons created from ancient Alchemy? Well, well. What adorable little weapons of destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's true, aye! Alvarez found them from somewhere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The Beckrams spread them and they now assist the lives of the people here. Their existence has become a threat to us, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Alvarez? That sounds really shady. Why isn't the Holy Guard doing anything about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Demons can't be activated outside of their country, aye. That's why even we Alkemonos are stronger than them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Guess they're leaving them be as long as they're working inside Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I don't know how, but there's a high possibility the Beckrams are using Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The Demons do dangerous work that humans can't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's why the Demons and Alkaroids have become popular, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But, because of that, there's been a lack of jobs for people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I guess you can call it the price of convenience. How ironic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Anyway, we should focus on finding where Fiona is. Is there a bar around here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You're going to drink during this crisis, aye? Unbelievable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's to gain information. News accumulates in bars. It's been that way since the old days.</td>
