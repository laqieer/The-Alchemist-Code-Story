<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hm? What are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>"Were these presents for yourself? Us animals are sad since Santa doesn't bring us presents. We want presents too!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I see. Hmm, I understand how you feel. But, this is gonna go on our tree...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Aww, I feel bad.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Arf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You listened to us before it came to punishment. You're very good kids, yes you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's right. That deserves a present!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes! I'll do my best to make one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(The animals are also looking forward to Winter Holiday, huh.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(Of course they are, it's Winter Holiday after all!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...I wonder when those two will come back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ravina, what's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh, nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Everyone, the tree is straight ahead! Take care not to get lost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>He said the tree is over there! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ravina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey, are we there yet? We've already walked quite a ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Not yet, it seems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We're going the right way, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I...I think so. Probably. We're going the way Yuki told us to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ah, I almost forgot! They made us walk a long time before, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This is quite a tough path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(...I hope I wasn't being rude. Even though Nina cared enough to worry about me...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(Klima also cared about me, said we should have a fun Winter Holiday...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(...even though everyone has been so kind to me, even though this is different than past times, but for some reason I...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ravina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Eek! Um, w-what are we talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We-we were talking about what present you'd like to get from Santa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I, for one, would like a new ribbon, or something like that! A cute ribbon which Chloe can tie in my hair for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>For me...probably clothes? Something I can wear in water... Or perhaps a nice relaxing pillow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>How about you, Ravina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What do you want, Ravina? As a present from Santa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I want...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...I don't think I'll be getting anything from Santa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Because I'm not a good kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Everyone's working so hard to prepare for this party but I'm sad because I'm thinking about Michael and Lofia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And Klima, and Nina, and Birgitta, Lotia, even though everyone has been so nice to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I still wonder if Michael and Lofia could just finish security earlier. Then the three of us could prepare for this party together. That's all I think about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>This is why I think I'm no good. This is why I won't get a present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ravina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oh! Look! So many huge trees!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wow... Amazing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>And lots of monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>They don't seem to be leaving the trees... What're we gonna do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Sheesh! Hogging things to themselves is no good! I say we teach them a lesson.</td>
