<td>You mean to tell me the assassinations of our nobles are being carried out by a single culprit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noble A</td>
<td>That is correct, my lord. We humbly apologize for disturbing you with such foul news at this critical moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>King of Envylia</td>
<td>Why not let the Blue Flame Guard rid us of the rogue?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noble B</td>
<td>The Blue Flame Guard?! But my lord, if we were to reduce the number of them guarding this castle, we may very well become the assassin's victims!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noble C</td>
<td>Then what do you suggest we do? Are we to simply leave those beyond these walls to die?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noble B</td>
<td>I-I would never...! Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noble A</td>
<td>The mobilization of the Blue Flame Guard would cause much distress among the populace. We need something more...subtle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noble C</td>
<td>Have we the time to devise a plan for such an endeavor? Time is of the essence here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>King of Envylia</td>
<td>With our legal reforms still under way, the absence of the knights may cost us dearly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>King of Envylia</td>
<td>There is no other choice. We will have to employ mercenaries for the defense of nobles beyond our walls. Make a proclamation of this decision at once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nobles</td>
<td>Yes, my lord!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noble A</td>
<td>Gah! Who would dare to do such a thing?! And for what nefarious reasons?!</td>
