<td>You mean to tell me the assassinations of our nobles are being carried out by a single culprit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That is correct, my lord. We humbly apologize for disturbing you with such foul news at this critical moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why not let the Blue Flame Guard rid us of the rogue?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The Blue Flame Guard?! But my lord, if we were to reduce the number of them guarding this castle, we may very well become the assassin's victims!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Then what do you suggest we do? Are we to simply leave those beyond these walls to die?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I-I would never...! Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The mobilization of the Blue Flame Guard would cause much distress among the populace. We need something more...subtle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Have we the time to devise a plan for such an endeavor? Time is of the essence here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>With our legal reforms still under way, the absence of the knights may cost us dearly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There is no other choice. We will have to employ mercenaries for the defense of nobles beyond our walls. Make a proclamation of this decision at once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes, my lord!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Gah! Who would dare to do such a thing?! And for what nefarious reasons?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Some people really just have it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>"It"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Luck! Or whatever you want to call it! I mean, come on. As soon as Vettel becomes our captain, we get a national commission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...You make it sound as though I have no luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Still, it doesn't mean we have accepted him as our captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Tsk, tsk. This kind of resistance to positive change is why we're seen as soldiers that can barely do more than hack and slash.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Natalie, what are you trying to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm just saying that accomplishing this mission is a big chance to get the Scarlet Legion's name out there and show the world what we can do! That is, if the assassin really exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, it is a fact that the people in the upper crust of society in Envylia are getting assassinated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>One would think the Blue Flame Guard would be the ones doing something about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>How pitiful. I understand they're still working out the kinks of governance, but it's shameful that they're failing to defend the lives of their own countrymen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's a little unfair. I'm sure they're just following orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>They're probably stuck on guard duty at the castle, since the country declared independence only recently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>In any case... I suppose we should just be thankful we have this opportunity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey, you. What business might you have here at this hour?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, well, you see...we were employed to do some patrols around here. Apparently, several crimes were reported in the area recently... And you are...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I see. I serve as a footman in this mansion. I am just now returning from running errands for my lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You've heard of the recent incidents, have you not? Be cautious when walking out at night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>My, my. Such kind young men! Thank you for your regards. Now, I must be off. Good luck with your patrols.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Everything seems to be fine here. Should we take a look around back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Go ahead. Vettel, I leave the rest of this to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Gerald? Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I just need to check something. I'll be right back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What? Wait, Gerald! Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's fine. He's not the kind of person who just does things on a whim. We can leave whatever it is to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Really? Hmph. You'd think that as a former captain, he would know a thing or two about teamwork.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We still consider him our captain, y'know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Shut it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Whew... It's been a long day. Time for bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Not even a fragment of wariness. Pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wh-who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ugh! Boring! So very boring!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>How am I supposed to enjoy this?! What's wrong with you?! Did they forget to hook up the fight-or-flight instinct when they were building you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Y-you transformed?! Wh-what are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Me? I'm an assassin. The last man you will ever meet. Heh! What do you think? Good catchphrase, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm honestly a little disappointed that you're the only one here to appreciate it, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>An assassin?! You mean, the one that has beenâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Gah! Literally every other one of my targets said the same thing! It's just like, show a little creativity! Is that too much to ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>S-somebody, help!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Oh, wow. Not even your last words are original. C'mon, try another one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Give me a "Come at me, bro!" or a "Smite me, oh mighty smiter!" Hmph. The lack of respect in this industry is really appalling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Eeeeek!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oof. Nothing, huh? Well, I'm done here. It was barely worth crawling out of bed for this mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Just...die already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Eeeek!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You've got quite a mouth on you. Assassin may not be the best job for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>P-please, help me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>No need to ask. That is my mission, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I am Gerald, Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Legion; a mercenary under the employ of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>A mercenary? Heh... Hehehe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Heh heh... Hahaha! Yes! Yes, finally!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Oh man, oh man, oh man! This is exactly the kind of thing I've been waiting for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You're perfect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You're...a strange one. What's your deal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That's my line! What gave me away?! Was my wig crooked?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>What's strangest to me is that more people didn't notice. There isn't an old man in the world who can walk so silently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>My footsteps?! Ugh, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>The biggest issue, however...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>No matter how perfect the disguise, there's no way someone emanating so much bloodlust could fail to draw attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Bloodlust! Oh, you are good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>This is so, so, so, so sweet! You are freaking great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>This is the excitement I've been looking for! Yahooo!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>H-here he comes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Oh, yes! This! This is what I'm in it for! There's no thrill in killing the pathetic, gormless targets! It's only in outdoing their capable guards!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Having the chance to witness such staunch, strong defenders such as yourself lose their cool when I flawlessly fulfill my mission objectives... This is the dream!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Thank you, you witless noble! As a reward for your participation, I will gladly win this game with your death!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You definitely speak too much. You! Get out of here. You'll just get in my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Th-thank you! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>What the...? Hey, wait a minute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You're not going anywhere. You're not the only one here on a mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Haha! A battle between two hired hands! Seriously the best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Why am I not surprised that you are committed to monologuing even right before a fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>"Before" a fight? Sorry, but it's already over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>...Nngh?!  Wh-when did you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Oops! Did you forget? I'm an assassin! Duh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>My name is Ren, and I...am the last man you will ever meet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Ugh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Oh man. Thanks to you, this turned out to be an exhilarating night! After all that, I feel a little sorry to say this, but...I do have to go after that noble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>A mission is a mission after all. Gotta finish what I came for. Bye, Vice-Something of the Whatever Legion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Huh...? Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Urgh... I am Gerald, Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Legion! You better not forget it again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Ouch... Well! Throwing people across the room now, are we? Didn't your mama teach you any manners? Heh...hehehe... You seriously don't disappoint!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Argh! I am going to shut that trap of yours! ...Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>N-not now! Come on, legs! Move!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Aw, is this the end? I don't want it to end yet! I guess it's a sign of growing up to recognize that all fun times come to an end. Sorry Vice-Captain, but this is your time to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Ngh! This can't be how it ends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I don't think I've ever seen you backed into a corner like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Sorry, was I late?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Yeah...as usual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Uh-oh! Backup! Am I the one at a disadvantage now? That just adds to the excitement!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>"Excitement"...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>He talks a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I wish I could spend a little more time getting to know you since you just got here, but I have a mission to accomplish. Sorry, but I have to end this now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Vettel, watch out! He's fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>...! No way! You can see my moves?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Well, you're far from the first opponent I've faced who was quick on their feet. There were plenty of people like that when I was in the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Wow, really?! You're a Paladin?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Ex-Paladin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Oh, this just keeps getting better! Can a Paladin handle this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Wow! You really can keep up with me! You're fantastic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Vettel is the Scarlet Legion's Captain. You shouldn't underestimate him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>About that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>He got you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>He really is fast, isn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Oh man, seriously? Really? Wow! Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I've never been praised by a member of the Holy Guard before! My bad!  Former Holy Guard member.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Don't let your guard down, Vettel! This one can hit you with an attack out of nowhere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Gerald! Vettel! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Natalie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Oh? My, my. Is Lady Luck smiling down upon me? Is that a weakness I can take advantage of coming this way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Natalie! Run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>I'm so sorry, but this the way to get to those tough guys. Don't hate me, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Noooooo!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Vettel?! Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Alright! This turned out even better than I expected!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Protecting your friend by giving up your arm? You guys keep getting cooler and cooler!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Vettel... Bear with it just a little longer. This should be over in a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>A sneak attack from behind? You shouldn't annouâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>...?! What the...? Hey, let go! I said let go!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>You can't dodge from this close. This is the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Wh-wha...?! Whaaaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Gerald! Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Let me ask you one thing. What do you fight for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>What? You mean, who's my client? That's the one thing I won't talk about. You might not think much of us, but we assassins do have something of a code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>No, I mean...why did you choose a life of constant danger? Why do you wield a blade?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Why? For...money? Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Don't move! I will cut you down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>I am really not loving this situation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Money. You take lives for something like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Oh, please. If you're gonna lecture me, just don't. If I were to write on paper all the sermons thrown at me, it'd stack taller than the Tower of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>This is just the way the world is, okay? Kill or be killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>You little...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Gerald, hold on! I'm sorry. I don't mean to lecture you. I just want to know if this really makes you happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Happy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Y-yeah... Sorry, this seriously hurts. Do you mind if I get this sword out of my arm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>I mean...sure. I'm not really in a position to say that you can't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Dead right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>I said stop it. Ow! Huh... This is a good sword. Well maintained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Uh, thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>You're very good with it. Don't you think your talents are wasted on something as frivolous as money?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>No matter what it costs you to swing this blade, you will only ever get those little pieces of paper. Instead...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>What if a single swing of that blade could make hundreds, thousands, maybe even millions of people smile? Maybe it's just me, but it sounds a little more interesting than what you're doing now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Millions? ...Smile?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Well, we just started. So maybe a few dozen at best for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>But I truly believe that we can become an order of knights with that kind of influence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Think about it. Taking lives, living hidden in the shadows...or saving lives, surrounded by happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>I think the latter would be much more fun. Don't you think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>What's the point of all your chatter? What are you getting at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Chatter? No, this is an invitation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Hey. Hey, wait a minute...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>The Scarlet Legion could use his help. My instincts tell me we could achieve more than we could have ever dreamed if he was with us... It's just...a feeling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>What do you think? Any objections?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>I do! I object! He almost killed me!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Yet he didn't. He attempted to, and he failed. We'll get him to apologize properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>What...? An apology?! Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Yeah, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Haha... Hahahahahaha!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>What's so funny? I'm dead serious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Sorry, man! Really...but, seriously, did you forget? I'm an assassin. Do you need to hear it again? Assassin! Assassin. Assassin, assassin, assassin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>I could do this all day. Honestly, how can one troop of mercenaries have this much character?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>...! Does that mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Nah. Don't get ahead of yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>The sword! Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Don't worry. There's no reason for me to fight you guys anymore. I mean, that stupid noble got away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Wait, does this mean I was bested by that idiot?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>I know you were hired for this mission, but if possible, I'd appreciate it if you'd let him go. I'd rather not fight you anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>That's the first time someone's tried asking me something like that straight to my face. You really are interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Wait! Can I get your answer to my invitation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Well, I'll have to report that I failed the mission first, and then...who knows?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>I failed tonight, but it was still the best night ever! Thanks, weirdos!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>Who are you calling weirdos?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>Vettel! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Y-yeah, I just lost a little too much blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Aw, look at that. We've got a pretty ridiculous captain, don't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Is "ridiculous" your nice way of saying "stupid"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>I can hear you, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>Did... Did you guys call him your captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Well...yeah. Maybe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>I mean... He was willing to give up an arm to protect Natalie. Who can object to a captain like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Come on. Get up, you stupid Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>Natalie, you can fix up this idiot's wounds, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>I can hear you, you know!</td>
