<td>I don't like this heavy feeling hanging in the air...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I understand your frustration. But all we can do right now is wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We've waited enough. We should go see for ourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There is a limit to how long this "wait and see" approach can last, but we shouldn't be reckless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Something on your mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm still trying to figure out why the demons attacked us earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It didn't seem like they were trying to wipe us out. But they must have had some purpose. It couldn't simply have been random. What's more...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What's more?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We have to consider the possibility that Celis has ties with Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Isn't that being too presumptuous? Celis would never hide such a thing from us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wouldn't she? She hid that she knew of the Treasure Blade Sumeragi resting within Castle Aquila Rubrum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>And not a one of us truly knows her origins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, I suppose that much is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Now, wait just a minute, here! Are you really going to cast doubt on Celis over a couple random details she chose to keep private?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Aren't you? How well do you truly know her? After all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>She isn't originally from Wadatsumi, is she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Eating connects people. Even those you left behind back home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>They're seated at a table with someone they love. Just thinking that brings peace to my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I do know one thing. She told me before that she left people behind back in her homeland. People who are very dear to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm sure she did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>She's the only one, you know. The only member of the Blade Fox, ever, who was not born in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Are you seriously suggesting she's from Greed Dike? Do you have any proof of that at all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm just considering the possibility. One should always be prepared for the worst-case scenario.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Up till now, our situation has been dire. We cannot afford to take unnecessary risks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Pff... Hahahahahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What's so funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's just a rare sight to see you so worried, Captain Ugachi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>"Worst-case scenario," huh? You're hoping you're wrong, aren't you? That's so sweet of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Are you trying to belittle me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No, no! Certainly not. I'm trying to say that you can put your mind at ease on this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Even if it turns out Celis is from Greed Dike, there's absolutely no doubt she's still on our side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>How can you be so sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Simple. If we were enemies, you think she'd have made those delicious meatballs for us? Come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's just as Captain Tanosuke says. Celis is our close friend and ally. Pointing fingers at her makes no sense at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>After all our battles together, you must realize that too, Captain Ugachi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I know, I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You're just a little anxious, right? That's your cute side showing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Silence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But that's what I like about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I said, silence! How many times must I remind you how much I despise you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Something's up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Who put you in charge?! Don't get ahead of yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You too, Captain Ugachi. Let's go. There's not a moment to lose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Seriously, these two... Come back to us, Celis! We're waiting.</td>
</tr>
