<td>Well, that's the last of them.</td>

<td>These wolves are far larger and more aggressive than any forest beast...</td>

<td>Hey there stranger! Are you lost or do you have some business around these woods?</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Good day! I'm Siegfried.</td>

<td>I was investigating reports of wildlife in the area getting more aggressive and attacking trade caravans.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>While I'm here, I was also hoping to visit a supposed "Village of the Divine". Any idea where that is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Aye. We hail from Sakris Village, that which you call the "Village of the Divine".</td>

<tr>

<td>The wildlife here has always been more spirited, but their pelts are of excellent quality. They've been a boon to our trade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Still, you're right. They've grown bolder lately, and we're doing all we can to keep things safe around these parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I see, would you be willing to guide me back to your village for a visit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Grrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This place ain't safe. Help us out here and we'll gladly welcome a new friend to our village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Certainly!</td>
