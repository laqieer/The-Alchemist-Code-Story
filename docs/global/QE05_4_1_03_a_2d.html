<td>Agatha, what are you doing? Aren't you with Logi today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, hello, Miss Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You can just call me Tina. So what are you doing here? There's nothing but the barracks up ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well, Sir—I-I mean, Logi is out guarding the caravans. I was just wondering what I might be able to do to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh. Me, too.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>R-really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah, but I was called by Adelbert to—</td>

<td>The hell did you just say?!</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Eek!</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Did that come from the barracks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Say that to my face again! See what happens!</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You think I'm afraid of you?! Hah! I said that scoundrels like you are to blame for the downfall of discipline!</td>

<td>014</td>
<td>Getting drunk this early in the day... Have you no shame?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Shove it! What's wrong with me drinking what I bought with my own money when I want?!</td>

<td>016</td>
<td>A fight! Why would...?</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We may have fought them off once, but the Gluttony army will be coming back.</td>

<td>Keep out of this, woman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This is between us! Please, just mind your own business!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Calm down, boys. Arguing amongst each other isn't going to solve anything. We're comrades fighting against a common enemy.</td>

<td>Stop this nonsense, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Comrades?! You dare call this wretch my equal?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>A wretch?! I'm a professional mercenary! You're not even from the Desert Zone, and you think you can tell me what to do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, I tried to be nice about it, but I guess I'm going to have to be a little rough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh? C-can't we talk this through?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I've never been good with words. This is just easier.</td>

<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You think you can take me down?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I have my pride as a soldier! I will defend my honor at all costs!</td>
