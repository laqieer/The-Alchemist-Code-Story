<td>Gwahhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You got him, Ravina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ravina, why?! Why did you attack Santa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Calm down Klima. Look closely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey, this isn't a jolly old man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hm? Wh-who is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>A fake Santa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>A fake Santa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I see. You're the thief masquerading as Santa, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...now that you mention it, that soldier earlier told us something about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You pretend to be Santa Claus bringing presents and then you steal all you can...you miscreant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I see now... I'm sorry Ravina, for yelling at you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No, it's fine. I'm sorry too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We heard you caught a thief! Great work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Thanks to you we can all enjoy a wonderful Winter Holiday. Here, for your troubles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Eh? Is this...cake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This is our most popular cake. Please share and enjoy it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I...I can have it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Someone cancelled their order, so we decided to give it you for being so good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>B-but, I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Go ahead! It's yours! You saved Winter Holiday for everyone. You're a great kid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's right! On top of your own job, you also helped Michael and Lofia out with their job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes yes! A very good kid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There are only good, hardworking kids here. That's why the real Santa is sure to bring you a wonderful present!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>A present...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Santa always puts his presents in stockings. Birgitta taught me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So, you should put the biggest stocking you have close to your pillow. The thing you want most, Ravina, Santa is sure to put it there for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Tomorrow morning, let's show each other our presents! Promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I can't wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(My heart...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(Seeing those two smile...warms my heart)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh dear children of the world...is there no greater happiness for this old man than to see your smiling faces?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(...I see now. Michael and Lofia were protecting the smiles we see on Winter Holiday)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ravina, what's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...oh, nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well, we should probably get going. The Maruda tribe will be delivering our tree soon and all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That's right, the tree! Nina, Ravina, let's go see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Dear me, I didn't expect an evening like this one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Lofia! Is work over?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>All the good kids went home. So, I'd say our work is pretty much done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Even so, working security for Winter Holiday, it was harder than I thought it would be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Thieves over there, fights over here, Michael and I were running all over the place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I was so busy that I asked you to pass on a message for me, Lotiyah... I'm sorry it turned out to be so much trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No problem! It was fun, actually!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It was good that I asked you all for that favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I thought that you, having treated people and beasts alike in the arena fairly, would be the right person for the job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Awww you're making me blush!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hey! But, if you felt that way, wouldn't it have been better to just let Ravina do security with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>She so badly wanted to work with you two tonight, but you wouldn't let her... She was really bummed out about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Well, Ravina still doesn't know about that secret, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>In the unlikely event that she witnessed a real Santa chase, she might do something crazy and rash.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ahh, that's true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Really, thank you so much. As thanks, I'll take you to my favorite pancake place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Wow! Yes! Looking forward to it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>So, when you're done with your work, make sure to come to the party as soon as possible! Everyone will be waiting for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It was also a great opportunity. I wanted Ravina to become closer friends with everyone, besides Michael and I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Since becoming a phantom soldier, we've been able to meets lots of different people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's exactly right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Michael! Are you done with Santa's work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Normally, I wouldn't leave early, but... I heard that good little children were waiting for me to return home, so I left early.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Since I myself am a good kid, I feel I got a present too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Ho ho ho, why, I'm talking about a Winter Holiday miracle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Well, shall we go? We can't have good kids waiting too long for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Yipee!!! Look! Right in the middle of the room! The tree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Yes! What an amazing tree! It really is the biggest one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Well, it's still a regular tree for now. We need to decorate it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Don't worry, we'll finish decorating it in time for the party. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Yes, let's. We can decorate it with lots of Nina's dolls...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Let's make the tree so wonderful Michael and Lofia will be blown away when they see it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Let's get to work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>(The presents are coming...to all the good kids waiting, including you, Ravina)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>May you have a warm, joyful Winter Holiday!</td>
