<td>Huff...ahh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...Hey, can't you walk a little faster?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry for being...a burden...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well...we've walked quite a bit. How about we take a short break?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There's a some good shade by that rock there. We'll be able to escape the heat for a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Dad, can we afford to waste time here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Miuna, you're a little too hasty. You should remember this: haste makes waste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Sigh... And you're too laidback, dad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(Watching the sands of the hourglass fall...sets my mind at ease...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hey, what are you doing staring at that hourglass?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...?! Oh, um...when I watch the hourglass, it makes me relax.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmm... Show me that for a second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huh?! Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well...I guess the design is passable. More importantly, the sand inside...there's something strange about it. Is this special sand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Pl-please give it back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Whoa...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I-I don't know anything about the sand inside! This is something very important...that my mother gave to me when I was a child!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hey, you don't have to get so frantic. I'm not gonna steal it or anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Mm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Sigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>U-um... May I ask you something? What are you going to do with the Sephirium that you acquire?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We're going to make a weapon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Weapons...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah! I know he may not look the part, but my dad's an incredible blacksmith! I mean, he crafted that Lord...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Miuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...Oops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Also, that thing about me not looking the part is really unnecessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Anyway! Well...due to certain circumstances, my super talented blacksmith of a dad has decided to craft a weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>In order to craft it, we need the Sephirium!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>A weapon...to kill people with?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>My dad makes weapons that give people an advantage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oh, um...s-sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...Well then, let's go...oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What's that sound? Is it quicksand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...! Oh, be careful! It's a monster's nest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ku Yogi, give me your hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh no...it's too late!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Dad! I'm gonna help you now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Huh...?! Miuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(She jumped in without a moment's hesitation...?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>All right...here we go! Dad, are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Phew. That was a close one...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...Oh! Here comes the monster! Run...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Kyaaaaakkkk!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It's a little too late to run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Don't worry. It'll be a piece of cake to handle this thing!</td>
