<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>What did you just say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I asked you why you chose to lead Gluttony Foss' forces...when they were the ones who destroyed your clan, the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>How...do you know...that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I've done my research. At this rate, the people of Saga will meet the same fate as the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Are you saying that they, too, will be swallowed up by Beelzebub one day?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmph. My reasons are simple. Such a course best allows me to fulfill my clan's duty and obligation to Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That alone eclipses the disgrace of wielding my blade for the country that slaughtered my people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Admirable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You wish for me to invade Saga? Have you gone mad, Earth Sprite?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It seems our interests are aligned. Wouldn't it be more profitable for us to work alongside one another?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Now that we've lost the Wind Matter, we don't have much time left to come up with a counterstrategy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Moreover, I'd like to see what it would be like to call Georgios the Flame-Armed General my ally rather than my enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You do realize that my mission is to reclaim Beelzebub, do you not? Don't you care that the stone might fall into the hands of Gluttony Foss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That was the way of it in the past, after all. I was only ever to watch over it for a short time. My goal, from the very beginning, has been to restore the Wind Matter to its original state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I will ask you once more. Why don't we form an alliance to further both of our causes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If it will lead me one step closer to my ultimate goal, then I don't see why not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The pact is sealed. If one of us were to die, then it remains the other's responsibility to honor their mission. What do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Honor the other's mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If we do nothing about Beelzebub, Saga will be destroyed, but the same is true if the Wind Matter remains dormant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>When the dragon awakens, as the legend states, would Gluttony Foss not face the same calamity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Such a catastrophe would mean that neither of our missions can be fulfilled. Such a fate must be avoided!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh, so you too, are a man of conviction, hmm? Very well. However...I have no intention of ever being killed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Neither do I. I am grateful for this arrangement, though...partner. I expect it shall only prove to benefit both of our end goals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Where is the Dragonslayer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Georgios... I swear to honor my promise to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Glurrrppp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There's just no end to them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I feel a vibration in the earth. Swallowing Beelzebub must have given it this power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The dragon has turned Beelzebub into its tool. The Jam are a manifestation of this. Normally, creating such abominations would be impossible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But if using the power of earth to do so, then it wouldn't be beyond the realm of possibility. Earth has the power to nurture life, you see... A revolting thought. I will be the first to take this beast on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We have to destroy its earth core. I will make my way inside from its chest area. No complaints? Voda? Fuu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No, I leave it to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's about time we begin our counterattack!</td>
</tr>
