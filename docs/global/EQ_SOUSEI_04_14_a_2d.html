<td>The quickening of the Cursed Beast echoes even in here.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The fight between my king and the Pursuers has begun...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I forcibly tried to ruin your brother with corruption, so how...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...how can you sleep with such a peaceful expression...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Left flank! What's your status?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>They're putting on the pressure! They've started to split and multiply right on the battlefield!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Is this what made Nimul nervous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>As long as we are in the sanctuary of the Beast, the numbers of the Sinners will keep increasing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But we cannot give in! Nimul and the others are still fighting, too! So there's hope we can see this battle through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Grrrooooooggghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ahhh! Doesn't it seem like its movements are getting more and more aggressive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Why d'ya have to go and lock on to me like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It seems like its gotten more lively since Beelzebub appeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But there's an upside to this. Now, we can spend our time just dodging attacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You say that, but don't forget that I can sense you readying that ultra-super attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well, it's not like I enjoy letting it put us on the defensive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Once the tides turn, I want to be ready to put it down in one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There ya go, Nyx! Sneaky as always!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Would you stop saying things that make me look bad? Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Aw, feeling lonely now that we're not trying as seriously anymore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Guess we've gotta do it this way... So let's kick it up just a notch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Double shoot! Can't believe I really needed repairs in the middle of a battlefield like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Okay, now I'll be able to start fighting again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Man, things look to just keep getting worse and worse. I've got to increase the Engineer Soldier's capacity next time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh, this is bad, this is bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>C'mon, Nimul, you've gotta pull through! Before my last trump card falls, at least...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You merged with the Cursed Beast?! To do something like that, your very self would...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Don't underestimate me, human. I am descended from Dragons, who were the originators of magil in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Even your ability to give form to spirits is within my capabilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What... This technique... Spiritbonding?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>No. This is a particular technique created by the Dragons that manipulates the way of the world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What you call Spiritbonding is no more than a crude imitation of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Give up, humans. You just happen to have been unlucky enough to be born into this world as you are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You have no right to say something like—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Nimul! If this continues, we'll have no cards left to play in this battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I know. But it's not over. We still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's no use. Even the best of your human abilities are far behind what we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That might be true... But that only means we have to be a little more clever about how we attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>So you've come to destroy the Cursed Beast part of me. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Are you okay, Eulalia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Y-yeah, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I've never even considered the possibility of a Cursed Beast that could simply brush off purification...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I don't think it's that we can't purify Beelzebub itself, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The part that is Zafeiris is repelling our Spiritbonding...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Is there no way we can break through?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>From the outside, it's impossible. The whole body is defended by Zafeiris's ability; I can't use my purification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Its shell is made up of the voices of sin. If we used the powers of purification from within it, maybe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>We need someone to be devoured?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>But in that case, they will be affected by the corruption...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>So we need someone to get inside Beelzebub's body who can avoid the corruption and use their powers of purification?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What a lucky turn of events.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>No, there might be another way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If he can neutralize Spiritbonding, maybe Alchemy will do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I see you prefer to live in the comfort of denial, Pursuers of Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Even if you have inherited the protection of Nidhogg, I am still in a category all my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Do you really believe that piddling amount of magil can stand against one such as I now that I have become a Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>We'll never know unless we try!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>"I am Transcender of the Gate of Gluttony!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>He immediately healed himself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Do you understand now? The level of magil I have dwarfs yours a thousand times over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>No matter how much destruction you try to inflict upon me, you'll never reach my core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>And...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Grrrooooooggghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Eeek?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Gughh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Now... I think it's time for me to end this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Argh! This isn't over... We won't give in yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Huh? Whose voice is that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>—maybe Alchemy will do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Nimul? That's right... They're fighting now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>...To save this girl. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Now... I think it's time for me to end this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>All that research and effort, but in the end, they're just people... It was all useless. They won't be able to end it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Of course. To attempt to defy the way of the world itself is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Argh! This isn't over...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>There's no way that I'll ever give up! I will never!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>He just never gives up, does he? But without that determination, he could never have gotten this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>It was impossible from the start for an empty imposter like me to overcome an opponent with so much raw passion...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>But now it's all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Because I have yet another reason I cannot let myself be stopped here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Oh, so you still stand, human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Of...course...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Because I have yet another reason I cannot let myself be stopped here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>With my own hands, I took the life of a friend in this Gula Belt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>She was stern and proper, always finding something to scold me about, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>She was good to my sister; her closest friend. She was happy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Yet somehow, I never noticed her true feelings. In my ignorance, I gave her so much suffering...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Still, when she said that she'd never be able to forget my face...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>The face of this man whose only redeeming qualities were his adherence to his ideals and his research... Whose tunnel-vision caused him to be unable to understand himself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>She told me...that she loved me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>She knew what kind of person I am, but she still loved me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>So I have no choice but to stand my ground here. I have no choice but to continue to stick to my ideals like the fool that I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I will stand strong, like the man she fell in love with. To never change from the man she loved...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I will stand and I will fight, even if my opponent is you, the very sin of Gluttony!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I will consume all that Gluttony myself to save this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I call upon you, Godwolf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Grrrooooooggghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>You are a fool to think that you can bridge the gap in our power with your trite idealism!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>So I'll be a fool! Huzzaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Is he that stupid?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I...suppose he is. Yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>That's why she... That's why we loved him. Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>This body of mine is only a hollow phantasm. The pale dream of a ghost... So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>(...Even breathing hurts... Of course it does. What else did I expect by using Spiritbonding with a body corrupted by sin?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>But...it's a good pain. The pain means I've decided to live having embraced my feelings... Even if they're her feelings...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Farewell, Emmel. Farewell, Nimul. In the end, I wasn't truly a friend to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>But...at least this dream hasn't ended up being such a nightmare...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>What! What is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Preposterous! The sacrificial daughter should have no more power to purify me, but this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>This light... Could it be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>What are you doing?! You're not the kind of man who will let a little difficulty stop you, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I don't think so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Julia, is that you? You're still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>You're going to save the world, right? This is the best chance you're going to get!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>She's right! Eulalia, use Sagittarius!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I'm on it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Gear of judgment, Sagittarius! Under the guidance of Sephiron, please grant me this chance to overcome our sin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>"I embrace the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Grrraaaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Got him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>The Anti-Curse magic neutralized Beelzebub's core! Now we can beat him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Graaah! Don't mock me, humans!</td>
</tr>
