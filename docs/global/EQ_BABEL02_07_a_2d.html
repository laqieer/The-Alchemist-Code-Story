<td>002</td>
<td>All right. Quiet, students! I have an announcement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Heide, your classmate, has officially joined the Holy Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What?! When did that happen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>He didn't even say goodbye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm...going to miss him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We're all going to miss him, but we ought to be happy for him. It's a real honor to be part of the Holy Order, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I hope you all follow in his footsteps and become someone who will contribute to the prosperity of the Holy Order and Babel as a whole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Time for class!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Awwwww!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Woody, he wasn't there today either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heide lost his parents in the war, just like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Woody are you trying to cheer me up? You're so sweet. Hehehe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But I'm totally okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Cause I've got you and Mr. Bunny! I don't feel lonely at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tehe! What should we play today? House? Or should we read a story? Playing Detective's fun, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Everyone's on their way home, so how about we play Detective!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Normally the hallways and classrooms are bustling with sound during the day, but now they're so quiet I could hear a pin drop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What's weirder, though, is that I feel more at home now than I do during the day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I don't feel as lonely... I bet it's because I have you guys for company!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Did you hear that? Maybe someone's still around. I think it came from here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh? Was this door always here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I wonder if I'm allowed to open it... Mmm... Hmm... I'm gonna open it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'll be safe since I've got you guys with me, right? All right, I'm going to open it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Gaaah! Dang it! Why can't I beat you, Corvus?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huff... He really is freakishly strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What do you expect? He was the vice-captain of the Knights of Wratharis, but who would've thought that even the three of us couldn't take him down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ngh... Hmm. I'd better stick to caramel jaegar. It's the only booze for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>He's drinking, too! All right! I'm giving it another shot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Good luck! I'm going to take a breather.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hm? What's wrong, Spica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's been so long since I've seen Lord Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Long...? I know you didn't see him yesterday, and he was in the war council the day before, but didn't you say hello this morning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's different... When he was in the Knights of Wratharis, I was always by his side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You didn't complain at all when we were living in the forest, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That was different, too. Now we're here in the same place...but we never get to meet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I desperately want to see him...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Your love for him is so awe-inspiring!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Lord Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What about me, Spica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>L-Lord Zahar!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>How fares your training with Corvus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I-it's going well! I'll become stronger so I can be of more assistance to you, Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I have no doubt that you will. Continue striving to do your utmost. That's right... Letitia, give them one each.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Certainly. One for Spica...and one for Silma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Is this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It's Shadow Messiah's insignia. Ila, go get yours from Corvus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>L-Lord Zahar! I will do my utmost to live up to this insignia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Is something wrong? Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Oh... N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Off you go, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I never know what Letitia is thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What is her relationship with Lord Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Silma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Oh! Sorry, Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'm going back to train with Corvus. I have to get stronger, no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Spica, w-wait up! I'm coming, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Tsk, tsk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Nothing new. Spica really doesn't like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Don't you go telling her off, now. It's good for her. She needs this fire in her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Her fire may seem to burn dim and weak like fading embers...but it's stronger than you might think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I must say, I never expected you to actually make an insignia of your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The article in itself is meaningless, but given form, it can become a medium to convey one's will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Just like the wooden necklace I gave you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Exactly. Spica is weak and fragile. She...will break once she reaches her capacity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yet before that happens...you mean to let her go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>It's almost like giving away a porcelain vase you couldn't bear to break. How sweet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I would rather have her become a vessel to inherit my ambitions and my will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Let's hope that never becomes necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>The same applies to Corvus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>We are laying the foundations for them, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Indeed. They are the ideal group to whom we can leave our new world order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>As you will it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Report for Lord Zahar! We have discovered the hiding place of the researcher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Continue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>He is staying at the Wratharis Institute of Sorcery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Heh heh... Well done. Letitia, summon everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>As you command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>How far does this stairway go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Woody, it's going to be okay...probably.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I see a light...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>If I could have some more time! I'm so close! I guarantee you'll be satisfied with the finished product—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You make the same excuse time and time again! How long do you expect me to wait?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>(I can hear people talking.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I swear, I just need more time! If you'd just look at the results of my resear—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>We've been through this before. You stall by showing me your worthless results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I beg to differ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>(That's the alchemy professor...but who's he with?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>(Research? Results? What could they be talking about?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Truthfully speaking, I need more test subjects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>You have enough for this experiment, don't you? Hmm... More test subjects, huh? We are running out of students.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I will not forgive any further delays.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Y-yes! Our experiment on alchemical resistance was a success! Please, have a look at the results!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Uh... Urgk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Th-that's Heide!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Um... It's me, Professor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Oh, well if it isn't...Mia...from the Phantom Arts class. What are you doing in a place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I-I...didn't see...anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>She's seen us. What are you going to do about her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Rest assured. I'm well aware of the limits of her alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>In fact, I was always planning to use her for one of my experiments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Ex...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>You really have no morals. To use a girl as young as her for one of your experiments...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>What are you insinuating? This is for science. My research will be invaluable to breaking new ground in the field of alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Mia, you've no need to be afraid... Your sacrifice will be beneficial to the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>(Someone help! Woody!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>You should feel privileged!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>So you say a survivor of the Wratharis Research Laboratory resides here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Yes! He's been receiving compensation from the Holy Order and built a laboratory underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Tch. He, too, must be as malignant as the accursed Holy Order if he requires their support.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>According to our intel, this entire establishment is in the pocket of the Holy Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Could it be the Corpse again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I don't know all the details, but I bet this research is pretty important to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Getting ahold of their research would work in favor of our goals, and once the public finds out, trust in the Holy Order will certainly plummet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>The researcher in question appears to have been using war orphans at this institute as test subjects to continue his work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>War orphans?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>What kind of research are we talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>While he was in Wratharis, he wanted to conduct human experiments... If he's still continuing his past research, then—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>He's using the alchemy that he extracts from human flesh to refine his Philosopher's Stones. He charges the stones with alchemy to amplify their power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>The test subjects...don't survive the process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Dang them all to hell! What do they think we humans are?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>They lie, they deceive, and they distort everything for their own personal gain. The Holy Order is the blight that rots this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Lord Zahar, shall we interrupt them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>We shall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>No! Noooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Quiet, brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>We're being attacked! We can't let what we're doing here get out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Take the girl and your research with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>B-by myself?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Isn't that obvious?! We'll handle the rest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Come for me once you're done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Let go! Someone help!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Shut up, brat! You're coming with me! I'll make you into one of my lab rats!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Yaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Which way to your underground lab?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>You won't get any further! Aaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Haargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Take this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Gaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Lord Zahar, there's a hidden doorway here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Well-spotted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>The place has been stripped clean. They've taken all of their research with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>What in the world?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Ngh... Ugh... Aaah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>What did they do to him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>How pitiful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Huff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Lord...Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Forgive me, boy. Your flesh and blood will aid us on our path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>We've found a secret passage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>After him! We must acquire his research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Spica? Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>R-right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Huff... Huff... Huff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Hic... Hic...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Hurry up! They're going to catch up to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>I hear whispers from the shadows within me... Telling me to eradicate those wallowing in evil ambitions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Long time no see. Do you remember me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Y-you were the vice captain of the Knights of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Well, well... I'm pleased you remember me. Unfortunately, I can't say I remember your name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Wh-what are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>My lord desires your research. Won't you give me what you've got wrapped in your arms?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>No! It's mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Research gained from the lives of children...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Ga...haha... Any good research requires sacrifice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>You're right...but your approach is shortsighted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Worry not, we'll make better use of your research than you ever did. The world shall see the fruits of your labor in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>I'm not giving you a scrap of my research! Have you forgotten? I'm an alchemist as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Give me your alchemy! I'm going to kill him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Noooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Let go of her, you slimeball!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Uuuurrrrrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Huff... Huff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Ila, you did well fending him off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Save your praises! I'm telling you, waiting for an opening isn't my style!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Bah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Girl, you don't need to fear us. We have no intention of hurting you. Get out of—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>I think not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>The Corpse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Corvus, we're surrounded!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>You won't be getting away with our research, and the girl won't be leaving here alive. Only death awaits those who have witnessed our dark side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>As my lord would say... I'd expect nothing less from the accursed Holy Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Foolish words from a has-been assassin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Corvus, we've been sent here to eliminate you. This is where you die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Corvus! There're too many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Tch... Evil Eye, unleash your gaze!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Raaaaaarrrrrrgggh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>W-whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Ngh! Who knew you were this powerful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>I can't have you looking down on me. I didn't stand side by side with him all those years just for show.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>How rude of me... I apologize for underestimating you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>However, that doesn't change the fact that you're surrounded and outnumbered... We can't have you underestimating us, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>Corvus, what do we do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>Ila, trust the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Huh? What are you saying at a time like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Our lord is the King of Darkness, savior of the shadows, and a god among us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>Diiiie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>Corvus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>I forbid you from killing one of my men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>He...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>Lord Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>We have been awaiting your presence, my lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>As to be expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>Ila, are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>I'm just peachy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>What about you...squirt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>I-I'm okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>Poor thing. You've been through a lot, but everything will be fine now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>Wh-who are you all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>We are those who have answered the summons. We are the King of Darkness' Shadow Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>Shadow...Army?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>Zahar! You are nothing but a ghost from Wratharis' past! How long do you intend to be a thorn in our side?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>Pfft, a ghost of Wratharis? Foolish mortals! I am the King of Darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240</td>
<td>Zahar, the Shadow Messiah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>241</td>
<td>Today, we will finally rid ourselves of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I'm afraid that won't be happening on this occasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>243</td>
<td>We're out of here!</td>
