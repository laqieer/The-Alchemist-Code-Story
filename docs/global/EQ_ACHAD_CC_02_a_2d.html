<td>Hold on! Hear me out, okay? This baby responds to all kinda stimuli; voice, touch, you name it! Suitable for both long and short range, defense, offense, heavy infantry...whatever you want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>I don't know. Does it even work? It looks kinda crummy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Researcher</td>
<td>Well, that all depends on who you hook it up to. It responds to the owner's brain waves, you see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Right. That sounds like a convenient way to blame any defects on the customer.</td>

<tr>

<td>Say what you like. I doubt a skeptical fellow like you would be compatible with it, anyway.</td>

<td>Well, there's a fresh perspective. These war orphans aren't normally treated like humans.</td>

<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Listen. A greedy moneylender used to live here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>He left behind his massive safe and everything. But before he scarpered, I got him to tell me how to open it.</td>

<tr>

<td>Now I use it to hide stuff I don't want stolen.</td>

<td>*Drool*</td>

<tr>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>It's tasty. Much better than blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Uhh... What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>We never had enough food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>So you drank blood instead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>My stomach was always empty. My throat was always dry. But the water was too dirty to drink.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>I was told to drink the blood of corpses if I was hungry or thirsty. But then they laughed at me when I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>Back then, Bianca and I were always together. She told me I could drink her blood instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>I said no, at first. I didn't want to hurt her. But Bianca told me it'd be okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>I really didn't want to drink her blood...but I was so hungry. I couldn't stop myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>She sounds like a good friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>I wish I could thank her, and...tell her how sorry I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Shall we go tell her together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>They found me crying on the street, and made me a slave. So I stopped crying. I laughed once, in the company of a fellow slave, and was harshly punished. So I stopped laughing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>I flew into a rage, but they only laughed at me. So I stopped getting angry. I tried to reason with them, but nothing I said seemed to matter. So I stopped talking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>Even apologies or expressions of gratitude were unwelcome. We weren't worthy of kissing the soles of their boots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Sounds like you got the short end of the stick no matter what you did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>I had no choice. If I didn't do what they wanted, Bianca would have ended up in the same situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>And now I'll never get to tell her...anything. Not even goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>Unghh... Bianca... I-I just want to say...th-thank you! A-and I... I'm so sorry! Ungh... Waaaaaah!</td>

<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Hey. How's Dead Nine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>He hasn't woken up yet. He's barely even stirred. The injuries he incurred while protecting me in Veda were severe, so...it might take a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>A m-monster?</td>
</tr>

</tr>

<td>Kill. Must...kill.</td>
</tr>

<td>"She's the artificial maiden! The beast of war! That's right, give it up for...AMU!!!"</td>
</tr>

<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yikes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>"Amu! Amu! Amu! Amu!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Geez! Spill your food everywhere, why don't you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>No. Yes. I will do my best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>You'd better clean that up. I'm not doing it for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>"Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>I am a beast of war. Amu...must kill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Oh, heck no. It's like she's been brainwashed or something..</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>What happened to this child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Haa... You know what I always say about brats, women, and animals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>That you hate them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>That any man who raises his hand against a woman is worse than a dog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Doesn't that make you worse than a dog?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Which is exactly why I hate 'em. I'm already enough of a piece of crap, you know? I don't need to get any worse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>In this particular situation, at least it's self-defense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Sure. Let's go with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Sorry about this. It's nothing personal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>You got something to say, Amu? Speak up. Call me whatever name you want. Tell me that the food tasted terrible. Tell me you wanted something better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>If you've got a complaint, don't hold back. I wanna hear it.</td>
