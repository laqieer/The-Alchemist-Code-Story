<td>I want to give you what you desire, but it is only after our wishes are fulfilled that we realize the depth of our hunger.</td>

<td>Vanir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I will call to you, and grant you power one last time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Because I'm afraid of making another mistake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And I do not wish for you to fail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm not so sure about this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hold on! Hear me out, okay? This baby responds to all kinda stimuli; voice, touch, you name it! Suitable for both long and short range, defense, offense, heavy infantry...whatever you want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I don't know. Does it even work? It looks kinda crummy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well, that all depends on who you hook it up to. It responds to the owner's brain waves, you see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Right. That sounds like a convenient way to blame any defects on the customer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Say what you like. I doubt a skeptical fellow like you would be compatible with it, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, there's no need to rush into making a purchase. Take your time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>By the way, do you know this brat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh, she's quite famous in the underworld. Is she a recent acquisition of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hell no. I'm not into that kind of thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well, there's a fresh perspective. These war orphans aren't normally treated like humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Don't follow me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I hate brats, women, and animals. A lot. So stay away from me. Got it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I thought I told you to stop following me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Seriously! Stop it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If you think I'm going to feed you again, you're dead wrong! I just... had a lot going on that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I didn't want to eat alone. That's all it was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Thank you for the meal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Are you hungry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You wanna grab a bite to eat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Thanks for the meal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>So you are hungry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Just say what's on your mind, girl! I don't have time for games.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'll do my best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Listen. A greedy moneylender used to live here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>He left behind his massive safe and everything. But before he scarpered, I got him to tell me how to open it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Now I use it to hide stuff I don't want stolen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>*Drool*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That's right. Plenty of food in here too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Umgf...nom...snf...mmgf!</td>

<tr>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>*Slurp* *Slurp* *Gulp* Mmgf...nom...mmf...umgf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You've got quite the appetite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>*Munch* *Munch* *Munch* Omnom...mmm...mmgf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>*Gulp*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Enjoying yourself, I hope?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yeah? Tasty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If you're done, let's get going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It's tasty. Much better than blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Uhh... What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>We never had enough food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>So you drank blood instead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>My stomach was always empty. My throat was always dry. But the water was too dirty to drink.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I was told to drink the blood of corpses if I was hungry or thirsty. But then they laughed at me when I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Back then, Bianca and I were always together. She told me I could drink her blood instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I said no, at first. I didn't want to hurt her. But Bianca told me it'd be okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I really didn't want to drink her blood...but I was so hungry. I couldn't stop myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>She sounds like a good friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I wish I could thank her, and...tell her how sorry I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Shall we go tell her together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>They found me crying on the street, and made me a slave. So I stopped crying. I laughed once, in the company of a fellow slave, and was harshly punished. So I stopped laughing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I flew into a rage, but they only laughed at me. So I stopped getting angry. I tried to reason with them, but nothing I said seemed to matter. So I stopped talking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Even apologies or expressions of gratitude were unwelcome. We weren't worthy of kissing the soles of their boots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Sounds like you got the short end of the stick no matter what you did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I had no choice. If I didn't do what they wanted, Bianca would have ended up in the same situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>And now I'll never get to tell her...anything. Not even goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Unghh... Bianca... I-I just want to say...th-thank you! A-and I... I'm so sorry! Ungh... Waaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>*Sniffle*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't wipe your nose on me! I don't want your snot stains on my nice, black coat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Unghh... *Sniffle*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Dammit! You little...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>My name is Amu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>My name. It's Amu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>So what?! You're just an annoying little brat in my eyes, squirt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Excuse me... Nihil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Hey. How's Dead Nine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>He hasn't woken up yet. He's barely even stirred. The injuries he incurred while protecting me in Veda were severe, so...it might take a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>A m-monster?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Y-yes. Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Oi, squirt! What'sâ€”?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>"Ladies and gentlemen! It's what you've all been waiting for!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Kill. Must...kill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>"What will happen when man and beast clash? It's the pure of heart versus the wild and wicked! Will we see innocence prevail over the evils of this world?!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>"She's the artificial maiden! The beast of war! That's right, give it up for...AMU!!!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Yikes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>"Amu! Amu! Amu! Amu!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Geez! Spill your food everywhere, why don't you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>No. Yes. I will do my best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>You'd better clean that up. I'm not doing it for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>"Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I am a beast of war. Amu...must kill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Oh, heck no. It's like she's been brainwashed or something..</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>What happened to this child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Haa... You know what I always say about brats, women, and animals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>That you hate them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>That any man who raises his hand against a woman is worse than a dog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Doesn't that make you worse than a dog?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Which is exactly why I hate 'em. I'm already enough of a piece of crap, you know? I don't need to get any worse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>In this particular situation, at least it's self-defense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Sure. Let's go with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Sorry about this. It's nothing personal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>You got something to say, Amu? Speak up. Call me whatever name you want. Tell me that the food tasted terrible. Tell me you wanted something better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>If you've got a complaint, don't hold back. I wanna hear it.</td>
</tr>
