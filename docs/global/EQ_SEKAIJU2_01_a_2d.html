<td>Led here from the land of Arcania, in which Yggdrasil, the great tree, pierces the sky...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Our three adventurers, Fencer, Harbinger, and Shaman put an end to the war ravaging the continent of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>However, their inquisitive minds unsatisfied, the three young women continued to seek out adventure in Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Their journey goes on, even now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Haaa... Harbinger and Shaman are probably super worried about me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I can't believe I fell into a trap in that cave and got separated from everyone! I'm such an idiot... I'm so sorry, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hmm, actually... Exploring a cave, getting separated from your friends...and then a heartfelt reunion with them at the end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is what adventure is all about! Heh, this is actually kinda exciting! I'm definitely gonna find those two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What am I saying? I can't afford to stand around yapping, I gotta get going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh?! Wh-what was that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Aaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...lp...me...elp...me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wh-who is that?! Wh-what did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>H-he...lp...me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Help me?! Is someone calling for help?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrggggghhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wh-what was that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ow... Goodness, what was that all of a sudden?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ngh... Wh-what is this light?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Everyone, are you all right?! Actually, before you answer that; who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That is what I would like to know! State your names and titles immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Shouldn't you start by giving your own name and title first? Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wh-what is the meaning of that ridiculously enormous tower?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I-I can't see Yggdrasil! We're not in High Lagaard anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hmm...? Are you adventurers as well? I am Sovereign, adventurer of Armoroad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I don't fully understand this situation yet...but in any case, I'm a Protector of Etria—and an adventurer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm Gunner, from High Lagaard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Um... I guess I'll introduce myself, too. I'm Fencer, from Arcania.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>So... You guys must be adventurers from the other world, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>O-other world?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yep. We're currently in a place known as the continent of Babel, but what I want to know is why the worlds have become linked again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Maybe that cry for help I heard earlier had something to do with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wh-what?! I heard that as well! All of a sudden, I was enveloped in a radiant light and I heard someone cry "Help me!" Then I found myself here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I heard it as well, but what did you mean about the worlds being linked?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Not too long ago, our world became linked with this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>At that time, some monsters from our world wandered into Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Wait, I know! You guys came here through the Door of Truth, right? Did that weird little girl, Ouroboros, say anything to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The Door of Truth? Ouroboros? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>H-huh? You're telling me you didn't come here through the Door of Truth?! Th-that's so weird. That's how we got here, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wh-who is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I am Shenmei! Are you the ones who called me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huh? What are these clothes? Wh-why am I dressed like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What are you all in a dither about? The better question is—who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm not sure, but I think she might be what's called a Phantom. They're meant to be summoned by using something known as Alchemy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But none of you know how to use that, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>H-huh?! Then who summoned me? More importantly, why am I wearing these weird clothes?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm a pirate, but now I look like a dancer for some reason!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Maybe when the worlds became linked, some Alchemy or...something got mixed up in it all and you were called here by accident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I've met someone like that before, but it looks like there aren't any weird side effects this time... Probably.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The worlds became linked? What do you mean by...weird side effects?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>All of this information is starting to get incredibly confusing. I feel a headache coming on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Me, too. For her... Um, for Shenmei's sake, let's go over what happened from the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wait! Something's coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>M-monsters?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>That means enemies! We can talk after we've taken them down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>L-linked?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hmmm... It sounds like that voice led us all into this world.</td>
