<td>Hmph. What kind of nun abets the enemy in escaping?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You're not the enemy.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We're all people of Babel. We feel the same grief and experience the same pain.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The only thing that separates us is our kingdoms of birth. The words enemy and ally are just labels.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A very nun-like perspective—a brilliantly humanistic way of thinking. But, you speak in ideals. There's no realism to what you say.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's an answer, someone born in Envylia and pacified by peace, would say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No! I'm also—</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Right. You were born in Wratharis as well.</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What? How do you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You, too, still live within a twisted version of the truth. You don't know what the true reality is.</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Agatha!</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Agatha! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>How dare you try to take her! There'll be no mercy for you. We'll crush you here and now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Did you...deceive me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>N-no!</td>

<td>Seeing Agatha's panic, Logi and Dias furiously summon their phantoms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Agatha, we're coming for you!</td>

<td>Surrender, Sabareta! There's nowhere for you to run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It'll be troublesome to let all of you live. Let the wrath of Wratharis consume and scatter you!</td>

<td>025</td>
<td>Just as they are a hair breath away from conflict, Agatha leaps out in front of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Agatha! What're you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Get out of the way, Agatha!</td>

<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I won't! Put away your swords!</td>

<td>Sabareta contemplates this for a while. Then, he orders the Lizard Brigade to retreat.</td>

<td>Wait, Sabareta!</td>

<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>As Logi attempts to pursue Sabareta, Agatha spreads her arms out wide to block his path.</td>

<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Agatha?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What are you thinking?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Just give me...a little time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I've my way of fighting. I promise I won't make things worse. Let me talk to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>As she speaks, Sabareta's phantom appears in the blink of an eye and takes Agatha away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
