<td>Agh... Impossible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Heh, I learned these skills directly from a Saga soothsayer! If you want some more, I can make a serious effort this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wha—? Aaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Phew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Impressive. So you said you were an apprentice to a famed soothsayer of Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yeah. You heard me, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Training with her was tough and ruthless. But thanks to her, I'm much more powerful than before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh, she acts tough with her apprentices? Hard to imagine considering how lenient she is with her own personal appearance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, nothing. Tell me, why did you choose to be said soothsayer's apprentice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well... That's sort of a long story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Are you not here to visit your mother? Now is the perfect time to share all the details of your time away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's one way to see it, I guess. All right, fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>After Mother died of illness, that man took me in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But because I had no talent for the military, I was nothing more than an unwanted responsibility to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>He barely even looked at me. Others of the household would only speak to me if they had an errand for me to take care of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Then one day, a soothsayer came to our house. She took one look at me and said—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This one's overflowing with Alchemia. It would be such a waste to have him live in seclusion here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Come with me, boy. I'll make sure you gain full control over your powers. Don't you want to be stronger?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I was so glad. It was the first time since Mother's death that I felt acknowledged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I wanted to grow stronger. So, for the first time in my life, I told him what I wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well, actually it was more like I made a request. Okay, I begged him to let me be her apprentice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Master even put in a good word for me. He allowed my apprenticeship, but on one condition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>And what was that condition?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That once I was strong enough to graduate, I would return to Wratharis and use my powers to benefit him and this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh my...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's why I have to go back to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Earlier you said you've never thought of stones having meanings, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hm? Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I would like to presume your mother knew the meaning of this stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>An onyx can be a lucky charm. It's often given to children to ward off evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>And as I've said before, it represents encounters and farewells...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I would like to believe your mother wanted you to have wonderful encounters, even after having to say farewell to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>And that her hopes were manifested in the form of the soothsayer finding you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>She must've been lovely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...Yeah, she was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Is this the one? This is that noble's grave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh yeah, I saw with my own eyes the jewels and treasure being buried with the body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Let's dig it out quick! Not like anybody can spend all that in hell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Wh-what are they...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>How despicable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>They tread upon the resting souls of the dead, insulting the loved ones left behind, for the sole purpose of enriching their purses. How wretched!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wretched indeed. I can't let them get away with this in front of my mother!</td>
</tr>
