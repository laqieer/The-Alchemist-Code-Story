<td>Where...? Where am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No, I...I know this place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Is that you, great Sephiron? So you have not yet been lost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Please! Send me a sign! Show me what path is left for me to follow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I humbly beg of you, please show me the way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well, well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What do we have here? I didn't expect to find such a juicy catch while fishing through such pitiable wails and lamentations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Who goes there? You are trespassing on the hallowed ground of Sephiron!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I see. You must be one of the Protectors. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that you would make such an assumption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I am Ouroboros. I am the bond between truth and the world, the Observer of Destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ouroboros? What do you mean by "the bond between truth and the world"?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A beautiful reaction, Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This proves to me that your tribe has chosen the proper successor to the position of Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But all that has now come to an end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What is that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The Sephira have guided these lands for over a thousand years...but all that has now come to an end with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>An end...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. An inevitability of this world is that those defeated lose what has been passed on to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is that not how you humans have built the histories of this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Then why am I here? Why was I summoned before the Door of Truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I myself wish to see that question answered. Is it simply chance, or perhaps...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Your spirit is a mere ember of what it was. As you are now, you cannot blaze a new trail for the future, let alone bring the threads of the past together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Remember, Protector, how harsh the path you have taken to come here has been.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What sweet memories of the past have you lost? What joys and moments of peace have been stripped away? What future has been crushed by forces you could not control?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What you seek lies in the answers to those questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Remember...? I was... Wait... Why was I wandering the desert all alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Very good... Now we will see how brightly might you shine once you have regained your memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Show me the flame that you once were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It all started when...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I was heading out to the royal capital of Gluttony as I had been commanded...</td>
