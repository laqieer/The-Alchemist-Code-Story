<td>Hm. Looks like we managed to get through the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey, Prince? Aren't you a little hungry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>True. I do feel like I could eat something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>H-hold on...does this mean...dood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hey, Prinny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I knew it, dood! Ye-yes, Prince?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Go procure something for us to eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I knew it all along! That being said, how am I supposed to find food here, dood...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>My eye tells me that...there's a village a little up ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What? Really? Well, that's perfect! All right, Prinny! Off with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes, yes. Understood, dood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If you're going, then I'm going with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It looks like we've succeeded in infiltrating the village, dood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hey... Is it even necessary to sneak around?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Shh! Miss Rosa, lower your voice, dood! We're just about to steal some food, dood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If they find us, we'll be in big trouble, dood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh dear. Stealing, huh? What a naughty thing you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well, I am the vassal of an Overlord! Besides, I don't have any money, dood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh? You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Not good, dood! They've found us! Run, dooood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hey! Hold on a second!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>They're late! Where's my food!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It looks like our best option would be to go directly to the village ourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Munch, munch, munch! Whew! This fish cuisine is absolutely delicious, dood!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This beef sauté is simple, but also fantastic. It's rare with blood dripping down it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah! Please, eat as much as you can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Thanks, dooood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'll show you where you can take your "Thanks, dooood!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I come all this way because you don't come back and look what I find! Arghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ah! Prince?! I forgot, doood! They suddenly started showering us with hospitality, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hey, are you guys also friends of this strange bird? Welcome!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Well, did you find the spices?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Prince! It seems like this person is mistaking us and the Prinny for someone else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>They seem to be welcoming us, so we might as well take advantage of this opportunity to obtain food!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ah. Right! Well then, we might as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Phew... I'm stuffed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We're so happy to see how satisfied you appear. By the way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>How is that rabbit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hmph?! Did you say a rabbit?! Was it yellow?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>O-oh...hm? I thought you were friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Where did that yellow rabbit go?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huh? Umm... To Envylia's castle town...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Whoaaa?! Oh no! It's them again!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Phantom Soldiers again...? I've had enough of the whims of fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I don't know, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hey, you over there! Stop talking nonsense, and let's hurry to this castle town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh?! We're not gonna fight?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What?! Why would I need to fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But, at this rate, this village will...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The yellow rabbit is way more important than that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You brute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Freeloader!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ungrateful, dood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Prinny?! Even you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>These villagers provided you with food; you owe them a debt, dood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Why would I, an Overlord, repay a debt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Prince! This is your chance to gain popularity! Show them the depth of an Overlord's pocket, dood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hm. Do you think so? Well then, fine. The meal was pretty delicious, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Some light exercise after eating—that's all this is! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Sigh. Dood.</td>
