<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Boy, just look at all this commotion. This is a “wight day fair,” you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Almost! With White Day just around the corner, this event sets up shops selling sweet treats from each country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Seeing how you can eat your fill of the sweets from all over the continent, it's no wonder there's such a hub-bub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Iyazoi and I are on decoration duty! We'll make it a venue that puts A+ smiles on everyone's faces!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah, what she said. I put up a bunch of drawings to get everyone in a festive mood. Look, this one's Tsuru! Not bad, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...A+ for ingenuity, that's for sure. Full marks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That disaster on paper aside, the hall's really come together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Still, we're sure to have a ruckus on our hands with so many people in one place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Brace yourselves, we have a full day of guard duty ahead of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Okay, but can someone explain what a "wight day" is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Now that you mention it, I have no idea either. Some kind of sugar-centric celebration?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>According to the fair organizers, White Day is a day to gift sweets as a way to show gratitude to someone who's shown you similar sentiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You don't say...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A day to express your gratitude, huh? That's an idea I can get behind! Now I'm all gassed-up to make sure this all goes off without a hitch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(The nuance of the original White Day isn't quite the same, but oh well.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(Never thought Plumeria's misunderstanding would get this kind of traction.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(Still, taking out the "guys-only" element is better for the market, anyway.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Now then, Plumeria and I will go back to helping out the prep work. Keep your eyes peeled out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So this is the White Day Fair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Compared to the days we grew up in, this era seems a bit more peaceful. All these guys have the leeway to enjoy a shindig like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And how. They've even got traditional sweets stands—anmitsu jelly, warabi mochi, you name it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Anmitsu jelly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'll patrol that side with Tsuru. Later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Whoa, whoa, hold on! Why're we splitting up, here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Isn't it obvious? We can cover more ground that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You guys get along, and seem to work well together. I just assumed Tsuru and I ought to go another way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh, so that's your logic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I wouldn't say we're especially chummy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Besides, the hall's not all that big. There's no need to go our separate ways, is there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What's that? You don't think we should split up, either? Well, if you say so, Tsuru!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Come on, then, shall we make the rounds? Oh, I think we shall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We've done a few circuits, but nothing worth writing home about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmm? What're you gawking around for, Iyazoi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh, I'm just observing. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves, buying and eating all these confections.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>All of the people here have the wherewithal to purchase such extravagances as sweets and lollies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm happy for them, but it makes me think about those lacking the resources to partake in these festivities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Of course, I recognize the importance of our security detail. Just got me thinking, is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Iyazoi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh, and I'm combing for some inari sushi. There's got to be at least one vendor in all this hubbub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But...inari sushi isn't a sweet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What? It's plenty sweet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You're getting caught up in the semantics...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'm afraid you won't scratch your inari sushi itch here. Still, there's plenty of tasty treats to be sure. Just walking around's enough to get your stomach rumbling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That takes me back! I used to go around eyeballing other people's food, chugging down tea and imagining the seasoning of what they're eating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You've gotta be kidding me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I was exactly rolling in zeni back then. Sweets were a luxury beyond my means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The doors to my dojo were always open, but the disciples were few, and the bodyguard requests even fewer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Still, it's the path I've chosen, I regret nothing. Not that my stomach often agrees with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Say... How's Wadatsumi faring these days, you figure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Think it's a peaceful place, in need of life-giving swordhands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Beats me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hmm? What's with the crowd here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Line up here for the white marshmallow vendor! No shoving, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>This "marshmallow" confection seems pretty popular. You want one, Reimei?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Not really my thing, to be honest. I don't know if it's the scent, or the sickly sweetness or what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What's that, Tsuru? Hmm, hmm, I see. Okay, I'll leave it to you, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What's up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Something was bothering him, so he went to go check it out, is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Don't love the sound of that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>My deepest apologies, ladies and gentleman. I fear we've sold through our current stock of white marshmallows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>We'll be taking a brief respite until the next delivery arrives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You kidding me?! I've been in this line forever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Let us put in reservations for the next batch! Here, take my money!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Whoa, calm down, you lot! They sell out when they sell out, that's just the way the cookie crumbles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I know, I know, it's just... I can't take it. I need another melty morsel in my mouth, and I mean NOW!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>The way the luscious flavor lingers in your mouth... One bite's enough to get anyone addicted...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>All right, already, I get it! They've got another delivery coming, don't they? Take a seat, have a cup of tea or something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yeesh, they've finally settled down...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>That was too weird. Marshmallows shouldn't cause such pandemonium, I don't care how tasty they are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Truth, truth. Is there some sort of secret to them we're not seeing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Why might know more when Tsuru gets back. That sweet scent is what drew her attention in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>That right? Then let's wait and see what Tsurubami drudges up. The rest of us have a mission to complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>How many times do I have to say it?! You can't run a store on wishful thinking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>We've came all the way from Envylia, and this is all we've sold?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>We'll be in the red at this rate. I'm telling you, we have to get your son back and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Shut your yap! Don't say another word about him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Yo, what do you think you're doing? This is no place for Phantom Soldiers to butt in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You're not wrong, but I can't just ignore this, either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hoh boy, here we go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Calm down, you two! Cooler heads prevail, and all that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I'm just thinking of our business! Your way of doing things is behind the times!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I'm in no fix to give up my proclivities! Be it recipes or ingredients, there's no cutting corners when it comes to making our customers grin from ear to ear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Customers out there want my wares. Even if it's old school, I won't twist the convictions handed down to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>That may ring true for your regulars, but the new customers are a whole other tune! You're pidgeon-holing us, here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Well I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What's the point in making all these delicious sweets if there's no one around to eat them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>That's why our business needs to go in a new direction!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I'm telling you, master! We need to make our sweets with the mashiro flour your son developed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Mashiro flour?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>An ingredient made by our master's son. Cheap to produce, incredibly sweet, perfect for making piquant pastries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Well, sounds like a win-win all around. Sweet and cheap, even the penniless could afford some.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>No! It's delicious to be sure, but the strange addiction that follows, well, that don't sit right with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Sweets should be all about the ingredients.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>The plant mashiro flour is made from is an invasive species. You put it in my ware, you can hardly call them mine anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>The sweets I make come from Wadatsumi, and bear the mark of its hospitality. That flour lacks any such cordiality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>That bullheaded thinking's what caused your son to leave in the first place, master. All the other shops are using the flour!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>My son...will return, in time. No one loves my sweets more than him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>If anyone can understand how important ingredients are, it's my boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Master...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Our shop's motto is "baking sweets that bring sincere smiles to our buyers." I won't betray that adage, no way no how.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Your ideals are admirable, master, no one's doubting that. It's just...if this keeps up...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Oh dear, there they go. What can be done about those two?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Whatever it is, it's nothing you or I are equipped to handle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Behind the times, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>The ideals of the Sosenko are admirable, to be sure. Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>A sword that can't cut, cannot save a single soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Hello? Earth to Creto?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Oh, sorry. Don't mind me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Hey, everyone. I was looking for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>What's the word, Ankh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I'm actually in a bit of a bind. That shop from before, where that chaos occurred? Their next shipment of marshmallows has yet to arrive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>All of the customers are in a tizzy. I'm having a devil of a time calming them down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>You think something happened to the merchant? Right, we'd better go check it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Well, this is the route the merchant had taken. I wonder what happened to him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Search me. Could be a thief, or maybe—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Look, over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>What?! What a fearsome monster horde. What's making them swarm here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>S-someone! Help! Save meeeee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>!!!!</td>
</tr>
