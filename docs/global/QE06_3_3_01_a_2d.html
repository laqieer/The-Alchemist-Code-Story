</tr>
<tr>

<td>That's no concern of yours. All you need to know is the power of the Dismortants—a power with no weak point, which you cannot possibly overcome!</td>

<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>Which is why I intend to eliminate those pesky variables from the equation. After dealing with you two, we will collect the Sumeragi from its resting place in this castle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>We've also learned of a survivor from the Rising Ashes bloodline who allegedly wields Kagutsuchi. But the means to acquire that art has been lost to time, so we give that rumor little credence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>Nonetheless, if we can procure the Sumeragi, we have determined that all variables will have been effectively nullified.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>Everything in the palm of your hand, is it? Presumptuous is putting it lightly.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>Spare me your theologizing. There are no spirits. Thorough analysis and repeated experimentation are the only things in which to place one's faith without playing the fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>You're wrong. You're so wrong! I know, because...I've been entrusted with a spirit beyond my own. And I intend to see that trust through!</td>
