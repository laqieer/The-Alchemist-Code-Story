<td>Tehre!</td>

<td>Unfortunately, compared to my power, you are nothing but a worthless clay puppet! Hyaaaaah!</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>For the sake of Saga's future, you will not stop me here.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>By the Matter! Tehre, you really are unbelievably strong!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well now, shall we get started then? Take this!</td>

<td>Tehre, what are you doing?</td>

<td>I wanted to know whether the core would be destroyed if we eliminated the shadow. Unfortunately, it appears it won't be that simple.</td>

<td>Physical attacks don't appear to have any effect on it. Then...how about this?!</td>

<td>It's able to deflect even Tehre's attacks?! How are we supposed to—?</td>

<td>Quiet! I have more in my arsenal. O earth, infuse me with thy breath of life...and envelop all in your deep embrace!</td>

<td>There's a knack to dealing with such Matter as is infusing the power of earth into the core... It's different from our own Matter, which are simply massive reservoirs of energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Without Matter powering it, I expect I should be able to destroy the empty husk of the core from inside!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>O tranquil breath of life... O great and endless bounty... Grant thy strength unto me! Yaaaaaaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Finally! It has been destroyed!</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We just have to do this three more times and it'll be over. We're pressed for time. Let's make our way back.</td>

<td>Time to go! We cannot assume what will happen now that it has lost one of its cores.</td>

<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>

<td>Guh!</td>
