<td>Waginau, you have crossed into a realm that your physical form should not have intrinsically been able to reach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>This is the Shell of the World—the place where the Pursuer, Nimul's, eyes were opened to the Truth of Alchemy. This is where it all began.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Is that your sense of responsibility as a warrior of Sephira, and his duty-bound attendant, talking? Or do you speak these words as his friend?</td>

<td>The Stairs of Creation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>He's taken the first step into the beginnings of a new world. He's begun the Ceremony of Creation.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/drg_wagi_wiz_01.png" alt="Waginau" height="128"><br>Waginau</td>
<td>Wait, the Ceremony of...? Nimul had rejected that ceremony, saying that another path must be taken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>The Infinite Serpent must have wrapped themselves around his throat, influencing his mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>You can still stop him. There is still time. That is, of course, if you are willing to make the appropriate sacrifice.</td>

<td>The ceremony requires my life, does it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>To stop Nimul, you must earn the right to stand shoulder to shoulder, upon the same stage as he.</td>

<tr>

<td>This place gives you that opportunity.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/drg_wagi_wiz_01.png" alt="Waginau" height="128"><br>Waginau</td>
<td>All right. So what must I do, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>You must consume my memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>If there is something you lack, then all you need to do is take it from another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>If you cannot reach a certain height through diligent training, you must simply evolve yourself into a being who can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>That is the nature of Nimul's creation: Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Change through usurpation... Rebirth through plundering... A forceful impelling of the world, in defiant rejection of stagnation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>If you are willing to act in accordance with these doctrines, there is yet a path left for you to take.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/drg_wagi_wiz_01.png" alt="Waginau" height="128"><br>Waginau</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/drg_wagi_wiz_01.png" alt="Waginau" height="128"><br>Waginau</td>

<td>But... What would become of you if I did?</td>
