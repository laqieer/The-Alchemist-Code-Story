<td>Wh-where...? What have I...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Glad to see you awake, Seeker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Zafeiris? Right... We were enveloped in that bright light, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wait... Adaleigh! Yna! Where are they?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Do you not remember? As the light approached, you used all the power you had to save them both.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I did? I have no memory of this. And on that note, where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So your actions were done unconsciously? I did not expect the assimilation to have already progressed so far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I-I must return to Nimul and the others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That is not possible at this moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What? Why not?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Waginau, you have crossed into a realm that your physical form should not have intrinsically been able to reach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is the Shell of the World—the place where the Pursuer, Nimul's, eyes were opened to the Truth of Alchemy. This is where it all began.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This is an opportunity that should not have been. It is something we never had a chance to even dream of before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I don't care what sort of opportunity it is! How do I get back to where I was?! I must protect Nimul, or else—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Is that your sense of responsibility as a warrior of Sephira, and his duty-bound attendant, talking? Or do you speak these words as his friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Zafeiris?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Regardless of which it may be, it is simply not possible for you to return. There is something you must do first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What do you mean? What do I have to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The Pursuer, Nimul, has reached heights comparable to our god.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The Stairs of Creation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>He's taken the first step into the beginnings of a new world. He's begun the Ceremony of Creation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wait, the Ceremony of...? Nimul had rejected that ceremony, saying that another path must be taken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The Infinite Serpent must have wrapped themselves around his throat, influencing his mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You can still stop him. There is still time. That is, of course, if you are willing to make the appropriate sacrifice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Is it...truly possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Are you not going to ask what the appropriate sacrifice is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's rather obvious what's being asked of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The ceremony requires my life, does it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>To stop Nimul, you must earn the right to stand shoulder to shoulder, upon the same stage as he.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This place gives you that opportunity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>All right. So what must I do, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You must consume my memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If there is something you lack, then all you need to do is take it from another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If you cannot reach a certain height through diligent training, you must simply evolve yourself into a being who can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That is the nature of Nimul's creation: Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Change through usurpation... Rebirth through plundering... A forceful impelling of the world, in defiant rejection of stagnation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If you are willing to act in accordance with these doctrines, there is yet a path left for you to take.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You mean...I am to wield Alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>With that sword in your hand, I entreat you to run me through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You wish to be pierced by this blade, which holds the capacity to slay dragons? I do recall Yna mentioning the blade being engraved with Alchemy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But... What would become of you if I did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Do not worry about me. I am merely a vestige, of sorts, destined to vanish without a trace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Th-This is the Cursed Beasts'...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>This is my true nature—the mark of our sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Now... Do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>All right. Show me everything... Your powers and memories alike!</td>
</tr>
