<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>There was a rebellion among the Holy Guard, and Zain got murdered...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's the only thing I had heard, so I was convinced that the new Lord Commander must have been responsible for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So, you aren't the one who killed Zain then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Right, Kanon was not responsible, and neither in Captain Cadanova's case. He wished for it himself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But... it's true that I bear responsibility in both their deaths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's a fact that I wasn't able to stop Captain Kudanstein when it happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova also died because... I couldn't help to avoid it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But that's just in hindsight, isn't it? Kanon, I'm sure you don't deserve a single blame in this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I had made a faulty judgment. What can I say... I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions without making sure myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's okay.<br>It can't be helped that you made that conclusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But... who would have thought that Master Yogi Ku had passed away...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Does that mean we'll have to give up on Excalibur's restoration?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Couldn't Miuna have inherited her father's craftsmanship?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Nimul, who in ancient times laid eyes on the world on the other side of the Door of Truth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>ended up destroying the Grand Excelsior, and the Tower of Babel on his return to our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It is said that the Sacred Sword Excalibur was forged from the raw materials of the tools used by Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh?<br>What are you talking about, so suddenly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And from those ancient times, the Tribe of Ku passed on this craftsmanship from generation to generation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I highly doubt that Yogi Ku wouldn't have passed on such an important thing on to the next generation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see!<br>So, Miuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's true that I've inherited his craftsmanship. It's in my blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>As I thought!<br>So, does that mean...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Wait a moment.<br>It's true that I have the ability to restore Excalibur...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>but whether I'll do it or not, that's a different question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I only ever intended to maintain Excalibur for Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I never intended to restore Excalibur for any other owner. I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh?! But... she inherited Excalibur from Lord Zain, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Wait, Chloe. You don't mean to maintain it if it isn't in Lord Zain's possession anymore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That means that Lord Zain must have been very precious to you, wasn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Would you mind if I asked you about your connection with Lord Zain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>This place is pretty big, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes, it's so big that it would make a good training hall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Exactly. Whenever I'm here, I feel as if I can still hear them breathing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Zain and Cadanova...<br>they used to spar here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh?<br>Lord Zain and Lord Cadanova? Here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Whenever they were waiting for Excalibur to be restored, they would spar against each other right here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>In a way, this place was something like their secret sparring ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I see! So you must have learned their abilities from watching them here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I suppose so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It was also here that I met them for the first time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>When I was a child, they always interacted with me without showing any annoyance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I really used to enjoy watching the two of them competing against each other so intensely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Since I didn't have any siblings, they were like my two older brothers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Just because I wasn't strong enough, you lost two precious people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>How did such a crybaby become the Lord Commander, hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>However much you may mourn, you can never go back to the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>If you don't show a little bit of dignity, I won't be able to approve of you as the Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...!<br>Does that mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>None other than Zain and Cadanova gave you their approval, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If that's so, I'll at least need to listen to your plea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Miuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>However, in order to restore Excalibur, I do have a single condition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>A condition?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I want you to kill the one who killed Zain. This man named Kudanstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>If you can promise me that, then I don't mind giving Excalibur a try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
