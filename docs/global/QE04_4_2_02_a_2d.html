<td>Tch, Jam that mimics humans!</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Glurrp!</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>Tina, watch out!</td>

<td>Icicle Edge!</td>

<td>Thanks, Lisbeth!</td>

<td>What is this? Why would Jam take human form?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Dang it! There's just so much we don't know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There's no point mulling over it! Let's find Georgios before more of them show up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Georgios! Is this Beelzebub? It looks like it's in some sort of cocoon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Take this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Was that...the power of purification?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is just the beginning!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>At last! Beelzebub is mine again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What did you do just now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I poured my purification power into Beelzebub and severed its connection with the ancient dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It will take some time, but soon I will be able to wield Beelzebub again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Once it is completely cleansed of the dragon's dominion, I will be able to reverse the preemptive curse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What do you mean by..."reverse"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>By severing Beelzebub's connection to the entity that bore the curse and infusing it with my purification power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I can reverse Beelzebub's inherent nature...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Thus, I can change it from a "preemptive curse" to a "subsequential blessing." It is a feat only my clan can perform; not even Matter can achieve the same effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Now, I shall fulfill my life's purpose! Hyaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But Georgios! Your life will be in danger if you use your purification power again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Fear for my life will not stop me from doing what must be done! Yaaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Georgios, are youâ€”?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Georgios, heads up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...?! Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hmph. Desperate to recover Beelzebub, are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's the tentacle we saw when the dragon was resurrected!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Take this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I don't need help from the likes of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Fine! We have to get out of here quickly, Mocca! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Glurrrrrrrrrrrp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We're surrounded again! That tentacle's enough trouble as it is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We'll return to the outside via the opening in its spine! We've got Beelzebub! Let's get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>C'mon! No one dies on my watch!</td>
