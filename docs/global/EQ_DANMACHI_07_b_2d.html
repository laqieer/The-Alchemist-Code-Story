<td>002</td>
<td>Uuurrrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oooooooooraaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...Did we get it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We won!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The demons are all taken care of, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's a victory all around, Bell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>All thanks to you, Kevin and Ila. Not to mention Ais, of courseâ€”and you, Goddess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah! Go, team!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Thanks to...the goddess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You got a problem with that, Kevin?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No, no, of course not, Goddess! Heaven forfend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hmph! The nerve of this guy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh! Is that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hey! You're that diva who snatched Bell away from our world in the first place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I've got a bone to pick with you, putting my Bell in danger like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You have done well, boy who aspires to be a hero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hey! Listen when I'm talking to you! Heeeey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The experiments performed by those villains set off a discharge of Alchemia that spread disarray even as far as your world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Of course it was them. It had to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Now, at last, the natural order has returned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What about the children?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>They are safe and sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Bell Cranel, you have shown me one page of your hero's tale in great detail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm not a hero, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Can't you just drop the modesty already?! Sheesh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Your achievements are a part of who you are, so when people praise you for them, you should just accept it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I-I do. But I didn't accomplish any of this on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I couldn't have done it without all of my friends here helping me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So their contributions belong in that hero's tale, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ahh, okay! I can get behind that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Usually, tales like that are all about a hero coming to save the world from some impending crisis...but it'd be a real honor to be included alongside that dashing protagonist when this one's passed down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>And I'm glad to have had you by my side, Kevin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Unfortunately, this hero's tale is one that cannot be passed along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The distortions in time and space will soon mend. Your memories of this place, too, will dissolve away into nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Everything shall return to the way it was before, as if none of this ever occurred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Whatever might happen to our memories, if Bell can go back to his family, and those children are safe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That's good enough for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Your story, and your battles, will continue. As will mine. You need only turn the page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well said!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ila... Ais...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well, I guess that's how it's gonna be, Bell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No sense dragging things out. Let's get back to our Familia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yes, Goddess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>And Wallen-whatever, Loki's worried about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Loki is...worried?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You know, since we're gonna lose our memories anyway, I might as well just say it: you can be really thick-headed when it comes to people's feelings. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>And as long we're being totally honest, I've got something to tell you about Bell that might be of some interest, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Goddess, please! Not that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>We'll miss our chance to say our goodbyes, at this rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hmph. Fine. I guess I'll hang on to this particular morsel until it can do maximum damage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But aren't we going to forget everything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Oh, crap! You're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Umm, perhaps you might...hold off on all this until you get back home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I know you won't remember it, but I wanted to thank you again, Bell. There might be more bad guys around like the ones earlier, but this is my homeland, and I intend to keep fighting for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>And it's still here thanks in no small part to you! So, yeah. I owe you one, big time! Take care of yourself back in your world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You too, Kevin! ...Er, actually, do phantoms even need to take care of themselves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hahaha. Don't worry. Whoever summons me next will be well taken care of in my place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ila? Thank you, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I should be thanking you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>So...I will. Th-thank you...Bell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I'm glad we could save those children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Me too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Keep working toward that dream of yours, with your friends at your side. Promise me you will! Even if neither of us will remember it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I suppose my role here is done as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Oh, no! We're parting ways before I could even see Ais smile! Uhh... boogedy-boogedy-boo?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>No reaction to the bitter end, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hahaha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Okay. For real this time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Let's go home, Bell. You too, Wallen-something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yes, Goddess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Let's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>This story may disappear from your memories...but your hero's tale will ever be etched unto mine, Bell Cranel. Turn the page...</td>
