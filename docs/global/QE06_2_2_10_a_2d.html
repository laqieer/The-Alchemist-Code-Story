<td>…I should get going. Sorry to drop by so suddenly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey, I thought you still had some business to take care of…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>My business here is done. You really are an honest man…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>…Er…Well…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>As for me, I'm still conflicted. If you can prevent more fighting, then I welcome your strategy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But…given my position, I cannot openly support you. I wanted you to understand that... No, perhaps that's not the right word…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>... I just wanted you to hear it. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…Mitsuha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I, too, am human, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If you're serious about your goal, show me evidence that will convince the people. As the head of Wadatsumi…that is my hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And when your ideals are realized...I hope to enjoy your cooking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I say this, not as the leader of Wadatsumi, but as a human being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...Koga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…Now, don't go thinking you shouldn't come here anymore, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I told you I won't rest until I hear you say that word--"Delicious!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Don't tell me you want to stop now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>…You've got to promise to do one thing, Kaede…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>…If it ever looks like I'm about to die, will you devour me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>..!? Why are you saying this all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I know you can't devour people, so this might be a difficult request. I know that, in theory… But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I...I had a moment when I thought, "I might die without ever achieving my dream."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>… !!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The act of eating connects lives. If I die without achieving anything ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I want to be connected to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>…Koga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Of course, I don't intend to die so easily...but...I realize how monumental the task at hand is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>…So, can I ask this of you, Kaede?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…Alright. I promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>…Just don't go dying on me. You…changed my life for the better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>So, you've got to…live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>…Alright.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You've got to show me exactly what a crazy person like you can achieve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…Alright. That was kind of a depressing what-if scenario... Anyway--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I want to make a land where humans and demons living in Wadatsumi never starve--A land where food is plentiful and everyone lives together in harmony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Now, here's an uplifting what-if story about the future...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>A long, long time ago…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It's so crazy you may not believe me, but I'm serious... Listen with an open mind, Kaede.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Humans and demons fought one another, and both were desperate to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I will. I believe you when you say you're serious. So I'll listen in earnest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Demons devoured humans in order to live, and humans killed them so that they would not be devoured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Alright. But, uh…now I feel like I've been put on the spot… How shall I start--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>In the end, sadness and hatred enveloped Wadatsumi like a shroud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Cat got your tongue? You can tell me anything, Koga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Amidst the chaos, a lone human man and a lone demon woman overcame their differences and fell in love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>…I swear to you my cooking will bring peace to Wadatsumi. When that day comes…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>…Will you marry me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>…Ah--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Whaaaaat!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Whaaaaat!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Don't act so surprised. I told you the fairytale was real.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>…Er, true. But there's a big difference between listening and seeing...! I can't believe it... Is this really--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…Actual events.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>So, the moral of the story…is that food is a bridge, transcending race? Celis always says there is great power in food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>But how did they persuade each other's races? They faced too many obstacles!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's what you're about see with your own eyes. The coalescence, the unravelling, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The bond that lasted across time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>… Now, let's dive deeper. To catch a glimpse of the memories that slumber in this land.</td>
