<td>Huh...I wonder what this is. Mom?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hm? What is it, Liz?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It was stuck between this book. Is it a pressed flower?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh! That's the Stub Rule! I thought I hadn't seen it in a while, but there it is in the magic book.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Stub Rule?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's a flower that blooms deep within the forest, even in the snow. I got it from him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>From Dad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>When a man proposes, he gives flowers that don't wilt even in the cold as an expression of everlasting love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Everlasting love, huh? That sounds beautiful! I'm jealous, Mom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I didn't know about the meaning behind it, but one day he picked this flower for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's been many years since then, but I kept it pressed. I should really put it on display.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh! Hey! Be careful with that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ack! It broke...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ohh! N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's a pressed flower, so they fall apart easily I suppose. I still have my memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm so bored...it should be a crime. I wish something would happen, something that's like "BOOM!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The major terrorist incident is why we're stuck in our dormitories, right? But you know, something strange is happening...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes...something unusual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Liz is looking serious... D-don't tell me she's thinking of studying...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The snow'll never stop at this rate...Liz!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What?! Alma?! What's gotten into you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Me? What about you? What were you thinking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Um, well...it's about the Stub Rule flower...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Stub Rule?! No...no way, Liz!!! Did you...get it from someone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Who? Who gave it to you?! This is just a wild guess, but was it...um D...D...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No, no, no! I just want to go pick one myself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Pick one yourself? But you're a girl! It's supposed to be what a gentleman gives when he proposes to a girl, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Um...well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I see. You want to replace the broken Stub Rule with a new one for your mom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well, it's not a carnation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Do you think it's a bad idea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Powerful monsters lie deep inside the forest. I can't imagine leaving the dorm and going to such a place without the teacher's permissionâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Sounds fun! I'm in! I was interested in doing some snow mountain climbing myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Are you interested in the Stub Rule? Wait...is there someone you like, Alma?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Does this look like a face that's in love?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>How on earth could a superstition about eternal love come from a country where a guy turns into a bug the moment he declares it...? Talk about irony...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It's usually all just hearsay. Still, if we're gonna try to get to the bottom of it all, I'm in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Alma...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>So you came as well, Rebecca? That must mean you're in love, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I-I just didn't think it would be safe for the two of you to go alone. If something were to happen, as class chairperson I would be the one who would have to deal with it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Fine, fine. Let's just say that's what's going on.</td>
