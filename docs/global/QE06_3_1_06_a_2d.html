<tr>

<td>It only stands to reason, if your end goal is the secret art of Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>Heh. You give me too much credit, perhaps. As I said, I never expected you to be here. That part was just a pleasant surprise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Besides...there's no point involving myself with the dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>D-dead? Zeke?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>I suppose you'd have no way of knowing that, given how closed off Wadatsumi is. But it's true. The one known as the great sinner is dead and buried, along with his precious Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cele.png" alt="Celis" height="128"><br>Celis</td>
<td>It...can't be... And, what do you mean, "great sinner"?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>I'm afraid it is. And you two had a child, if I recall. His name was...Logi Crowley, was it not?</td>

<td>Logi! Don't tell me he's also...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Not quite. But now that Zeke is dead, the only two people who know the whereabouts of Kagutsuchi are you and Logi.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>Now, then. I think we've done just about enough talking for one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>Oho? I thought for sure you'd be too despondent to parry such an attack. I'm rather impressed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cele.png" alt="Celis" height="128"><br>Celis</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>Perhaps. What if I told you I was? What then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cele.png" alt="Celis" height="128"><br>Celis</td>
<td>You look down on everyone. You try to manipulate everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cele.png" alt="Celis" height="128"><br>Celis</td>
<td>Just how many lives have you trampled underfoot?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>I don't know. And I don't care to find out. All I care about is my research...and its results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>And Wadatsumi, of course. All is for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cele.png" alt="Celis" height="128"><br>Celis</td>
<td>How is any of this for Wadatsumi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>Because it's a land that barely anyone even gives a second thought to. Whether it's invaded or threatened by demons, few will even turn their heads to look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>So if we can use Wadatsumi to further our agenda, isn't that a better fate than letting it be forgotten altogether?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cele.png" alt="Celis" height="128"><br>Celis</td>
<td>No! Not at all! That's absolute madness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>Where is this rage coming from? I understand your anger over what happened with Zeke...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>But what do you care of Wadatsumi's fate? It's not even your homeland!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>No matter how much you may care for its people, you will always be an outsider here. The affairs of this country simply are not your concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cele.png" alt="Celis" height="128"><br>Celis</td>
<td>An outsider? Not my concern?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cele.png" alt="Celis" height="128"><br>Celis</td>
<td>I'm the First Squad Captain and Commander of the Blade Fox Corps! You certainly understand that much, don't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>I see. This is unexpected. I might even go so far as to call this a variable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>Failures from research and experiments are all the results of unexpected variables. I do so despise variables.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>But this being, modeled after the Discarnate Power, yet boasting regeneration and immortality alike... What shall I call it, I wonder? "Dismortant," perhaps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>My Dismortants should be untouchable. Unstoppable. And yet...I am forced to admit that there do exist variables which could unravel all my best-laid plans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cele.png" alt="Celis" height="128"><br>Celis</td>
<td>The Kagutsuchi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>The Spirit Stone Mikaboshi and Treasure Blade Sumeragi, as well. Who knows what effect they'd have on a demon's body?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cele.png" alt="Celis" height="128"><br>Celis</td>
<td>Should you really be running your mouth like this? Aren't you worried?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Certainly not. After all, as I said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cele.png" alt="Celis" height="128"><br>Celis</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>Variables are best eliminated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>We've already entered the operational phase of the Dismortant experiment. I can't let it end in failure.</td>
</tr>

<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cele.png" alt="Celis" height="128"><br>Celis</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>What need does this land have of humans, when Wadatsumi can thrive so much greater as a demon country populated entirely by Dismortants?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
