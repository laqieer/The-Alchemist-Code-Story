<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Answer me! Was Greed Dike involved with the Scarlet Flame Guard incident?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If it makes you feel any better, I was unaware you would be exiled to Wadatsumi. I was thrilled when I heard of it, of course, but that was not my doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You were involved, though. And that's all I needed to know. That makes you my enemy, and an enemy to all the others who gave their lives for nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Don't tell me... Did you get him mixed up in all this, too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Zeke Crowley, you mean? What makes you think that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It only stands to reason, if your end goal is the secret art of Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Heh. You give me too much credit, perhaps. As I said, I never expected you to be here. That part was just a pleasant surprise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Besides...there's no point involving myself with the dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Zeke Crowley. He's dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>D-dead? Zeke?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I suppose you'd have no way of knowing that, given how closed off Wadatsumi is. But it's true. The one known as the great sinner is dead and buried, along with his precious Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It...can't be... And, what do you mean, "great sinner"?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm afraid it is. And you two had a child, if I recall. His name was...Logi Crowley, was it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Logi! Don't tell me he's also...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Not quite. But now that Zeke is dead, the only two people who know the whereabouts of Kagutsuchi are you and Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And variables are best eliminated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You do have my condolences, for whatever that may be worth. But I'll admit, my gratitude extends further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Now, then. I think we've done just about enough talking for one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oho? I thought for sure you'd be too despondent to parry such an attack. I'm rather impressed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>His death... Were you a party to that as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Perhaps. What if I told you I was? What then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You look down on everyone. You try to manipulate everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Just how many lives have you trampled underfoot?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I don't know. And I don't care to find out. All I care about is my research...and its results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And Wadatsumi, of course. All is for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>How is any of this for Wadatsumi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Because it's a land that barely anyone even gives a second thought to. Whether it's invaded or threatened by demons, few will even turn their heads to look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So if we can use Wadatsumi to further our agenda, isn't that a better fate than letting it be forgotten altogether?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No! Not at all! That's absolute madness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Where is this rage coming from? I understand your anger over what happened with Zeke...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But what do you care of Wadatsumi's fate? It's not even your homeland!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No matter how much you may care for its people, you will always be an outsider here. The affairs of this country simply are not your concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>An outsider? Not my concern?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm the First Squad Captain and Commander of the Blade Fox Corps! You certainly understand that much, don't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I see. This is unexpected. I might even go so far as to call this a variable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Failures from research and experiments are all the results of unexpected variables. I do so despise variables.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But this being, modeled after the Discarnate Power, yet boasting regeneration and immortality alike... What shall I call it, I wonder? "Dismortant," perhaps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>My Dismortants should be untouchable. Unstoppable. And yet...I am forced to admit that there do exist variables which could unravel all my best-laid plans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The Kagutsuchi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The Spirit Stone Mikaboshi and Treasure Blade Sumeragi, as well. Who knows what effect they'd have on a demon's body?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Should you really be running your mouth like this? Aren't you worried?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Certainly not. After all, as I said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Variables are best eliminated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We've already entered the operational phase of the Dismortant experiment. I can't let it end in failure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Don't worry. You're just first on the list. All others who dwell in Wadatsumi will follow suit soon enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What need does this land have of humans, when Wadatsumi can thrive so much greater as a demon country populated entirely by Dismortants?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Let's put an end to this...gracefully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Struggle all you'd like, the result will be the same in the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I think you've made one fatal mistake here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>The Scarlet Flame Guard may have been purged and dismantled, but that doesn't mean its fire has ever truly been extinguished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You think I want to protect Wadatsumi just because I'm a Blade Fox?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>"We shall not allow ourselves to be blind to the plight of those who can be saved."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>"There is no prejudice in the Scarlet Flame Guard."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>"Respect none who wield the sword without heart."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>And..."Dedicate your sword...to the pursuit of...justice"!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What...is this...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Coming to Wadatsumi, I learned and was made aware of a great many truths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Among them, that I must never hang my head in shame, no matter how many people dear to me I may lose. There's too much left for me to accomplish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Too many people to protect amongst those I've met in Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>So I will not lose here this day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>(Logi... This is for you, too!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I don't care what kinds of nefarious tricks you have up your sleeve. You will never break this iron will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You must be out of your mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I assure you, she's not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Jubei!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>We'll talk later. Right now, there's work to be done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yes, there is. I can see the fire in your eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>The Scarlet Flame burns bright as ever!</td>
</tr>
