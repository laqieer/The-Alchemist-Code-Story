<td>This range is extremely rugged and mountainous. Do you really think the enemy troops are transferring the Demon through here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>There is said to be an ancient tunnel in this vicinity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You are more likely to discover Philosopher's Stones in places that have a connection to ancient Alchemists. It's possible that the Lizard Brigade may target here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>True...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Even if we don't discover the Demon itself if we find the Lizard Brigade we can have them give up the location of where they are transferring it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Indeed. You seem to be quite invested in all of this, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Not particularly. I want to quickly deal with this Demon mess and quickly embark on searching for Agatha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hm. Right. I promise that we will focus all our efforts on rescuing Agatha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I will not allow you to suffer the same grief you experienced in your past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Lord Gabirond, I want to ask you how you know about my past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmph. As the grand councilor of Envylia, do you think there is anything that I do not know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Then, do you know my blood type?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmph. Type Qe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Correct. What about my likes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Agatha and Logi, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Correct again! Wow... Guess you do know everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Of course. The Internet tells all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The Internet? What other secrets does it hold?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You... Might not want to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>There are some harsh things written about you there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>For example, Headstrong Dias has become a common term, used to refer to those who refuse to listen to others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What?! That's not fair! I have a lot going on in my life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's it! I am going to cut you down where you stand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That right there! That extreme and hasty nature is what gets you criticized online.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Criticized? For what?! I'm cutting you down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Like I said, you're being hasty! You should think before you act!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Think first, then cut?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No! No cutting people down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Think, then stab!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No stabbing either! Your hunger for power is also hurting your popularity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I... I see. How can I get people to like me again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We might have to get the developers to fix this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Do you seek popularity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I want popularity... Popularity to change this sorrowful world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmph. So his conviction remains true, despite having lost his composure after partaking of the mushrooms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If his desire can be sustained, then perhaps...</td>
