<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Well, you know more about fear than I could ever come to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Fear of losing your place in this world, fear of losing at allâ€¦ And the fear of growing so strong, you become numb.</td>

<td>I looked up at an unseen sky, always wanting freedom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>My days were filled with pain, cruelty, and shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Even when they had me lying on my back, all I ever saw was a disgusting ceiling beyond a disgusting man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I closed my eyes, covered my ears, and even denied them the pleasure of hearing me squeal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Being one with you was... Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>That...was the first time I cried tears of joy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Neun! Get out of there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Grraaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Neun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Nng! Ugff! You...bastards...always making us into...outcasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Are we not...e-even allowed to...pursue...the sky we dreamed...of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>S-Sol, please... K-kill these bastards! Set...L-Lost Blue...free! Grrraaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>The last thing I saw was the Sky, turned upside down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I don't see why I can't lie here, staring at it, until I die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>It's the view of the outside; where we walked, together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>We...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Finally, with the ninth escape attempt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>We...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>You should be happy you were strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I guess we were together this whole time, Rat-Killer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>We're outside!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>That's right. We'll be the ones to topple this world's order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>This upside down sky; it's like we flipped the whole world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Man, you really were tough, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Yeah, I'm really strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Hey, Dead Nine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I want to go on a walk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Yeah, just the two of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Well, I guess we're done with all of our nine lives.</td>
