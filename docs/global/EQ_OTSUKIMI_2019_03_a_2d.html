<td>Yaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That settles it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Let's just put these purple dumplings away. They're too dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're so smart, Evelika! How did you know these were the cause?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I wasn't sure about it, but I have heard about the Rainbow Cacao.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Magical engineering is my specialty though, so they're a little outside of my expertise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're very studious, aren't you? Not to mention daring!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Right after quitting school, you started working as a mercenary to earn money while doing research related to magical engineering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It was you who told me that being a mercenary would allow me to get a firsthand look at the most cutting-edge of magical tech.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's true. I did give you the idea. That's why I felt responsible for giving you the test.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I needed to make sure your skill and determination was battle-ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And I take it she passed with flying colors! Amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I-it wasn't a big deal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It was! Caris recognized your talents, so you must've been an amazing mercenary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Heheh, I have an eye for these things! Evelika's a tenacious one, but... Try not to carry too much on your own shoulders, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Caris...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, I'll be off now. Later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Now that I don't have a package to worry about, I can go as fast as I want! Hahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sh-she really is something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah, aren't Phantom Soldiers summoned as they were in their prime? This must've been when she was the fastest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Prime...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Evelika?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah, uh... It's nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Is this how we're supposed to stack the dumplings?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I think it's fine. I mean, it might all come down if we're not careful, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No! Don't say that! Now I have the urge to see how far I can push it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What?! You better not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Aw, okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The silver grass goes here? Like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I think that's probably how it's supposed to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Probably.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm sorry. This was our idea, but you're doing all the work to get everything ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, it's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm just happy that I get to do things with you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Evelika...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Evelika... Can you hear me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wah?! Huh?! Y-yes?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You haven't had a dumpling yet, have you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What? How could I have? I've been too busy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What the... They're mostly gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Wow! I shifted my attention to the silver grass for just a moment, but now we're missing so many!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The dumpling tower I made is ruined... What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Could it have been the kids from Real Heaven? I wouldn't mind if it was them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Theft is theft! They need to learn how to ask, at least! ...Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Evelika? Did you notice something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Those people there... They kept looking this way and when one of them caught eyes with me, they scurried away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That's suspicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It's not right to blindly accuse, but they are acting like they have something to hide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You really are a perceptive one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Kon says the smell of dumplings are coming from the bag they're holding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That's some damning evidence. We worked so hard to put this event together...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>If they were children, that'd be one thing, but they're just simple thieves! How dare they!</td>
