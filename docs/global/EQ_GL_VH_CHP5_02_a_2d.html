<td>Red gently cradles Berith in her arms, as if the greatsword was her only lifeline.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Spent from the violent confrontation in the depths of the underground facility, she only musters a tired stare at the people before her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You're the one they call Red? Nice to meet you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It seems like your wound isn't fatal. I think your friend saved you, there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>He...did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wait. Soren and Blair said she was shot point blank. She shouldn't have been able to deflect it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's true. I saw the bullet pierce her body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, the sword's alive! I think it must have taken some of the damage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's not just a talking object?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This isn't the time for jokes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's not! I have a vague idea what goes on with those weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wait, while you were sleeping inside a cryotube?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I meant that I could sense the Alchemia inside of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>How do I explain it? It's like...they are connected, in a sense?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>When you've got so much Alchemia rattling around, it's not hard to disrupt it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So those weapons are more than just a twisted form of technology... It's almost hard to believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Then again, the shadow that emerged from our assailant's briefcase is definitely more a violent specter than some cleverly concealed artifice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm not even sure what it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Theoretically, anything that can channel Alchemia can be thought of as "living", in a sense...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But as Blair well knows, mechanical objects and tools can process Alchemia, yet do not fall under such a classification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So that begs the question: where do we draw the line?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Could it be that the source of the Alchemia in these weapons are...organic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm not sure if this is related to their experiments, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Emrys pulls a small vial of green liquid from his pouch and proffers it to Minerva.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I slipped this out of a crate they had me retrieve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I observed drug abuse among some of their lackeys. These appear to be psychoactive, but I cannot be certain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Short of a laboratory analysis, I doubt it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>There must be hundreds, if not thousands of doses. The scale of their operations is frankly terrifying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's...my medicine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I...didn't want to take it anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It felt bad, at first...but it feels worse when I take it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>My head...hurts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Are these the doses that Eliza mentioned?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh. So they grabbed some orphans off the streets and made killing machines out of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What else did they make you do? What do you know about the project?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I don't know...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>She's telling the truth. You're scaring her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Goetia killed Roxanne! They have to be taken down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Sieg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I understand your frustration, Siegfried, but terrorizing her won't solve our problems!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Emmy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What is it, Eira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Eira...help scary l-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No... Help Red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You're sure? But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>All right. Let's speak to her. I'll be right behind you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It's you... I remember you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...Scary smell...gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Eira...believe Red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I don't...understand. I... I hurt you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I killed...and killed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Eira shakes her head and holds out a small hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Red...scared...inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Goetia...bad people...make Red bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>They're all I've ever known. That's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I think...I need to clear my head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Where will you go? Goetia will come after you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I can't stay here. You'll...be in trouble too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>And I can't go back, either. So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Thank you, Eira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Thank you for saving me. I know I...don't deserve it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>That's not true. There's a lot we want to ask, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>If it's the drug, you're as much a victim as the rest. It's not your fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Take care, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You've got to be kidding me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Live and let live, Siegfried. Perhaps it is for the best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Later, somewhere in the snowy fields...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What the- Did you see that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Isn't that her? The demon girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Er... We're not equipped for this! Call for backup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Y-you! Stay right there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Have to...keep going...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Berith, wake up, please! I need your help!</td>
