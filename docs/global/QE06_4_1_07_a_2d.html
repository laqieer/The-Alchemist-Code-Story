<td>What is it, Lady Mitsuha? Are you not going to seal away the Demon Paragon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Of course. And this vessel will need to be destroyed, so that it cannot be controlled by the Demon Lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Then why do you hesitate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...?! The horn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We don't know if anything may happen to Mikaboshi and Sumeragi. I want to leave something behind for those who come after us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Where is the martial arts instructor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Here.</td>

<td>Hide this horn. Mark only its location on a map, but do not label what is to be found there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Only its location? But then howâ€”</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I shall spread a legend through the generations of the royal family. One that is not easily deciphered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It will be passed down in hopes that the sacred treasures cannot be used so readily, nor controlled by Malice. Only those who have the wherewithal to unravel the mystery may obtain them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...Though I do pray this horn will never be needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lady Kaede's horn created both Mikaboshi and Sumeragi. What will this horn create?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I don't believe it will be used to create anything new. The aim is merely to protect our land in a time of crisis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I hope Tamba feels the same way. Though perhaps that is nothing more than wishful thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Tamba. We will be taking your horn, for the future of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So it really was true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It shouldn't be possible, but here it is. Another demon's horn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It isn't hard to guess the demon it belonged to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We now have what we need to reforge the Treasure Blade Sumeragi. All that's left is to gain control of the flame from the sacred art Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I have no doubt Amane will come through for us there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Don't you think, Lady Celis?</td>
