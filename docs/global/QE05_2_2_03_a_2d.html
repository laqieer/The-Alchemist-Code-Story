<td>Malta?!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Uh-oh... It looks like you won't be able to hold up much longer. We'd better get you somewhere safe, quick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No, it is not the time for that. The situation here has not yet been settled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Not yet...? What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ahhhhhhh!</td>

<td>Isidore?! Are you okay?!</td>

<td>My body is burning... Sephiron is trying to burn away the darkness inside of me—urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>These are the death throes of Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The resurrection ceremony is a last resort to extend Sephiron's life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Its intent is to spark new life in the aging Sephiron to give her the energy to usher in a new era.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>However, the little energy the resurrection ceremony managed to transfer has been lost with the arrival of Ceclidis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Then what is this light?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You know what it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I... Wait. Yes, it is the Door!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Sephiron is already losing her ability to function as the Door. Unfortunately, that does not mean the Door will remain closed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The power that sleeps beyond it, that which we call Truth, that which carries the will of the world... It now scrabbles to burst forth into our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If that happens, then this country...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. Gluttony would be obliterated in the face of the absolute power of that energy, the source of all Alchemia, which even the Sacred Stones cannot stand against.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmph. It is a cruel irony that a man like Ceclidis, who cannot even sense this power, would be the instigator of our destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Then we must close the Door! "I beseech the supreme—"</td>
