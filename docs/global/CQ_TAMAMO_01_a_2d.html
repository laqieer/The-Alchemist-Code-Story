<td>Yes, yes, I got it. We're almost at the Gyobu tribe's village where the tanukis are, right? It's gonna be fine, so stay quiet, Kon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Kon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes, I got it. You're right, Kon. I'll make sure we don't get any closer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That being said, my intuition says that there's an interesting smell in this direction. Oh! I can see something fluffy growing from that rock!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ouch!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Who stomped on my tail! Argh...what brute force...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ah! That fluffy thing growing on the rock was a tanuki's tail!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No! I was transforming myself into a rock!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yep, yep. Kon was saying that your tail wasn't transformed properly. Are you bad at transforming yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...! That's why I'm training secretly on the outskirts of the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hey, you're from the Gyobu tribe, right? This is close to the human world. Wouldn't you get in trouble for being here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Even amongst my tribe, I'm a special tanuki. I'm allowed to interact with humans! The same could be said for you! You're from the fox tribe, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So you're strong! The Gyobu tribe is big so you must be pretty amazing, huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>U-um...are you Lady...Tamamo, from the Kuzunoha tribe?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ahahah! You don't need to call me Lady♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I've heard that you've already obtained the Nine-Tailed power and you can travel freely between both villages! Everyone is cautious around you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, you can just call me Tamamo! Hey, what's your name? Let's become friends♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm Hayate. I can't become friends with you. I'm in the middle of training. Excuse me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Why are you following me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Because it's fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Please, don't bother my training!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hayate...you're slow on your feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...!!! You're just too fast Lady Tamamo! Please, can you not follow me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh, Kon? What is it...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Please, don't ignore me either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We're surrounded...by monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
