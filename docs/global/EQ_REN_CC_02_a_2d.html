<td>I killed again today.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Killed and killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>And killed and killed and killed.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I killed again today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Everyone is on the march towards death. Eventually we give out, and return to the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I only give those who are moving towards death a little push.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Neither us humans nor the demons are just. There is no such thing as the divine in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There is only the code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>When the threat of demons recedes, humans themselves bring corruption to the land with their evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This causes more demons to appear, and they once again become the danger that Wadatsumi must face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It is like a never-ending game of cat and mouse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The Black Star clan's duty is killing demons, but when they are few we are reviled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We slay demons. Exterminate evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Pain, regret, and grief... Delivered by my own hand every time I killed someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But if we stopped cutting down evil, we would invite the possibility of demon rule over humankind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The first time, I was scared of the blood. The second time, I managed to stop shaking. The third is when I stopped counting. And when I stopped believing in good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Good and evil doesn't matter. All of it cowers in the face of our code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>There is much that is out of our control, that is beyond understanding. Our code. The fleeting nature of life. We drown in it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But protecting the code my family has nurtured for generations with the life I have left is right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But more than anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>A hand, small and only just born, squeezes mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Fragile, but precious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I remember feeling like I would do anything to protect that little hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No matter how illogical our code might be, I accepted it so I could protect the world that my little brother lives in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But not only that. If I can, I want to be the last to carry this burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That is my dream. No matter how unlikely or short-lived it may be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Like bubbles on water...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Aaahh! Wh-why are you doing this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Don't play dumb. We know you have connections with Greed Dike and you're planning something...untoward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Th-that's notâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I hate people like you. It's because of you that Wadatsumi is corrupted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Your actions steer Wadatsumi away from true peace. I find that infuriating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The people of Wadatsumi pray desperately for peace. Do not act like you are not aware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And yet you continue to perpetuate evil. I cannot allow that to happen. After all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I am a Black Star.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You really are fast, Natsume.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Now's not the time to chat. There's still more left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I know that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>All right, let's have a contest and see who can kill more! I'm definitely gonna win!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That's enough, don't you think? Why don't you show yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hmph. You've caught me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Nobody worth knowing, I assure you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The fact that you're here means that you see no problem making deals with Greed Dike. Do I have that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>And what if you do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Then you will be exterminated. As the code demands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I'd like to request you go easy on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Oh, really? Well then, if I make it past three years, I'll let you go!</td>
</tr>
