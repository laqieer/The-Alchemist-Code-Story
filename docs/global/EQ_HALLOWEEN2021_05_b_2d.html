<td>Phew… It's done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Numaaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You did it, Tethys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yup… Went pretty welll…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What I did wasn't that advanced, but I felt an odd sense of accomplishment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Maybe because…we worked together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I see… That's probably it. Thanks for the experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Likewise, thank you. Now, time to get some information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Um, Mr. Ratty, can you understand what I'm saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Numa…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We came here to retrieve the stolen costumes for the parade. Could you tell us why they were stolen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Nma…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Numa, Numaa! Numaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What is it saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So… "Loved Halloween Festival last year. Wanted to join but we are monsters."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I was meaning to ask, but is that how they talk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It seems so, at least that's how I hear it…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Numa! Numaaa…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>"We wear costumes, can blend in" …Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So they wanted to join the parade, but the only way was to disguise themselves. That's why they stole the costumes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That was the reason…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Numa, numa, numaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh? "Everyone having fun. So we also wanted to join."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>"But event sign say monsters scare kids…"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Regardless of their thieving, they weren't being malicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If that was their reason, we should try to help them somehow. Of course stealing is wrong, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We know they weren't out to scare others, for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If we were able to get permission from the city, I'd want them to join.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Alright, let's head back to the city and explain everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If you apologize for stealing, they may forgive you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Numaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We've brought everything back. All that's left now is to return the costumes to the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Glad the Rattys took initiative and helped us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If it were only the two of us, we couldn't have carried all these costumes in one trek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oh! You two are…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh? Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The merchant from the road. I'm glad you guys were able to get here safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Um…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Kyaah! Oh, you're…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm sorry for what happened! It's just…I get scared when I see blood…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But…you were so cool out there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We're sorry that we couldn't thank you earlier. Thank you very much to the both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Mr. Merchant… thank you for your kindness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>All is good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>…! Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Oh, you're back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Looks like you recovered the costumes. Great job!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Welcome back, you two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ramses, Blachett. Um… Did we make it back in time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Of course! Huh? The Rattys are together with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It's about that… They also want to join the parade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The reason they stole the costumes was that they wanted to wear them and blend in with the parade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>They apologize for stealing them, but they're willing to help with the preparations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>We're wondering if they could possibly join us…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Numa! Numaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I see… I'm fine with the idea but how about the city's people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I know they're Rattys, but I may give them a second chance…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If they want to celebrate, then I'm all for it! The costumes are back as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>The Rattys are here because they saw how fun it looks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The kids want to play with the Rattys as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Everyone…! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Then it's settled! Citizens of the city and to the guest Rattys! Let's enjoy this year's Halloween together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Hooray!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The parade was a success.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yeah. Even though we were on guard duty, I still had fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>All the participants were having a great time…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Thank you very much, Tethys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>If it weren't for you, things wouldn't have been this great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>What are you talking about? This is about what you did, Cordelia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>If you didn't say anything to me, I wouldn't have been working with the costume parade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>So…to the both of us then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Heeeey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>There you guys are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Blachett and Ramses? What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>We're here to honor the two people who made this event a success, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Wonderful job retrieving the costumes! A huge success all around for the parade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>We're just glad it ended well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You always play it cool, Tethys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Also, Tethys, this girl said she wanted to meet you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>A girl? Oh, you're…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Um… Miss Tethys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>So… That request from earlier. Is it still valid?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Huh…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>If it's alright with you, can I play with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>…!!! Yeah, sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Hey, Blanchett! I want to play with you and Tethys together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Huh? I…I'm alright with that, but Tethys, are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I thought it might be good to mingle once in a while…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Though no touching…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Hurry, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Okay. Hehe, you remind me of Milis a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Milis? Who's Milis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>A very good friend of mine…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Good for you, Tethys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>The beauty of friendship, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Alright, let's enjoy this Halloween event right up to the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Cordelia, will you help with handing out the rest of the candy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Happy Halloween with new friends!</td>
</tr>
