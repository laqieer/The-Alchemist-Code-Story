<td>Withdrawing information from an android that's no longer active... It's not a concept a human would come up with.</td>

<td>What exactly are Alkaroids?</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Produced by humans and discarded when they're no longer need... Yet, they even speak the same words as us...</td>

<td>When he was still alive, my father told me that if androids keep evolving, they may become the cornerstone of humanity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>As people's hearts became destitute along with industrial advancements, my father was working towards developing something that could be a presence of comfort to humans. This Alkemono is an example of that.</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>He-hey! What are you doing, Alkemono!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't move, aye! Stand still!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Now, their existence has become indispensable. They're great companions, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Their existence is a necessity for us. However...how is it from their perspective?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We make demands of them while they are still useful...and once they're no longer need, we abandon them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Are you talking about a conscious existence within androids?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes. It's just too horrible for them to have been created for the sole purpose of being used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's nothing more than the arrogance of man. If only they could create wonderful memories as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's if the concept of a soul even exists inside of them... Hey, what are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ouch! Owww! Alkemono is messing with my hair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If you tie your hair, Ronnie, you'll look more feminine! A real beauty, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What?! Hey, that's totally unnecessary! I said stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm putting a ribbon on you, aye! That way Edgar will pay more attention to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wh-wh-what are you saying, you idiot?! Quit it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No need to hide it, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...I guess that answers my question. Androids have souls. This one's a perfect example.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>There's a pretty good possibility that the androids created by the Beckrams have souls as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If that's true...then they can be saved as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yep. Come on. Let's go and catch a glimpse of these androids' soul!</td>
