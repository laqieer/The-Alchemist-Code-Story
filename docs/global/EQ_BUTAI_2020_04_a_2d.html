<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Why did you go? Why didn't you tell me anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You disappeared before I had the chance to tell you how happy I was to become Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>And now that we have finally been reunited, you are no longer able to speak...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And I find myself at a loss as to what to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yet you never reply to my letters. The words I receive back have never once been yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>And every reply I get from that dark place is addressed to me in the same way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Correspondence Record (Memories)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>"Dear Mister Blank."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>"The charity of a unknown benefactor can go a long way in these slums."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>"I can tell that your actions aren't driven by lust, or anything as obscene as that."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>"You keep the words coming, even though you're fighting a losing battle. You should know by now that it's futile to stand against the darkness."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>"Be that as it may, I need to know. Tell me about the situation in Lost Blue, about the dark underbelly of this world."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>"What do you need? What would it take for you to accept my sincerity? I will do anything you ask of me. Please, just tell me your thoughts."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>"Do you really think words are all it takes to help people? Do you expect all our troubles to go away just because we share them with you? Pretty sure the world isn't that simple."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>"Words are our means of describing this world, and bringing its truths to light."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>"I need to understand your world in order to save it. Furthermore, I cannot hope to guide people whose feelings I don't understand."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>"Let me get this straight. You think you're capable of understanding everyone who was ever born?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>"Do you think you can achieve world peace by making everybody hold hands and telling them to get along? You think everybody is just going to listen to that, when they've got nothing to gain from it?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>"It's a pretty vision, sure—but that's all it really is, isn't it?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>"I beg to differ. How else do we learn from history, but by discussing it? How can we hope to accept each other, if we do not communicate?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>"Some people may never be able to see eye to eye, this is true; but gaining that understanding is still important, Yuvan. It allows us to see who can peacefully live alongside who."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>"So you'd segregate the population? Must be nice if you get to live on top, but what happens to those of us at the bottom of the barrel?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>"What are you going to do to ensure that people with different backgrounds, cultures, and languages are able to coexist?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>"What will happen when you extend that crisp white glove of yours, and the hand that takes it is covered in filth?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>"You'd turn it away, wouldn't you? And that exchange is just going to leave both parties feeling hurt."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>"Let's imagine that you want to get fish to live on land. For argument's sake, let's say you can understand fishspeak."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>"Heck, let's say that you even know everything there is to know about the ocean. Do you think you could save them all?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>"Do you think you could make those fish thrive on land?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>"What if the fish weren't willing? Would you still try and "save" them?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>"What if they died when you exposed them to all that light of yours?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>"I envy you, you know. You can prance around in the daylight, without ever having to worry about the predators that would pick you dry."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>"Mister Blank."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What a stupid pen pal I've got.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Lost Blue (Memories)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Aren't you taking this a bit too far?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Whatever do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You know exactly what I'm talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>He wants a conversation, right? I'm giving him one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You do realize that this whole thing is pointless?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yeah? So?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Besides, try looking at it from my perspective. It's not all fun and games, y'know. I don't know the first thing about Mister Blank, but I'm talking to him anyway. Now that's generosity!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That's the point of pen pals. You're supposed to get to know one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well, all I know about Mister Blank is that he's some bigshot VIP. Pretty mysterious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hm... I should be on my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Thanks for the delivery!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I don't do things by halves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh. You're pretty dedicated to procedure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Please write your reply soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Let's see... What did he say this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Huh? This is just a blank sheet of paper!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>How am I supposed to reply to this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Sorry to interrupt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Get to the point already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I came all the way out here in person. You understand what this means, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You got some business for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I'm looking for someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hurry up and give me another job. I'm starving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Consider this your final warning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The girl without a voice—she's here, isn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>This is a very simple job. Hand her over, and you'll get your reward. It's as easy as that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Do I look desperate enough to go pawning off people for money? What am I, a beggar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You aren't? I could've sworn you were a resident of Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I've already given you my answer. I've got nothing to say to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>How touching. You're very loyal, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Loyal? Hah. There's no loyalty in Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>In a game of chess on the scale I play, one cannot afford to go without a single pawn. It pains me to see that I am missing a magnificent piece such as yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I'd like you to work for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'd like you to shut up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I'm trying to think of a reply to this blank letter, but I'm not going to get anywhere with all your yapping.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>So quit bothering me already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Tut-tut. You're writing a letter in the middle of our conversation? That's very rude, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I don't wanna keep my pen pal waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Didn't your parents ever teach you that the pen is mightier than the sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I really don't want to have to kill you, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>How's this for a theory?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What if that girl's silence was caused by someone literally silencing her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Like you, for instance. Maybe she found out about some dirty little secret of yours—something that could undermine your crude designs for world peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>That would explain why you're chasing her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>And what secret would this be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Oh, I dunno... our little arrangement?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Some sacrifices are necessary to achieve peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Does the "greater good" ever really serve the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Why, it's serving the people down here, is it not? By sparing them much hunger and suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>If someone else found out about it, would you do the same thing to them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Silence them? Kill them, even?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Such as that pen pal of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Do you hate this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>No? Then stay hidden. Don't pull another stunt like last time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Well, I suppose I can't complain. I got a pen pal out of it. Thanks for that, by the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>This is a place where anyone is welcome. Even people who are marked for death, and people who can barely afford to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>The world needs a place like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>So... Feel like writing a reply in my stead this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>———!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>When you're done with it, you know who to give it to. Tell the delivery girl I said hi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Studying up, are we, Lord Commander?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Not a trace...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>There's nothing! Not a word. I can't find a single mention of Lost Blue anywhere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Northern Pride: Archives (Memories)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I've searched the Grand Library, the archives, everywhere! And yet—nothing. I can't find a thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Isn't that strange? We've both visited it before. We know it exists. So why is it missing from history?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Do people just pretend not to know about it? But why would they do something so cruel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>You're wondering why no one has tried to bring it to light?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>You're a good man, Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Are you making fun of me again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>You know... When you told me that you'd perfect the Holy Guard so that I could resign when it suited me... I was really touched.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I'm afraid I'm hardly any closer to achieving it now than I was back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>You're only mortal. You're overbearing with your subordinates, and stoop to their level when it suits you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>You're fool enough to chase me down alone, and you couldn't compose a decent love letter if your life depended on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Th-that's enough! There's only so much criticism a man can take in one—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>On top of that, you're as dense as wooden board, and an utter fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>But there is no such thing as perfect. You'll never be able to carry the entire world on your shoulders, no matter how hard you try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Kaya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Zain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Am I not good enough for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>What are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I... I mean to say that history's dark recesses may not change, but we could shoulder everything together, if you're willing. Guilt and all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>You'd give up on the light?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Hmhm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Nothing... Nothing at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>A delivery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>A letter? But I haven't sent Yuvan a reply yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I know. I gave him one: a blank piece of paper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>You looked like you were struggling to find the right words, so I took the liberty of helping you out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Go on, take them. These love letters are for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>There are two?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Why—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Bye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Kaya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>I would like to inform you that I am resigning from my position as Captain of the Second Regiment of the Holy Guard. Please consider this letter my formal notice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Not again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Please don't try to get involved with me. Just forget about me instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Why am I so blind to the workings of women's hearts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Why do I always fail to understand the true intentions of those around me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Lord Zain! Lady Kaya just—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>You just got dumped, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>It would seem so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>That's not like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>You look like you've given up already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>You know, I actually really enjoy reading romance novels. Well, okay—I enjoy the part where they help me start conversations with girls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>The point is, I'm kind of an expert on love cliches. And just so you know, the girl always runs away from the guy at the climax of the story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Like, seriously, it happens every single time! I'm pretty tired of reading the same plot over and over again, let me tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>They always use the same lines, too. "You're a fool!" "You're so dense!" "Bye." "Forget about me."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>I-I've been told all of those things!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>So, can you guess what the lovestruck lad always does in this situation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>What to do with a broken heart...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Slothstein: Ruins (Memories)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>It would seem the time has come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>You work fast. I suppose that means this truth I'm investigating is just that inconvenient for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>There is no need for you to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>So you're going to erase me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>If you insist on prying into matters that do not concern you—yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Unfortunately, my curiosity is too powerful a force even for me to tame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>You imply that nothing else is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>More or less.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>You are so conceited as to believe that no one would dare go after you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>I knew that if anyone did intend to come after me, they would likely come prepared... So I made some preparations of my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>The Crimson Dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>This isn't like me at all, but... it can't hurt to unleash one's full strength... on occasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>We got here as fast as we could, but it looks like we're still too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>These are the ones who—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Who crashed your last date too, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Th-that wasn't a date! And nor is this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>They must have it in for romantic trysts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>But this does explain why Kaya handed in her resignation letter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>So then... this was all to put some distance between us, for our own protection? To spare us from getting wrapped up in whatever trouble she uncovered?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Not us, you. She was trying to protect you, Lord Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>You think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Yup. Unlike you, I actually understand women.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>You go chase her. I'll take care of this lot, then catch you up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>But—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Don't worry. I've got a plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>All right... I trust you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Just so we're clear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>It's way too early to conclude this love story. We haven't even got to the happily ever after yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>Don't make me repeat myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>You might have come prepared... but so have I!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Guh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>How are you holding up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>You're late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>Thank you for trusting me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>This lot fight like paladins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>I've been trying to figure out where they come from, though I haven't once been successful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Without your help, Most Reverend Bishop, I fear that this matter will slink back into obscurity again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>I cannot express the depth of my gratitude, that you would risk your own personal safety in order to assist me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>Yes, it is rather kind of me, isn't it? After you stepped down as captain yet again, in spite of my many objections.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>Resigning is easier than all the paperwork this little excursion would've required.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Perhaps I ought to revise some of the Holy Order's bureaucratic red tape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Perhaps I'll even be there to help you. But first, can I count on your help here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>I couldn't disappoint such a pretty face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>Whatever beauty I may possess pales in comparison to yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Oh, please. There's no need to be so humble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>Oh, please. There's no need to flatter me so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>Oh, please—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>Very well. Just this once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>This will be the first and last time, I assure you.</td>
