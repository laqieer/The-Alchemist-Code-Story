<td>What are you willing to wager?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Sorry, but I'm broke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It wasn't until several years after I left the Holy Guard that I was finally reunited with Magnus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>After years of aimless wandering, I found him in an underground gambling den.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Their eyes are ever watchful, and nothing will change the fact that I know what I know. It won't be long before they terminate me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>As long as I keep hanging around in crowded places like this, though, Corpse won't be able to do as they please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So I figured I might as well enjoy life while I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I threw away Alchemy, the Holy Guard, and my family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>For now, I guess I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well...carefree, if anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's not a bad life. Better than being dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>He claims to have never lost a bet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>He was best buddies with Captain Othima back in his Holy Guard days, and they made a lot of money together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>As for me, I was always the one who had to clean up after their messes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A good win in a real life-or-death situation... You can't get this feeling in a bogus game.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's riveting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>As he smirked at me, his right eye winked briefly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I noticed this little tell, something that he did not have back when he dedicated his time to researching Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Mind doing me a favor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It was a little while later that he asked me this, giving me a serious look that I'd never seen on him before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I want you to keep my sister far away from Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Come again? You want me to what, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I was...comforted by that kid, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Didn't know you were into that sort of thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No, you idiot! Not like that! I'm only interested in partners my age or older, but younger than 75.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That so? Here I thought you were picking from the lower-hanging fruit as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ha! And steal your bounty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, maybe my limit is a little younger than 75, but I'm no cradle robber! Anyway, it's the soul that matters, not the age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Well, if you wanna put it so poetically...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Don't worry your pretty pink head. I won't try anything with your little sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Well, that's a relief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So you want me to keep your sister away from Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I might. For the right price. How much are you willing to wager?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh, I don't know... How about my life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What the hell, man?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>She's your sister, isn't she? Why not do it yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I first started learning Alchemy because I wanted to make my little sister smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well, this is rare... You, giving up details about yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I tapped into Alchemia to make a doll move around. You should have seen the smile on her face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Even after our parents split up, I believed that I'd see that smile again someday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That is...until I found out that the peace brought about by Alchemy is false.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And about the Holy Guard's monopolization of Alchemy and their concealment of the truth, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I've heard that my sister is sniffing around about these things, and about Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>She's a clever one. She's bound to attract Corpse's attention eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>They won't take the fact that she and I are related lightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>They'll either try to use her to get to me, or kill her to punish me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Either way, I can't allow her to get involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>So I can't exactly go looking for her myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Did you know there are only three reasons a man will take action?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Let's hear 'em.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>A woman's tears, a child's smile, a love interest, and filial piety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That's four, but whatever. Where do I come into—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You're a man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Are you saying you're not gonna take action because I don't fall under any of those categories?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm a man, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>And men...don't need reasons to help each other out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Dude...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You are the coolest right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I get that a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I like honest people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I never have to doubt what they're saying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Well, I guess I just like people in general.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>As a person myself, I have to interact with other people in order to survive, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Life would be too difficult if I didn't like people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Stifling, even.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You know, meeting you really helped me realize something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>People who like people are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Well... They're lovable, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Information for information, right? That was the condition of the trade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Do you feel like talking now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>About what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>About the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Why do you feel the need to keep this a secret?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What exactly are they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Why do we have to suffer like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I may not know anything worth trading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I once thought I knew everything, but I'm realizing more and more how little I actually know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Alchemy is being used against people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>The tools we carried are now used for killing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>The Cursed Beasts, hidden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>The truth behind our struggles has never been made public knowledge. Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>The corruption of those who uphold justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>For the future of this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>For a future like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Must Alchemy stand in the way of seeing my family again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Mira, I won't pretend to know what it is that's weighing on your shoulders...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>But maybe it's time you let some of that weight go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Thanks for your concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Still, there are some things that I've gotta find out...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Challenges I have to pursue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>That's why I'm here, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Why not just let the flow of this river take you where it will?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Easy for you to say. You don't know anything about this river!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>That's because you won't tell me anything about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I did so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Would it help you to know...? I believe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Eeeeek! What are you doing, you creep?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Huh. So I really can't touch you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>It might seem like nothing special to you, but I still feel it when people go through me and it's really weird!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Seriously?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Wha—?! No! Stop that! Eeeeeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Hahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>It's not funny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>So you came here—all the way from the past—in search of the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Yeah! What about it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Yet you can't interact with anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Well... Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Then I guess you'll just have to watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Watch...what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Nothing ever goes as planned, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>In this crazy thing called life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I can't interact with everything, either. There are things that I can't let myself get too close to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>We'll just have to let the river take us where it will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>If we have to sit back and watch, we may as well do it with smiles and laughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>She got away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Who got away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Your little sister's just as hardheaded as you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Still, I did warn her to stay away from Alchemy and that ancient ruin in Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Meanwhile, I've got Corpse preoccupied with this stone I snatched from under their noses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I've done what I can, so now all there is for me to do is find out how much danger I'm in myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Stop that. It doesn't suit you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Well, I guess it's my turn now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I have my own way of doing things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Just you watch. I won't miss the mark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>This is a first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>For what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>This is the first time I'm praying your wager goes down the drain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Then you're staking your hopes against a winning hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>(He's laughing.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>(How can he be laughing?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Wh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>...</td>
