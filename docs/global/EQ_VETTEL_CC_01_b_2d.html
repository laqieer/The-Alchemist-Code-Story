<td>Why would you do something like this? Why rob your fellow countrym—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Why?! Isn't that obvious? There's no other way to survive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This war has left us with nothing! No home, no family! Nothing! Everything is gone! We don't have any other choice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...I see. You were also victims of this war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The fact that I couldn't stop this world from forcing you into a life of crime is my sin to bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...But that doesn't mean I can overlook it when you inflict harm upon others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Gh... Curses...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It is the duty of Scarlet Flame Guard to watch over the citizens of Envylia, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Captain Vettel! We apologize for our delay! Are you unharmed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm all right, though I can't say the same for these folks. Please look after them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Of course they must be punished for their crimes, but they are still citizens of Envylia even if they had to turn to a life of crime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>They had no other way to survive, huh? This country is still a long way away from recovery...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>U-um, C-Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>My apologies, I was lost in thought—are you injured?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm safe and sound. Thank you so much for helping me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's a relief. Huh? Why are you crying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sniff... B-because you got injured on my behalf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh? This little thing? Don't worry about it. I barely noticed it. I'm just happy you're safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Truly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Truly. If anything, your tears make my heart ache more than this wound ever could. So chin up and give me your best smile!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Okay... I will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Much better. That's what I like to see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What do you mean much better?! You big idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>O-ouch! Natalie! H-hold on a sec—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No, you listen up! One wrong move and you could've been seriously injured!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No matter how many people you were facing, the fact that mere bandits could injure you at all is proof that you're too tired to be doing this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Haha... I can't hide anything from you. I guess I'm a little tired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...I'll give you some medicine to help with the fatigue, but could you try not to worry me into an early grave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Seriously... This is exactly why I've been saying that you should let other knights take care of your patrols for a bit. You need some rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I know I do, but going on patrol meant that I could take care of these bandits. So it's not like nothing good came out of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If that's what it takes to keep the city safe, then a little bit of exhaustion is nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If anything, going outside and seeing the people I do this for gives me strength. Knowing that I could keep them safe is better than any medicine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...At least take one of the other guards with you then. You shouldn't keep trying to do this alone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Are you still hung up on the time Nina collapsed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Right, that time she overdid it after you appointed her as Vice-Captain... But that's a different story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...No, I should've known Nina would overwork herself. That's just the way she is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Vettel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hello everyone! I'm back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Vettel?! Are you okay? I heard you got injured!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Haha, word spreads quickly around here! This is getting embarrassing... It's just a couple of scratches, so don't worry about it. You have a message for me, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ah! Yes, I do! My apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I would like to give you my report on the Crown's Guard's cooperation with the Blue Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We successfully ensured that the king's coronation went off without a hitch. As did all related ceremonies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That's right. I heard even the king praised the Crown's Guard efforts. Excellent work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Th-thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What about your team, Nina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>We're successfully cooperating with the others to lead Envylia down the road of recovery!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I haven't been Vice-Captain for too long, and I face some troubles being in this position as a therian...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>But Victor has been super helpful in getting everyone to fall in line!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh? Sounds like you were a big help, Victor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It's no big deal! We're all just doing our best to rebuild this country!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Everyone is working so hard. Even Ren is traveling all over this continent to keep an ear on the ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I heard. I actually got a letter from him the other day. He should be coming home soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It does me good to see how hard everyone is working. As your captain, I couldn't be prouder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Chloe? Is everything okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Y-yes! Couldn't be better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Are you sure? You're looking a little pale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Hn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>That goes for you too, Nina. You're a hard worker, but I don't want you to overdo it either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Victor, too. Don't be reckless just because you're confident in your abilities. If something happens it'll be too late...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What? Why are you all looking at me like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...Look who's talking. You're the last person they want to hear that from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...Ah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Excuse me, Captain! A fight broke out near the Wratharis border! The men in the area are not equipped to handle this alone. We need to send reinforcements!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Understood. I'll go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Vettel, come on! We just talked about this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Don't worry, I can handle this much. Besides, I just wrapped up my patrol. I have the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>The rest of you should head back to base and take some time to rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...Uh-uhm, Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Never mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>We'll see you later. Be careful out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Thanks, Victor. Well then, I'm just going to check in on the situation. Vice-Captain, I'll be leaving you in charge while I'm gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Sigh... Every time with this guy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>...Leaving us all to worry out here.</td>
</tr>
