<td>None of you are strong enough to face me! Are you certain that you wish to continue this battle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Tch! Don't falter now! Attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I would have spared you if you had turned back. Now, it is too late for you all. I accept your challenge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(Such a waste...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Father?! Father! Hold on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>To think that this day, which I have looked forward to for so long...in which I could finally stand on the battlefield with you... To think that I would make such a careless mistake...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Do not weep, daughter. The battlefield is a place for death. Still, we must fight to protect that which means most to us. I leave Envylia...to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Father! Please don't die! Father!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(I should loathe the battlefield after losing my father upon it, and yet...I crave battle.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(Cutting down my enemies one by one with my lance in hand makes my blood burn and my heart flutter.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(I feel...ascendant!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(Perhaps it is only fitting that these contradicting feelings should do battle in my heart...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This was...unsatisfying. It is time to move on. There will be other opponents for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's the Ruinmaker! She's coming to back us up! Once she's here, we'll have this in the bag!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Envylia will not be able to hold up under the strength of her axe! Once she's here, victory will be in sight! We wait for our chance, and then turn the tide of this battle right back into our favor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Let's end this already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ruinmaker... So she, too, is a woman...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Everyone! Be on your guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaarghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Foolishness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So this is the Ruinmaker! Such power...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Nnrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Miss Priscilla!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Stay back! I will hold the line here. Your orders are to reform the lines while holding back the other soldiers from Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If our forces fall here, this battle will be all but lost! Hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Roger! Please, be careful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Intriguing. Not only did you stop my axe, but you are still able to stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I am Theresa, the Ruinmaker. May I have your name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I am Priscilla, a lance instructor from Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Prepare yourself, Ruinmaker! I will cut you down where you stand!</td>
