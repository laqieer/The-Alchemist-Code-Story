<td>Day of Strategy Implementation<br><br>Midnight<br>Inside Forest of Wadatsumi</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm sure about now Lord Zain and Kagura are taking a small group of soldiers and heading to the rendezvous point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That's quite the dangerous mission, even for the Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We need to quickly get out of this forest and meet up with them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I am aware of that, Captain Yauras! But can I speak with you for a moment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>My subordinate? Or should I say comrade? Her name is Suzuka and she wants to talk with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm Suzuka. I would like to offer a word of advice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If you would like to reach the rendezvous point as soon as possible, then there's a shortcut up ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If you would leave it to me, I will guide you there. Please take it into consideration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmm. I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Suzuka is originally from Wadatsumi and she knows this area well. I think you can trust her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What proof do you have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Even if she's from Wadatsumi and your subordinate, she's not a Paladin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>She may be connected with the enemy. She could be telling us the wrong path in order to isolate us and have us ambushed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>For starters, the way she became your subordinate was way too suspicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>She appeared in front of Lord Zain when he was working and challenged him to a fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Why did you make that person your subordinate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I-it's true...if you think of it logically...it's really suspicious, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Mistress?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But I know this! Suzuka's eyes show no sign of deceit. She wouldn't lie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You trust people too easily. Try to learn to be more cautious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What do you mean...no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm not very smart and I make lots of mistakes, causing those around me lots of problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But...I am confident that I have an eye for people. I know for a fact that Suzuka is not a bad person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It can't be helped that you don't trust Suzuka because she isn't an official Paladin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Instead, trust me! For trusting in Suzuka!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Kanon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Mistress...ohh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hey, what are you crying about Suzuka?! Also, stop calling me mistress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>But...sob...I can't believe that you would defend someone with an unknown past like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I, Suzuka, will dedicate my life to doing my best! Even if I am the last troop, I will protect you, mistress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You don't have to! I told you, just during this one operation, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Jeez. Seriously. Once she starts saying it, you can't stop her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Fine...Kanon and Suzuka. I will trust you. Show me this shortcut of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Captain Yauras! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I, Suzuka, will give it everything that I can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh! Can I ask another question?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What is it this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's about Captain Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I know that our mission is in Wadatsumi and it is to follow after Kagura and Lord Zain after they enter a certain cave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>However, it caught my interest that, amongst the captains gathered, Captain Kudan's name alone wasn't listed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Is he on some other mission? Or did they just forget to call him? We've just  left the port so maybe we can leave him a message.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Are you at it again? I don't have time to explain now, so I'm gonna have you be quiet for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huh? He-hey...stop!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hey! What do you think you're doing picking up my mistress like that?! You're so rude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Look, just shut up and keep walking!</td>
</tr>
