<td>All right. We finished them off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We've still got a long way to go. Keep your guard up as we advance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yep, got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hey, Kagura...about what we just discussed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What about it? Look, I trusted you enough to tell you. Don't go blabbering off your mouth, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I won't... I'm going to support you, Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I know this might sound imprudent, but I was glad that you told me about your tragic past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Th-that wasn't why I told—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Besides, my goal is the same as yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I want to become a strong knight who can stand against any villain. I want to save as many people as I can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So Kagura...let's do our best together! If the two of us fight side by side, I'm sure we can become much, much stronger than we are now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>H-hmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I thought you were just an airhead, but you do have some redeeming qualities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Of course I do! Come on, let's shake on it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It'll be our way of apologizing to each other and agreeing to do our best in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>H-huh?! But...</td>

<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Come on, let's do it!</td>

<td>How long are you two gonna play at being buddies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We're not friends. We're nothing more than allies, working together to complete our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Unfiltered emotions have no place on the battlefield. It will only hasten your death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But then—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Do you want to contradict me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No, but then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What do you think is required on the battlefield, Captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Are you saying that the only thing needed is one's body and weapon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No, I'm not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What you need is power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Overwhelming power to suppress evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...</td>
