<td>Are you gonna make your awesome meat pie?! Yes!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hisham</td>
<td>What kind of merchant would come this far into the desert, only to leave money on the table like that?! Of course he's got spices!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>

<td>Traveling Merchant</td>
<td>Yes, there was no one else with us, sir. What exactly is this about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gluttony Military Official (North)</td>
<td>That is none of your concern. Now, you do have a valid permit to do business in our country, do you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traveling Merchant</td>
<td>Of course! We would never get involved in any backdoor dealings of any kind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gluttony Military Official (North)</td>
<td>Good. Now, have you sold anything in this area?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traveling Merchant</td>
<td>What? In this area? Um... There was a guy this morning that seemed like a local of some sort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gluttony Military Official (North)</td>
<td>Would you say he was a traveler? Wearing relatively light clothing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traveling Merchant</td>
<td>Hmmm. I would say it wasn't really the type of protective clothing one would wear if they were traveling across the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traveling Merchant</td>
<td>Wouldn't you know better than I, though? There must be one or two villages in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gluttony Military Official (North)</td>
<td>Thank you very much for the information. Now, I recommend you get a move on. Our troops will more than likely come through this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traveling Merchant</td>
<td>I-I see. We shall do as you say, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Is the army looking for our village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>

<tr>
<td>Traveling Merchant</td>
<td>What? N-no, that couldn't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traveling Merchant</td>
<td>Eh? Sir, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gluttony Military Official (North)</td>
<td>It might be the man the General spoke of! Do whatever it takes to get your hands on him! Just make sure he can still speak in the end!</td>
