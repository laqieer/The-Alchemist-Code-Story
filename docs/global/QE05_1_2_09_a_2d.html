<td>Kamui! You're back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Indeed, he is! A little late though, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Malta? I didn't realize you would be visiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well, I wanted to check in with Hisham. He's gotten much better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, really? It was me you wanted to check on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Why, you! Hisham! What are you flapping your mouth about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Did something happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>N-no, nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Did you hear? Isidore said this morning that there's a supply caravan nearby.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ah. I remember him saying something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh! That's how he got this candy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh, he already did some trading with them? I was hoping to get some good frankincense from them if I could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I feel a little bad asking him to go out again for it, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'll go take a look myself later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You...? I will go in your stead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh? You just got back, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's a good opportunity for me. I just realized I haven't gotten you a wedding present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This is the perfect time to display my loyalty to the next leaders of our village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I see. Well, in that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>By the way, Isidore said that the caravan is in the tent across from the rock wall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then I shall go see. It's a good chance to replenish our food stocks, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wait, does that mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Are you gonna make your awesome meat pie?! Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If the merchant has any good spices I can trade for, perhaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What kind of merchant would come this far into the desert, only to leave money on the table like that?! Of course he's got spices!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well, you never know. It's probably fine, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Come back soon! I'm looking forward to seeing what you get your hands on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Be careful out there, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hm... It does look like the supply caravan was here before, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Is this everyone in your caravan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Uh oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes, there was no one else with us, sir. What exactly is this about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That is none of your concern. Now, you do have a valid permit to do business in our country, do you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Of course! We would never get involved in any backdoor dealings of any kind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Good. Now, have you sold anything in this area?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What? In this area? Um... There was a guy this morning that seemed like a local of some sort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Would you say he was a traveler? Wearing relatively light clothing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hmmm. I would say it wasn't really the type of protective clothing one would wear if they were traveling across the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Wouldn't you know better than I, though? There must be one or two villages in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Thank you very much for the information. Now, I recommend you get a move on. Our troops will more than likely come through this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I-I see. We shall do as you say, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Is the army looking for our village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Could there be something wrong with Narol?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That noise... Liars! You are hiding someone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What? N-no, that couldn't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Eh? Sir, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It might be the man the General spoke of! Do whatever it takes to get your hands on him! Just make sure he can still speak in the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Roger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What are they thinking?! Are they really so desperate to catch one man?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If I cannot shake them off... Then I cannot return to the village!</td>
</tr>
