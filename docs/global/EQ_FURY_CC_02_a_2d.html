<td>001</td>
<td>They were unforgettable stories; beloved tales from childhood. The adventures of just knights and princesses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>In a land across the sea, a knight brandishes their sword and swears their love to the princess. They protect her with all the fierceness of a lioness defending her cubs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm not afraid of death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We were children, playing children's games. There are some words that can only be said when you're playing pretend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I want to be a knight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I swear my love and loyalty to you, princess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Playing the role of princess is...kind of embarrassing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Aw, c'mon. Play along, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're my master and I'm your servant. You should act a little more selfish and haughty with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I refuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We're family, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Family?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wouldn't that make things more peaceful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Y'know, I hate traveling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Urk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I can't take baths as often as I'd like...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Urk... Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And sometimes I get stuck with a seasick roommate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Nngh... Blrpk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's okay. The sea will catch whatever you throw at her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm not going to vomit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh, look. A giant wave's coming this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>A Paladin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yup. A knight of the Holy Guard. We stand for the absolute justice of the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Then you really did become a knight like you said you would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey, how's that old handicrafts lady doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Still losing her hair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Guess that proves that hair growth serums are always a sham, no matter where you buy it, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>She asked me to bring her back something from a country other than Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>How about I get you some seasickness medicine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'd appreciate that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wadatsumi is still restricting its relations with other countries, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's because it was in turmoil for a very long time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And now that the house of Rising Ashes has the throne, everything's back to normal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The taverns are full of soldiers drinking through the night without a care for rank.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ahh, now I get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Get what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You're used to just reacting to the things that come up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes, well... Not everything is solved by letting the sea swallow it up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>So that's how you ended up getting your chance to set out and explore the world, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ikasa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Why did you leave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You just left. Without telling me anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Button...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I was all alone for so many years, and now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But I came back, didn't I? I'm right here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Geez...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You're a demon, aren't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I hate this place! Onigashima is riddled with these fiends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Lady Leafah, please! Calm yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>No, I will not! As the warrior poised to become the next general, I cannot let this stand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I knew I was right to keep watch! I knew that eventually someone would come along who wasn't a traveling merchant, someone from the land of demons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That's right! I've been watching for any demon fool enough to attempt an invasion of the proud nation of Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>That is my duty as the future general of this nation! I must remain vigilant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Did she say...the land of demons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>She's talking about Wadatsumi. Since it's been restricting its relations with other nations, there have been a lot of nasty rumors going around about what's going on there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You would be wise not to underestimate me, for I am...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>The future general of this nation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Exactly! I like the way you think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>But protecting a demon is unforgivable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Lady Leafah, please! These people areâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I know what they are! Foul demons who threaten the peace of the continent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>They see us as...demons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Some people just won't listen, no matter what you tell them. You'll find a lot of her kind out here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ikasa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That's why I went home, y'know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Prepare yourself, demon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Lady, you've got no chill.</td>
