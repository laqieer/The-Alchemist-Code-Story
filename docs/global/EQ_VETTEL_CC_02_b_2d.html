<td>This place is more dangerous than we thought. I better let the Holy Guard know...</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>Huh? Captain Vettel! You're back already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yeah. Reporting to the Holy Order went faster than expected. What are you doing here?</td>

<td>005</td>
<td>Uhm, well, I just figured that the ruins were kinda suspect. If something were to happen here, the village would be in danger.</td>

<td>So after I finished my duties in town, I rushed here to keep an eye on things. I know I shouldn't decide these things on my own, but I figured better safe than sorry, right?</td>

<td>Nina wanted to come too, but I sent her home since I figured I'd just check in real quick... That girl's barely had a chance to breathe lately. She needs the rest.</td>

<td>So you also came to take a look then... You've really grown, Victor. To think that you've become someone able to see beyond yourself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Forget about that, though! What are you doing here?! Leave this place to me and go back and rest already! Especially when you're dressed like that!</td>

<td>Natalie's gonna give you a real scolding if you get that outfit dirty!</td>

<td>A scolding? Come on, I'm not a child...</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Uh, Vettel? What was it that I said again? Come straight home? No distractions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>...</td>

<tr>

<td>I can't believe you got your brand new uniform dirty already! At least put on a fresh change of clothes before you come back, you idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>S-sorry...</td>
