<td>Well, you appear to have analyzed yourself quite adequately. That's why, right now, you are nothing more than a "sword."</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sets.png" alt="Setsuna" height="128"><br>Setsuna</td>

<td>Yes. I fight to protect Wratharis—to protect my friends.</td>
</tr>

<td>Well, I did encounter an idiot who helped me realize these things that I'd forgotten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sets.png" alt="Setsuna" height="128"><br>Setsuna</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blossom</td>
<td>You should be; that sword of yours is utterly devastating. Really though, this was all the thief's fault. You don't have to blame yourself for any of it, Setsuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sets.png" alt="Setsuna" height="128"><br>Setsuna</td>
<td>It's not that simple. The sins from my past that I carry with me are not something I can easily brush aside.</td>

<td>In that case, as a way of atoning for your past sins, I would gladly accept your sword in service to Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
