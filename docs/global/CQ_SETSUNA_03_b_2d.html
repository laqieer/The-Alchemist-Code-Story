<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Re-reporting! Mission accomplished!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>?! Why do you sheath your sword?! The fight is still not...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Your fight has already ended, traveler...or should I say, Mercenary Setsuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...Why do you know my name?! And what do you mean by my fight has already ended?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...?! Blossom! Will you use the innocent as a shield?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Innocent...huh? You've nowhere to run; you might as well tell her the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Tsk! He-heh. Sorry about that, lady. I took advantage of you...although, as you can see, it's ended in failure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This man belongs to the band of thieves who attacked the oasis. You were deceived and taken advantage of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>No... A-are you saying that I was using my sword to defend evil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Seize that woman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wait! There's no need for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>She is a sword...an innocent sword. The one who used her to serve his purpose is the only one who should be punished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wouldn't you agree with me, Setsuna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I don't...really understand. How do you know my name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Did you think that the name of a Blademaster such as yourself was not known throughout the land?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You overestimate me. I'm nothing more than a mercenary who not only failed to protect the one she loved but abandoned any attempt at revenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, you appear to have analyzed yourself quite adequately. That's why, right now, you are nothing more than a "sword."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I mean that there is a worthy place for a sword like you to be wielded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>A worthy...place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes, a worthy place: a battle fought to protect something, for example.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>A battle fought to protect something... I see... Blossom, that's why your sword is so powerful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes. I fight to protect Wratharis—to protect my friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Then I stand no chance against you. Those are the things I discarded long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, I did encounter an idiot who helped me realize these things that I'd forgotten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Look at me; my long years of wandering alone have made me forget the most fundamental aspects of being a swordsman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...The inner eye to discern what is one's justice and the strength to pursue that path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...I guess you're leaving now, Setsuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm sorry for having caused you trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You should be; that sword of yours is utterly devastating. Really though, this was all the thief's fault. You don't have to blame yourself for any of it, Setsuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's not that simple. The sins from my past that I carry with me are not something I can easily brush aside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>In that case, as a way of atoning for your past sins, I would gladly accept your sword in service to Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I can't do that either. I need to figure out what justice means for me personally. Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...Besides?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Blossom, I've made it a point to travel alone until now. That's why, if I stay with you any longer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We'll end up becoming good friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...Anastasia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...A-Ana...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Anastasia. That's my real name—the name of a friend, Setsuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's time for you to bid farewell to Blossom. One day, when your fight is over, come and visit your friend Anastasia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...All right. I'll do my best. Let's meet again...Anastasia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I wonder how long it's been since I've looked at the sea this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I won't run from my own battle, Anastasia, I'll fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>This power...must not be misused.</td>
</tr>
