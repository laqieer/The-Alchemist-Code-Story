<td>You saw it, didn't you? The Discarnate Power multiplying… Demons cannot learn such skills by themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>They must have joined forces with Greed Dike to gain new power. That's the most logical explanation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That would coincide with what you saw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This ties it all together… It seems the roots go deeper than we thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>... It's hard to imagine, but the demons may have been connected to Greed Dike since waaaaay back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...Celis may be in danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Celis...? Why would she--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>She went to Greed Dike alone while you were kidnapped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Why would she go alone!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>She went to investigate possible connections to the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Where else? To find Celis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…We can't allow it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Why not!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We haven't verified Greed Dike's involvement yet... Do you really want to go stir up trouble before we know for certain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>…But!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>All we can do now is wait… We're all as anxious as you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>…Let's have faith in Celis. That's all we can do for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>…Alright.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, he's away? I see. My apologies for the sudden visit... Yes. Perhaps, I'll see him the next time I give my report… Thank you for your time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Where could he have gone…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>…It can't be…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Fancy meeting you here...Celis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Why are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm conducting an inspection as ambassador to Wadatsumi. I thought it best to monitor the demons' movements directly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Haven't you been receiving my periodic reports? Were they not enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>First hand knowledge is necessary from time to time… Are you suggesting anything untoward?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>…No, not at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I must say, I’m disappointed to see the leader of the Blade Fox Corps standing here chatting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>…You're surrounded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>…!</td>
