<td>004</td>
<td>You've been doing this for as long as I can remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It is a necessary evil. One I am willing to undertake for you.</td>

<td>It's only fair that they would eventually keep their derision in check.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, I've lived through years of their passive aggression just fine. Let them grumble.</td>
</tr>
