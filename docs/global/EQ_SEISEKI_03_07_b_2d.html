<td>We've taken care of the monsters. Do you mind explaining to us what's going on, Dr. Alexis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Explain what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Don't play dumb! You tried to make the monsters launch a surprise attack on us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>A surprise attack? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's inefficient to feign innocence any longer. On whose orders are you acting on? Tell us and we'll let you live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hold on! There's been a misunderstanding! Dr. Alexis isn't our enemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Don't be so over-dramatic. I just did what any doctor would do...cough...cough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Dr. Alexis! That wound... You're bleeding so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Please, lower your voice. My medicine will be able to heal this right away...cough...cough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Bu-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm so sorry. I totally thought you were the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I thought you were pretending to go drink your medicine while actually eavesdropping, waiting for us to lower our guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You completely misunderstood my intentions. Well, I was eavesdropping.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hey now, don't get worked up. I was just curious to know what was going on in those ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I had no doubt that something had happened. After all, there were many wounded as a result.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wounded?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, now that I look at you carefully, aren't you from the same tribe as them? You've got very similar eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hold on...when you say many were wounded, are you referring to the Alize people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. I remember them calling themselves something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>When I went to find the necessary herbs and mushrooms for my research, I happened upon them by chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>To be truthful, I would have preferred not to get involved, but they all seemed on the brink of death...so my instinct as a doctor kicked in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Did you help them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>And...where are the wounded now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I renovated the underground cemetery into an inpatient facility. They're resting there now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>They're getting in the way of my research, so I'd like them to leave soon, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It'll be troublesome if I rush them out and they end up back here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Are you...serious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I heard that Waginau had killed everyone from the Alize people. Are you telling me that they're still alive? Seida!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes! Oh...I'm so relieved!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm so happy for you, teacher! Do you want to go and check on them real quick?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No...we head out immediately. It's enough to know that they're all right. We must prioritize the mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You're right. Thank you, Dr. Alexis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Your movements were really suspicious, but you're actually a super nice person! Thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>No need to thank me. After all, I just did my duty as a doctor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>More importantly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It seems like you are all caught up in some kind conflict. Do be careful while you travel. Cough...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We will be! You be careful as well, Alexis!</td>
