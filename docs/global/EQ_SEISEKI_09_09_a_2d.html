<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Just as I thought. The Greed Dike soldiers have infiltrated Saga after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes, but judging from their size, I'm guessing they're scouts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>In any case, at some point they'll most likely engage in conflict!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What terrible people! I remember when they destroyed Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Surely they're not planning on doing the same thing they did to Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Kagura, I'm sure you heard about the terrible things they did to the people of Wadatsumi, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, yeah...after all, I was there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You were there? Then all the more so! It must hurt your head just to remember...huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Sorry, you might not have heard, but...I'm actually from Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?! No, but...wait, hold on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Weren't you related to the royal lineage of some country, Kagura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh?! But...does that mean...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes...it does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Y-you're Wadatsumi royalty?! Oh...! Sorry...I had no idea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No, it's okay. I'm just glad to hear that you have Wadatsumi in your thoughts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes, but...I got really upset, you know?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Right now they've pretty much become a territory of Greed Dike, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It still doesn't change the fact that they destroyed Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>On top of that, they've never apologized for any of it. How villainous can they be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But...it can't be helped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>In Wadatsumi we used something we called "Chakras" every day without realizing that it was a classification of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>When it was discovered that it was in conflict with the Magna Code treaty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It ultimately put Greed Dike, who had rule over Wadatsumi, in the right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But...the people of Wadatsumi didn't do it with malice though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>They didn't use it for military purposes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Of course not! We just used it in our everyday life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Nobody even thought of using Chakras for military purposes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Right?! I mean, no matter how you look at it, it was obviously an invasion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's completely unfair that Greed Dike's actions are justified. Doesn't everyone in Saga say that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm sure somebody got some kind of bribe from Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It must've been Waginau...I'm sure of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>N-no...in any case, there's no point in going over it again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That's not true! I mean...this time they're trying to do the same thing with Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>For starters...why did they even need to destroy Wadatsumi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's true that Wadatsumi had undergone their own development and were creating strange weapons and arts which must've been attractive to them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But...if it was for territory expansion or to take the rights for those crafts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Why would they go out of their way to actually kill the people?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Like you said...at first people whispered that those were the reasons behind their motives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>However...recently, I came to understand that they had a different motive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Are you talking about the Mikaboshi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh? Why do you know about it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>My teacher told me a few things when I joined her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It surprised me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Commander Zain had heard about the discovery of the Mikaboshi and, in an attempt to prevent exploitation of it, he was killed, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The Wadatsumi royal family had something called the Kagutsuchi. It was to be used in case the hidden Mikaboshi was discovered and abused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It was a secret weapon that had the ability to destroy the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You mean it could actually destroy it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>For Greed Dike, who was after the Mikaboshi, this thing was considered a threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That's why they tried to end the Wadatsumi royal bloodline.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm sorry, I don't know what to say, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. It's all in the past. You can say whatever you want about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Okay. Well, if they saw it as a threat...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Then why didn't they just sever the royal bloodline?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Why did they have to go out of their way to completely devastate all of Wadatsumi...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'm sorry...I'm speaking without fully knowing the situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But, you know...it seems weird that, just because they couldn't obtain the Mikaboshi, they would go out of their way to destroy the entire country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What are you saying? That's exactly what they did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But maybe...there was another reason for why they did that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>No... Let's not get into it since it's just speculation. I shouldn't have brought it up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Captain Othima said the exact same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That they obliterated the country in order to destroy the truth of their invasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I don't really want to reflect too much on that time, but I decided to think of it that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>That being said...do you think there was another reason why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>At the time, Commander Zain was alive and well; the world in general was more balanced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>In other words, in a state absent of any real conflict, why would Orion act in that way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>It wasn't as if the Mikaboshi was going to escape somewhere. Yet, he invaded with outrageous force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...?! Watch out!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Aghh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>?! ...Almira!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>So you're with someone who can read the wind, huh? I was hoping to carve you up with my beautiful blades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ack! Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I am one of the Veda Templars...Sieba, the Twin Blade. You're Captain Kagura of the 5th Regiment, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Veda Templars...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Unfortunately, you're not Yauras, but I guess you'll do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>?! She disappeared?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Let's just call this fight a prelude to my fight with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Behind...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Bloom into a beautiful flower and explode into scattering petals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Agh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Ugh...! Y-you wield a twin blade like Yauras!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>No, you're wrong. Yauras has a twin blade like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Wh-who cares what the order is?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>The fact that the Templars are here must mean that Greed Dike has gotten their hands on some information!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Are you talking about Matter? Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>If it wasn't so...I would never come all the way to this dull countryside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Ack! You're not getting away! Not you of all people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, you've tried to blow up the Mikaboshi before, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Matter is our reward. I won't let you lay a finger on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>H-how...?! Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Aren't you a little slow to realize that you've been slashed? This is pointless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>H-how can she move so fast?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Is that it, Paladin? At this rate you're even worse than Yauras...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Kagutsuchi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>You've wrapped her in phoenix wings! You can do this, Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>If I were still there at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Agh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>You're too slow with your moves. You won't be able to catch me at that rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>What the...?! Even Kagura's art can't catch her....?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Hehe. Don't worry. Rest assured I'll finish you with one blow so that you don't suffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>...Ugh! Yo...you gotta be kidding me! I'm not gonna lose to a fake like you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>...! What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I-if I lost to a fake like you...I wouldn't hear the end of it from Yauras! Ugh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Fake... What exactly are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I...I've seen Yauras right up close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Her agility and technique with the sword, her gracefulness...you're nothing compared to her! You're a fake in all things, and I won't lose to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Did you call me a fake? Are you saying I'm an imitation, you little...!!!</td>
</tr>
