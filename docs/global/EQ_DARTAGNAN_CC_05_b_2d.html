<td>Haaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Too slow. I'm a therian, remember? Hyaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Aghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>D'Artagnan, watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...? There's nothing there... Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Courage?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Phew... That was a close one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Indeed. As skilled as always, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You...saved us? Why are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I am the mercenary Courage. I've been hired to rescue the therians that have been taken. With me is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Inquisitor Cheryl of the Holy Order of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>These people are under suspicion for the use of illegal Alchemy. They were persons of interest previously in my investigation as an inquisitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Unfortunately, they fled before we could complete our investigation, hiding in these ruins and putting up a barrier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Just when we were wondering what our next step should be, we heard that Envylian Knights would be breaching the barrier. We thought we'd come along for the ride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We were quite surprised by your strength, but it made things easy for us. Thank you for your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You should thank D'Artagnan! She was the one who borrowed the cannon and broke through the barrier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh?! But it's thanks to you that we found this place! You should get the credit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But I think that you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see. It seems this mission succeeded thanks to you both taking advantage of your individual talents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I've come to expect nothing less from the knights of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'm glad you've found a way to use your strength for good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Whoa, what's wrong, Yura? Your tail is going crazy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The captured therians have been released. The ruins have been sealed and the extremist members have been apprehended without issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>All research relating to the Shadow Messiah has been confiscated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We will now continue our investigation into the Lustburg research and search for any remnants of the group while cooperating with the Envylian knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Understood. I expect things to go smoothly thanks to our friendly relationship with Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This puts to rest a thorn that has been in our side for years. We have the knights of Envylia to thank for finally driving them out into the open.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That D'Artagnan... She's quite something. I suppose I should've expected as much from the Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>She was not acting alone. The Envylians have many superb knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Philosopher's Stones... Demons... Sounds like we're going to have our hands full.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Sticking their necks into things they don't understand... The Scarlet Flame Guard are quite troublesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ah, that's right. Speaking of the Envylian knights...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I've heard a couple of therian knights will be performing a war dance at a parade soon. Why don't you go see it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I believe it's someone named D'Artagnan and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's been a while, but we work together as well as always, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Practicing, are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I wasn't sure what I was going to do when you said no at first. I'm glad you changed your mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Why the change of heart?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I just thought that I should do whatever I can if I can do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We may have solved this case, but other things like it may happen. Not to mention all the other dangers out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That's why I want lots of different kinds of people to become a knight of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I thought that maybe my war dancing could help get people interested in joining. Besides—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'd like for everyone in the village to see my abilities. See that I've found a good place to lend my strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I see. You were a troublesome pup, but it seems that I no longer need to worry about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Captain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Now be honest, you really just like performing with D'Artagnan, isn't that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Captain! I assure you, I'm taking this very seriously!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Your tail is wagging.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It is! Your tail is so cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Th-this isn't what it looks like!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Waaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Ehehe! I like performing with you too! I'm so glad we get to do it together again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>D'Artagnan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'm glad, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>All right! Let's give it one more go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Right!</td>
