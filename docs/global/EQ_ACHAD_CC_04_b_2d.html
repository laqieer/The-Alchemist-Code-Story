<td>Bet he thought he could just do whatever he wanted. I mean, he jumped into the middle of the arena during a match! He even wounded that artificial maiden chick.</td>
</tr>

<td>Pretty sure those Colosseum matches were fixed, anyway. The owner had it coming.</td>

<td>Then, when all spectators were dead and gone, he just vanished.</td>

<td>Vanished? You don't mean that literally?</td>

</tr>
