<td>Hey, whatever happened to that jester guy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>His powers were on a whole other level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Bet he thought he could just do whatever he wanted. I mean, he jumped into the middle of the arena during a match! He even wounded that artificial maiden chick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Pretty sure those Colosseum matches were fixed, anyway. The owner had it coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah, it was hard to watch what he did to his slaves. The things he put them through for a simple opening act...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That jester killed everyone in the arena that day, didn't he? I'm glad I decided not to attend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ahh, but I heard it wasn't the jester who killed 'em.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I thought he was the one who interrupted the match?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Apparently he just stood there, laughing, as the arena got turned into a bloodbath!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Then, when all spectators were dead and gone, he just vanished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Vanished? You don't mean that literally?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I dunno! That's just what the rumors say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, where do you think he ended up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ahahahaha! I'm so glad I came to see the show!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Haa...haa...haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You've reached your limit. You can stop now, Am. You've done really well. We'll make some adjustments to the gear later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>S-Sol!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Don't worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ahh, of course! I understand now! What's the use of having a spotlight in the underground theatre if there's no one on the stage?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Of course! That is why you must take the stage, Amu! Don't you see?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Can't you shut up? You've lost, Jester.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Oh, Sol! I knew I could count on you for a good show, and you didn't disappoint! You're giving me chills!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Follow me, Amu! I think it's high time we brought out your true colors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The final act requires a brilliance to rival the shining sun! Or else the arrival of the long-awaited light will be ruined!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Come now, Amu. You don't have to keep pretending to be the heroine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Drop the act. Aren't we both the villains of this play?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I don't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Your poor, oppressed little soul was just yearning to be unleashed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And it was. She's free now. We made that happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No, no, no, no! You don't understand! I'm talking about a time much further in the past!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Amu, do you remember our first encounter? Did it not feel like destiny? It did to me! That's why I helped you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>H-helped me? You're the one who...who...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Be honest, now. Wasn't it a relief to be defeated by me? To lose your deadweight friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>A relief?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Why, yes! Wasn't it freeing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>"If I lose, I'll be thrown away." "If I fight back, my friend will be in trouble."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Those were the beliefs that held you back. You had to tell yourself those things in order to repress what you truly felt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>"Go get yourself killed! Just lose a match, and throw it all away! I won't miss you!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You bottled up your feelings...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>"I suppose Bianca could draw in customers. I've left her alone up till now, because you've been doing so well in your fights."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Until they all came bursting out...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>And you killed every last person in the Colosseum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It was absolutely enthralling, seeing you at work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Enough of your lies! You were the one responsible forâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Who, me? Oh, no. That wasn't me! "I did it! It was me!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I-is that supposed to be my voice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That's right! You did it. You killed them! Every last one of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Y-you're wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Am I? Are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I-I lost to you! And you...you killed Bianca... Y-you took my left eye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You have hands, don't you? Use them while you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You have hands, don't you? Use them while you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Nngh... Aaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Once, you were a simple marionette, performing in the comedies directed by your puppeteer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>No, no, no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Now you stand on Sol's stage, pretending to be the heroine, costar of the show.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Don't...kill...them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The only thing that's changed is the director. You're still a lowly puppet with no talent of your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Give...it...back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You're just a pitiful girl who tries to find her purpose in the dreams of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Indeed. You're so pathetic, it hurts to look at you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Kill! Die! Kill! Die! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Kill! Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Are you starting to remember? Those lines were part of your script.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Ngh... Ahhh... Aaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Your repressed guilt manifested itself as dependence towards the first person willing to reach out to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>But even paying penance with both of your arms couldn't satisfy that pent-up remorse of yours, could it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>No...no...no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Hehehe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You really do look so much like mama.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Bang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You're becoming a bit of an eyesore, I'm afraid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>This power...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You've done well to set the stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>You're welcome. But this is your last act.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Oh! I almost forgot to ask you. Did you enjoy the throne?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>A throne fit for the sun! Surely it must have arrived by now? I used the people of Lost Blue to send it your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>That crappy little chair came from you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I was right to believe in your bluff and bluster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You truly are a worthy ruler!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>What do you want from me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I humbly seek a reward for my services.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>The sixth spot is still available, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I'm not giving that number to a fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>But I could be the Sixth Templar! You could call me Zechs! It's a rather fetching stage name, wouldn't you agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Stop joking around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>My commandment could be Disillusioned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>More like Distasteful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>That still works for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You're insane!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Oh, how I long to witness your final act, my liege!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>We'll see about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>You still don't have a clue, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Ngh... Aaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Amu?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>That's all right. In fact, it's better this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I don't believe it! Did he just teleport?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I am the unknown variable, X.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>If X stands for the ten of the Veda, then Z represents their end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Put them together, and you get ZX.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Disillusioned. Distasteful. The fool. The jester. Zechs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Oh, don't look at me like that.</td>
</tr>
