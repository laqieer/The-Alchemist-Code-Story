<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>The die they gave me has a complicated trick to it that's pretty difficult to keep straight. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, considering that it came from the best engineer in Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I had no idea they also worked with Chat Noir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, they did tell me to cooperate with Chat Noir if I saw him...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Have you met Chat Noir? He's a strange one. That's why I like him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Once he was but a foolhardy kitten, picking fights in all the wrong places. His eyes were too big for his paws, and his bold exploits landed him in a lot of trouble. He ended up losing half of his body to a rather nasty trap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Even so, he wouldn't hear a word of caution. You know what he told me? "They have something I want, and I'm going to steal it." He was looking at me when he said it, but I could tell that all he was seeing were those larger-than-life dreams of his.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There was nothing else for it, so I fixed him up. Thus, the Feline Double, the Great Phantom Thief Chat Noir was born!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh, dear. You look terribly confused. One doesn't need to be a fortune-teller to see that! Hahah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>In any case, if you run into Chat Noir, cooperate with him, will you? I ask you as much for your sake as his.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That was a whole week ago now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>He slipped out while I was dealing with that drunk... I wonder how that little thief's larceny went?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ahh! What am I saying?! The first rule of being an informant is to not ask questions about your clients!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>None of the people who come to me for the little slips of information I whisper in their ears have anything worth seeing in them, and it tires me out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Even Chat Noir turned out to be nothing more than a thieving criminal, didn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If he has something worth my while, I'll be another step closer to the truth! Ahh... Even just imaging it is just too much! I feel like dancing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Still, there was something different about that Chat Noir. He had a kind of...brightness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Watching him made me feel somehow warm inside. I almost felt like my heart was dancing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What is that brightness of his, I wonder?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And what did that engineer mean when he said that helping out that criminal would be for my sake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>How could that possibly be true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Unless... Is there something more to him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What could be so precious that he'd continue to pursue it even after losing half of his body?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hello there. Nice to see you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Chat Noir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That intel you provided me served me well. I bagged the treasure without any issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, well... You're welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Sadly, it wasn't the treasure I was seeking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No point sulking about it though! The Great Phantom Thief has no time to stand still! So, for my next target...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean it wasn't the treasure you were seeking? You don't mean I gave you bad intel—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh, no, not at all! You did exactly what I asked for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I just meant the treasure they had wasn't what I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The Great Phantom Thief is not interested in some generic bit of common treasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(There it is again... That brightness.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Why is it that you glisten so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You're just some common thief. How can you be so excited about your work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That die... I think I know who made that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>All those gimmicks tacked onto it are a dead giveaway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I can tell just by looking that intricate magical engineering went into building them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You'd definitely have to be a bit eccentric to pack so much into such a small device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm pretty attached to it now, actually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It's sort of like a little toy box.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That much is obvious. You're glowing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>When you're looking at the die, your eyes glisten with a certain excitement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Th-that's not what I meant earlier! I really saw it in you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Saw what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>W-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I... I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You don't know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I just get these impressions... Like, a certain ambience enveloping a person. Something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Most people that come to me to buy information are...muddied with corruption. I see this murky air about them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(I avoided having desires of any kind so that I wouldn't end up like them. I even kept myself from having a dream.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But you... You shine so bright, it's almost blinding. I even feel uplifted somehow just looking at you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I... Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hahah, sorry. I know it makes no sense. I'm sorry I can't explain it better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I just like dice in general. It's a tool of my trade, and each one is...packed with dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Dreams?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You never know what you'll get until you cast the die. It's full of possibilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That's a fun way to see things. I expect what you think makes me "shine" is pretty much the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>How's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I don't know what will come of the thing I'm wanting to steal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Wadatsumi has a saying. "The unknown is ever imagined." Fun, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What is it that you're wanting to steal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>The mystery of ancient times. I want to steal the truth of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>That's a dream if I ever heard one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Exactly! A great adventurous tale of the Great Phantom Thief, Chat Noir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You have to dream of adventure to get started on one, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>(Such arrogance! Insolent greed! He's talking about the crimes he's committing, but...he still shines bright in my eyes...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>(Is it because he has a dream to pursue?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>By the way, you really do good work. It's no wonder you were recommended to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Good, clean job... A sharp wit... You'd make a great partner for the legendary Chat Noir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Wha—?! Who are you people?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Your security's knocked out back there. You're all alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>If you don't want to get hurt, give us everything you've got! Not like you earned the cash fair and square, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Huh, the security here's supposed to be pretty tough. I'm impressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I don't think praise is what they're here for!</td>
</tr>
