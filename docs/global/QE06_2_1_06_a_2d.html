<td>Demons! Prepare to meet your maker!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Dancing flames, heed my call!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Now's our chance! Don't let up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Status Report! Our troops have suffered little damage. At this rate, victory will be ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hm… The demons are persistent. No matter how many of them we destroy, more keep coming…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We've got a long way to go until we stamp out this threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's only thanks to you, Lady Mitsuha, that we were able to corner them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>My duty is to protect the people of Wadatsumi as a member of the Aquila Rubrum royal family. You should expect nothing less.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That is why I entered the Phoenix Covenant…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But…our people grow weary of this never-ending war against the demons...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Are you not weary yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>…Our people need me. This is no time to rest on our laurels. We must deal with the situation at hand…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…What on earth!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So, you are the human leader with special powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>…Huzzaaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…Hm. Troublesome, indeed. This won't be as easy as I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You must be the demons' leader. Why have you appeared before me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Consider it a warning. We won't allow you to do as you please any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's time the tides of war shift in our favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>At this rate, demons will become extinct. Have you come to prevent that from happening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Say what you will--we demons will have the last laugh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Let me phrase it in a way you'll understand. If I defeat you, then humans will--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If I defeat you demons will--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Prevail!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Take that!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Arg--Quite impressive for just a scratch. Your skills are fearsome, puny human… Confound it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>"Puny humans" cannot match demons with power alone, so we must cultivate our minds…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We do not flaunt power like you do--we support one another--that is the source of our strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmph. We have no such concept. But so what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The mind has no shape. Chakra gives it shape, making it possible to interfere with others…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The "mind" evolved into "skill" through the Phoenix Covenant. That is the essence of our art and its depth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>…I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>With this art, we will defeat you demons… And…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You will know the fortitude of the Wadatsumi Aquila Rubrum lineage and the Phoenix Brigade which I command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>An ink technique?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>….</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You scattered my spell!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Who…or what are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We are one and the same. However, as you said, our source of power differs from you humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Your power derives from a concept unfamiliar to us. It's quite impressive, indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>However, did you think we would idly stand by as you devised power for yourselves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I may be chief among demons, but these two…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>They are born to become demon kings…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>…!!!</td>
