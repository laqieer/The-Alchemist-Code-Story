<td>Now's our chance! Don't let up!</td>

<td>Wadatsumi Soldier</td>
<td>Status Report! Our troops have suffered little damage. At this rate, victory will be ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Hm… The demons are persistent. No matter how many of them we destroy, more keep coming…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>We've got a long way to go until we stamp out this threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Soldier</td>
<td>It's only thanks to you, Lady Mitsuha, that we were able to corner them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>My duty is to protect the people of Wadatsumi as a member of the Aquila Rubrum royal family. You should expect nothing less.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>That is why I entered the Phoenix Covenant…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>But…our people grow weary of this never-ending war against the demons...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Soldier</td>
<td>Are you not weary yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>…Our people need me. This is no time to rest on our laurels. We must deal with the situation at hand…</td>

<td>…What on earth!?</td>

<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>You must be the demons' leader. Why have you appeared before me?</td>
</tr>

<td>It's time the tides of war shift in our favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>At this rate, demons will become extinct. Have you come to prevent that from happening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sp_ogre.png" alt="Discarnate Power" height="128"><br>Discarnate Power</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Let me phrase it in a way you'll understand. If I defeat you, then humans will--</td>

<td>Arg--Quite impressive for just a scratch. Your skills are fearsome, puny human… Confound it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>"Puny humans" cannot match demons with power alone, so we must cultivate our minds…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>We do not flaunt power like you do--we support one another--that is the source of our strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sp_ogre.png" alt="Discarnate Power" height="128"><br>Discarnate Power</td>
<td>Hmph. We have no such concept. But so what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>The mind has no shape. Chakra gives it shape, making it possible to interfere with others…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>The "mind" evolved into "skill" through the Phoenix Covenant. That is the essence of our art and its depth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sp_ogre.png" alt="Discarnate Power" height="128"><br>Discarnate Power</td>
<td>…I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>With this art, we will defeat you demons… And…</td>

<td>What!?</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sp_ogre.png" alt="Discarnate Power" height="128"><br>Discarnate Power</td>
<td>Your power derives from a concept unfamiliar to us. It's quite impressive, indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sp_ogre.png" alt="Discarnate Power" height="128"><br>Discarnate Power</td>
<td>However, did you think we would idly stand by as you devised power for yourselves?</td>
