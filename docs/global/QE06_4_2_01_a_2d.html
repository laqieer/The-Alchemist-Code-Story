<td>Apparently they've dived into Mikaboshi's consciousness...whatever that means. The rookie's explanation of it was much too ambiguous for me to understand.</td>

<td>I've noticed you persist in referring to Amane as a rookie. Why is that? It seems to me she's served your group admirably thus far, and for quite some time.</td>
</tr>

<td>That doesn't warrant—</td>

<td>Fair point. But even if I don't know you all that well yet, I've come to know Amane. And the way you talk about her, it seems like you see the same things in her that I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>She's a stout-hearted one, but still young. Makes her a little careless sometimes as a result, so somebody really needs to keep an eye on her, right?</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>You have experience smithing, Jubei?</td>

<td>The Black Star Clan's education is quite extensive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ugac.png" alt="Ugachi" height="128"><br>Ugachi</td>
<td>Only the legitimate heir has the skill necessary to complete the restoration, however. Which leaves me out.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ugac.png" alt="Ugachi" height="128"><br>Ugachi</td>
<td>No. It should be the strongest among us who leads. And though it pains me to admit it, that's you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/jube.png" alt="Jubei" height="128"><br>Jubei</td>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Well, what do we do now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ugac.png" alt="Ugachi" height="128"><br>Ugachi</td>

<td>Aren't there members of the Blade Fox and Blue Tongues securing the immediate area? I can hardly believe they'd be easily surmounted.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Physically, an old comrade. Though he now serves as a vessel for the Demon King.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
