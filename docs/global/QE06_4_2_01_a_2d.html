<td>They look surprisingly at peace. Almost as if they're asleep and dreaming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Apparently they've dived into Mikaboshi's consciousness...whatever that means. The rookie's explanation of it was much too ambiguous for me to understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm sure it's necessary to learn Kagutsuchi, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I've noticed you persist in referring to Amane as a rookie. Why is that? It seems to me she's served your group admirably thus far, and for quite some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, she surely has. But her general lack of experience is undeniable, nonetheless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That doesn't warrant—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Now, now! Captain Ugachi may have a sharp tongue, but it's clear he trusts Amane and her skills with everything he's got.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You, yourself, are an outsider, yet you speak as if you know me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Fair point. But even if I don't know you all that well yet, I've come to know Amane. And the way you talk about her, it seems like you see the same things in her that I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>She's a stout-hearted one, but still young. Makes her a little careless sometimes as a result, so somebody really needs to keep an eye on her, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Basically, you're tough because you care. Am I on the mark?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...I said she has a lack of experience, and I meant it. Your speculations on my intentions are nothing more than wild fantasy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heheh! Aww, are you blushing, Captain Ugachi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I am not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Suuuuure you're not. Anyway, Agatha, as you can see, you've got nothing to worry about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There's a real bond among those of the Blade Fox. It may not always be self-evident, but it's definitely there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I see. That actually does put my mind at ease a bit. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Are you worried about Logi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I am, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I have every faith in him. He'll be back. We share a very strong bond of our own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's reassuring to hear. Well, then, there's only one thing for us to do right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We've gotta make sure the situation here is improved, even just a little bit, before Logi and Amane pop back outta that rock. Isn't that right, Captain Ugachi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I believe I've told you before, I am not your captain. But you are correct that that is what we should be focusing on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I will make preparations for the restoration of Sumeragi. Kagutsuchi will only be needed for the final part.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We must repair the blade with the demon's horn before even getting to that point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You have experience smithing, Jubei?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The Black Star Clan's education is quite extensive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Only the legitimate heir has the skill necessary to complete the restoration, however. Which leaves me out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's thanks to you that we even have this opportunity, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Without you, the remnants of the Blade Fox would not have come together like this. We would have fallen to pieces, and each perished in some hopeless fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Honestly, I believe you are far more worthy to lead the Blade Fox than I could ever be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No. It should be the strongest among us who leads. And though it pains me to admit it, that's you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Gauche, yet honest, just like always. But even you must see that I'm simply not fit for command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I could never fill Lady Celis' shoes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Jubei...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I admit no such thing, Jubei. Raise that head of yours. You are, without question, the Blade Fox's Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I understand that's the role I've been given. And I will do all that I can to fulfill it. I owe Lady Celis that much, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>So get to work, then. We'll keep the place guarded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>All right. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Well, what do we do now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Protect the castle. Now that most of our essential fighting force is split between the Kagutsuchi and Sumeragi sides of things, we're a bit shorthanded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The demons may take this opportunity to launch an assault on us, and we cannot under any circumstances allow them to halt our restoration of the Sacred Three.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Aren't there members of the Blade Fox and Blue Tongues securing the immediate area? I can hardly believe they'd be easily surmounted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>One can never be too prepared for the unexpected around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Reporting! Tamba has breached the outer lines, and is now in the process of— Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Talk about timing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Who's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Physically, an old comrade. Though he now serves as a vessel for the Demon King.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>So an enemy in one sense, but an ally in another. That's a pretty rough spot to be in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What is to be found here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We are. As you can see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Spare me your witty repartee. I can...feel it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>There's something of great worth here. Something related to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ah...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Shush!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>If you know something, tell me, and I promise I'll let you live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Not sure I'd trust the word of big, scary demon like yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>And who might you be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>A friend of Amane's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>This doesn't concern you. Step aside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I respectfully disagree, and no, I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Then die where you stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Have you forgotten where you are? Deep behind enemy lines, surrounded on all sides, and you're really taking the time to taunt?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You still place yourself on the front line, even after losing one of your arms? You're an even bigger fool than I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You are free to think of me as such all you'd like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Do you really think you can defeat me with only one arm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I can at least hold you back for a time. And that's all that's needed here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>What would you gain by stalling me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Comrades. Who would come to our aid and take you down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I was just gonna say that! We kinda think alike, Captain Ugachi, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...I hate that you remind me of him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Why do you stand before me on behalf of Wadatsumi? You are not even of this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Is it so unthinkable to want to protect the things your friends hold dear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Even if it means you have to die for them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Hey, we'll see about that part.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Allow me to fight alongside you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You stay where you are, Agatha! Keep Logi and Amane safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi and I will handle this guy! If something happened to you, what would we tell Logi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Or do you think we can't hold our own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>No. I believe in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Then leave this fight to us. We'll oust this demon. You can bet on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I take it I'm right to think there is something noteworthy here, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>And I take it that's none of your business!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Did you honestly think you could hit me with something like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Not really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What's the matter? Can't dodge a few bullets?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>So, you strike from melee as I'm preoccupied with ranged attacks? How...distasteful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I'll just have to kill you off one at a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Quit spitting nonsense. You've angered me enough already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Oh? How so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>How so?! You cut down my comrades!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Hyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Hrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I won't let you pillage any further!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I will keep you glued to this spot, even if it costs me my life!</td>
</tr>
