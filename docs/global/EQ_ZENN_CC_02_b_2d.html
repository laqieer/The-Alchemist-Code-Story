<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>That should have been a fatal wound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, good. You're finally awake. Well, you can go. You're all healed up, without even a scar to tell the tale of your battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What happened to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh? Don't you remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A ruthless demon samurai who sheds neither blood nor tears felled you, and brought you to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Th—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I can't bear to look at him. A cold-blooded killer who can run an ally through with his katana without the slightest hesitation... His is the true face of evil. Begone from my sight, devil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I-I was using the back of my blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh? And I suppose that cut got there all by itself, did it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I-I managed to hold back with everyone else! But Na Zhu's blow was too heavy... I had to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm sorry? You "had to"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Here I thought you were a warrior of some skill, but it would seem you aren't worth much after all. You might have the look and study of a samurai, but you haven't a whit of the honor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Bu—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Apologize at once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>T-to who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>To Na Zhu, of course! It's only common decency to apologize when you hurt someone. Haven't you any manners to speak of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'v—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Of course not! You only put effort into your work, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You're a disgrace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I... I am sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Good. Was that so difficult?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Na Zhu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't push yourself on his account. You lost a lot of blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You...treat the soldiers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>As best I can, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You're incredible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>How sweet of you to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>When he struck me...I thought for sure I was a goner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>See?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I said I'm sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I owe you my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh, don't be silly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>How can I ever repay you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That won't be necessary. This is my job, you know. You just keep doing yours, stay healthy, and stay safe. That's all the thanks I need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Thank you. I won't forget this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You're very welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hey. Boss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I-I won't lose to you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's your turn now. Come on. Show me your wounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Th-they're fine. Don't trouble yourself with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I suppose humans do heal naturally. It takes time, but eventually you end up more or less the same as you were originally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>However, that does not mean you shouldn't be healed. There is still the risk of infection, after all. Now, show me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Incredible... It's like the wounds were never there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>This is why I was bought for such an exorbitant price. The healing powers of shrine maidens make us worth our weight in gold many times over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>This is a kind of magic, isn't it? I've heard of it. You use your magic rites to...materialize things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I have been tasked with healing soldiers wounded on the field of battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It may seem a simple art...but it is not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What do you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ack! Hrgh... Nrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>M-Mitsu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Our magic rites utilize a form of spiritual projection. We can materialize health and bestow it unto others by carving their wounds into our own spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>If overused... Well. It takes its toll, as you can see. It weakens us, both body and spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You've lost a lot of weight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Indeed... If war were to break out on a grand scale, I would not last a day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>This is why I am a sacrifice. I am the frail wheat, destined to feed the mighty soldiers of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It is my duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I...can't see you anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I won't be sustaining any more wounds for you to treat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hmhm... Tee hee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Why are you laughing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Oh, no, it's nothing. Hee hee. That's very good of you. I'll only wither faster if I have to keep healing you up, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>R-right. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>P-perhaps I could still come and see you...if it's just a little scrape?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Pfft... Hahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Wh-what's so funny?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Nothing, nothing. Only that you're quite pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Wh—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>And a coward, to boot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Ho—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You're meant to be the head of Imperial Security, are you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Can't you come and see me without a pretext?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I-I am not a coward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You once asked me if there was anything I desired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>And? Have you thought of something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I would like a bouncy ball.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>You mean one of those colorful cotton ones that children play with in Wadatsumi? What do you want one of those for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Why don't you find out yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I-I... Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Hmhm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Come visit me again, won't you? You have your pretext now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Welcome back, boss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I don't mean to be rude, but it seems you're really quite hopeless when it comes to anything outside work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Ho—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I don't know how many centuries that pile of washing was there for, but I was worried it was about to gain sentience, so took care of it for you. I've given the whole house a good spring-clean, too, from top to bottom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Wh—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Dinner's ready when you are! I've had a little taste, and it's delicious, if I do say so myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Wh-what's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Oh! Didn't I mention? From this day forth, I, Na Zhu, shall be your roommate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>R-roommate?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>This is...really good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Don't worry, boss! I promise I'm not here to murder you in your sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I...wasn't worried about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>When I challenge you, it will be from the front, D. Lily style!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Hmm... Perhaps this detached lifestyle is the secret to your strength?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I-I doubt it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Ahh, then it must be that your selfless devotion to your duty leaves you with no time to focus on anything else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Th-that's not it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>No? Then you threw it all away, for the cause!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I can't cook like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Perhaps, but you can make someone's life flash before their eyes. I would know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>We're alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>O-oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>You remind me of...my younger self.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I-I do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>The purity of your devotion to this country... Your willingness to serve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Aha! Then you, too, are a patriot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>You want to defeat me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Then hold on to that heart of yours, Na Zhu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Wh-what do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I can tell by the way you handle your blade that you've been training diligently, for a long time. Your swordsmanship is...superb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>L-look, I'm not good at this kind of thing, but...you're already strong, Na Zhu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>So you should go. You don't want to be like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Oh, but I do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Please, let me stay with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I want to hear you praise me like that again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>That whelp really is something, isn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>He's been after your position from the very start. He made that clear to me during our first meeting. Of course, I quickly realized he didn't have what it takes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Maybe not now...but in time, I'll have to watch my back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>True... Sometimes I feel like I'm looking at a copy of your younger self. He's just as reckless as you were. I plan to hold on to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Anyone who makes me think I can count on them to do what needs to be done—whatever needs to be done—is valuable to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>And right now, I know I can count on you most of all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>You are a tool with infinite possibilities. Few hearts lie outside the range of your blade. You are as essential to me as a lion's claws are to its hunt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Yes... You will be indispensable to me as I expand my path of conquest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>I suppose that means I am quite...dependent on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>I am...flattered, my lord. Your words do me great honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>As such...there is something you must know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>What is it, my lord?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>We are going to war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>We have a shrine maiden who can heal our soldiers up good as new, no matter how badly injured they are. Her abilities are too miraculous to waste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>So we are going to invade Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
