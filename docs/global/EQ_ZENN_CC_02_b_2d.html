<td>I can't bear to look at him. A cold-blooded killer who can run an ally through with his katana without the slightest hesitation... His is the true face of evil. Begone from my sight, devil!</td>

<td>Apologize at once!</td>

<tr>

<td>That won't be necessary. This is my job, you know. You just keep doing yours, stay healthy, and stay safe. That's all the thanks I need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/naju.png" alt="Na Zhu" height="128"><br>Na Zhu</td>

<td>It's your turn now. Come on. Show me your wounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>Th-they're fine. Don't trouble yourself with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>I suppose humans do heal naturally. It takes time, but eventually you end up more or less the same as you were originally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>However, that does not mean you shouldn't be healed. There is still the risk of infection, after all. Now, show me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>Incredible... It's like the wounds were never there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>This is why I was bought for such an exorbitant price. The healing powers of shrine maidens make us worth our weight in gold many times over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>This is a kind of magic, isn't it? I've heard of it. You use your magic rites to...materialize things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>I have been tasked with healing soldiers wounded on the field of battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>It may seem a simple art...but it is not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>What do you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Ack! Hrgh... Nrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>M-Mitsu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Our magic rites utilize a form of spiritual projection. We can materialize health and bestow it unto others by carving their wounds into our own spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>If overused... Well. It takes its toll, as you can see. It weakens us, both body and spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>You've lost a lot of weight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Indeed... If war were to break out on a grand scale, I would not last a day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>This is why I am a sacrifice. I am the frail wheat, destined to feed the mighty soldiers of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>It is my duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>I...can't see you anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>I won't be sustaining any more wounds for you to treat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Hmhm... Tee hee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Why are you laughing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Oh, no, it's nothing. Hee hee. That's very good of you. I'll only wither faster if I have to keep healing you up, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>R-right. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>P-perhaps I could still come and see you...if it's just a little scrape?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Pfft... Hahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>Wh-what's so funny?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Nothing, nothing. Only that you're quite pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Wh—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>And a coward, to boot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ho—</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You're meant to be the head of Imperial Security, are you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Can't you come and see me without a pretext?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>I-I am not a coward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>You once asked me if there was anything I desired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>And? Have you thought of something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>I would like a bouncy ball.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>You mean one of those colorful cotton ones that children play with in Wadatsumi? What do you want one of those for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Why don't you find out yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>

<td>Hmhm...</td>

<td>Come visit me again, won't you? You have your pretext now.</td>
