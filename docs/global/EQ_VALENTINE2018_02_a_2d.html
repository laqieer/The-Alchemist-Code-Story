<td>N-now that I think about it, the textbook did say that the Rainbow Cacao drew monsters to it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh, really? You still remember that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, anyway... You see why it's better to have more people available to fight, just in case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>As you can see, this is the genuine article! The young ladies just can't get enough of this stuff either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Young ladies and monsters aren't exactly equivalent things, but I suppose you're not wrong...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes!!! I got my hands on some Rainbow Cacao! With this, we can make some fantastic chocolate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hmph. If you're going to give it to who I'm thinking of, isn't the purple cacao the best choice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wha... What are you trying to say?! Rude! Come on, let's get going before this melts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm pretty sure the cacao isn't going to melt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ah, youth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Perhaps we ought to have stopped them from using the purple cacao...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Back in the day, I used to make chocolate like that, too... I tried so many different recipes. I needed to be prepared just in case I met the perfect husband.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Me too! My three friends and I used to make it together! It was so much fun..</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So people have been enjoying Valentine's Day for generations! How lovely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I never said anything about enjoying it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's fine, Albea! You still have plenty of chances to enjoy it to its fullest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You'll be making chocolate this year for your big brother again, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>H-hey! Nobody needs to know that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Valentine's, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Noah, you're not done yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Almost... Tsk. How could this get so disorganized? Despite all the trouble the school has gone through to number everything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Does that really matter? I mean, at least they're all on the shelf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's not the issue here. It's about respect... Huh? What's that, Emma?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh? The chocolate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The chocolate...? You know that food and drink aren't allowed in the library. Chocolates and sweets aren't allowed on the Academy campus at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Eh, it's not a big deal. What's with you today, Noah? You seem kind of out of sorts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh? You mean about Valentine's? Ugh. It's just another ridiculous holiday. Such a waste...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Mmph...?! W-what the?! You can't just go shoving chocolate into people's mouths like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I like that one a lot. Isn't it delicious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I mean, it is pretty good, but that's not the point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Come on, hurry up. I'll even help you out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What is with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, you were always bringing chocolates and stuff onto the Academy grounds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Chocolates and sweet snacks like these aren't going to hurt anyone. Like I said, itâ€™s not a big deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Not a big deal? Emma, it's against the rules! You know that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh, Noah. You're such a stick in the mud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The two of you really are close, huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You there! What are you doing? There's a monster on the loose in the school!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No way! In the school?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh no! We'd better get over there quickly!</td>
