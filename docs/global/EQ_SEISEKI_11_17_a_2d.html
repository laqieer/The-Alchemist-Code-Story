<td>Shut up!</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Grk?!</td>

<td>Wh-what...a joke... No matter how exhausted I might be...there is no way I could...lose to you.</td>

<tr>

<td>What is that? Some kind of light from his arm?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I have no idea what that might be. I've never sensed anything like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>O-of course you haven't... It's a power...that those like you...who know nothing but this world...could never know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>His arm is...dissipating?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is he driving it into another dimension?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I-impressive... I guess I should...have expected that...from the Hero of Lost Blue. Clever... Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I-I can't believe...it's come to this. I was...saving this f-for...fighting Nimul.</td>

<td>Never did it cross...m-my mind...that I'd have to use this...against you lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I don't know what...y-you all were counting on...but there is no limit to my power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh, no! Kanon!</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ugh! Everybody, please! Lend me your strength once more!</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>What?! Now is not the time for blind gallantry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Captain Kudan, you can't underestimate him just because he's wounded!</td>

<tr>

<td>Heh...ugh! Fool...</td>

<tr>

<td>Are...you so eager to...d-die? I am happy to oblige!</td>

<td>You...c-can't use that...power.</td>

<tr>

<td>A-Acht!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Don't...cross that line. You'll n-never...be the...same.</td>

<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If...your soul is lost...I-I won't be able to...f-follow. P-please, Sol...</td>

<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Like I said, here is your answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You could defeat me right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You have the power to do so, yet you lack the conviction to see your ambitions through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Y-you...! Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Do you understand now what the difference between victory and defeat is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You don't, do you? There is only one difference. You still cling to your bonds to others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>M-my...bonds?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Your comrades and your home, all the things you feel the need to protect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>These bonds kept you from crossing the line into absolute isolation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That means you do not yet understand true despair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Those who do not understand the meaning of despair can never lead the world where it needs to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>D-despair? Nngh... What are you on about...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Be careful! He's still building up energy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Captain Kudan! Don't get too close!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>All you've been doing is lamenting and grieving over your own misfortunes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You've never thrown yourself into absolute solitude by cutting all ties you have with those you love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I, on the other hand... I have chosen to sever all connections I had with this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I've burned bridges with my friends, my past, and even my physical being for the sake of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Nngh?! N-no, stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>For the sake of this world, I will not hesitate to become a demon in the eyes of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Without the conviction to do the same, you will never be able to kill me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Nngh! Aaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Dead the End!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>D-did he do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>He finally got him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>C-conviction...to...cut ties?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yes. That is the line that separates those who lead from those who follow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Nngh! Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>H-how could I...be defeated...by...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>S-Sol...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>A-Acht...? I...I am the...s-sun...born in the sunken...city without light. Y-you have...n-nothing to worry...about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I...w-will never...fall. I will always...l-light...your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>S-Sol...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>M-my light...will always be...with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Th-thank...you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Mmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>S-Sol is... He's finally...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>The Templars...are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>We beat them!!! Huzzaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Finally. This should tip the scales of this battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Indeed. Kanon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>You left us...to pursue true isolation? True...despair? Is that what you said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>It is. Had I not done so, I could never attain the strength required to lead the world into a new era.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>How could you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Huh. I don't know how convincing your words are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>From where I'm standing, it just looks like you're making excuses to yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>The teamwork you two displayed a moment ago... I think that tells us everything we need to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>What was it you said? The justice of "our" continent? Admit it, you missed us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I suppose there is no point in lying. I did feel some sense of nostalgia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I must admit that I couldn't help but remember the days we fought shoulder to shoulder, charging forward toward the same goal...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>But those days are over. It does not change the fact that I do not need any of you with me to fulfill the goals I have now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Are you saying the bond you share with Kagura is something you can sever without a second thought?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>That is a ridiculous question. It was that bond that I had to separate myself from the most.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Why?! Though she never said it out loud, you were always on Kagura's mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Long after you left this world, she never forgot about you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>She never stopped feeling remorse for failing to hold you back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Didn't you care for Kagura as well?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>You don't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>You're the one who doesn't understand! Don't you see how important you were to—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>It is exactly because she was so important to me that I had to get away from her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Wh-whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I-it's an earthquake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Look there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>That pillar of light... Could it be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>The Tower of Babel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Orion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Hey, you there. Protect Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Wait, what? Me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>You seem tough enough to live through this chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I expect you to keep her by your side. Got it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>You just said... I mean, I thought you chose not to care about Captain Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>That's true. I don't care about her anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I simply felt that a farewell gift was necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>A...what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Kagura followed me around like a little sister. I felt it necessary to be strong enough to protect her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>There were times I failed to protect her, and I often considered isolating myself to achieve true power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Kagura was always there when I needed to grow stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>There is no denying that I am who I am thanks to Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Ensuring her safety is my parting gift to the past I share with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I leave the task of keeping her safe to you. That's all there is to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Captain Kagura loved you like a brother, and yet you left her...just so you could gain more power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>That's so selfish! What about her feelings?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Did you not think of how crushed she would be?! She's not some—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Reports are in! Greed Dike forces have breached the final line of defense! They will reach us here at any moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Whoa! Another one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>The Tower of Babel is glowing brighter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>We have to do something, but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>What are you worried about? Go on, Kanon. Go to the Babel Ruins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>It's your job to stop Orion, isn't it? Leave the rest to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>But you're all Phantoms, so if I leave this place...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I thought we already told you. You were not the one who summoned us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>That's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>You should focus on stopping Orion. Besides, look at all these friends you can count on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>She's right. Some of us haven't had our share of hell-raising yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Aw, yeah! I'm so pumped right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>We can't go home without a heroic tale or two for Natalie and Ren! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>We won't let Greed Dike run wild! Come on, Spica, let's get in on this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>See, Kanon? Leave this fight to us. We're counting on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Thank you, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Sorry to burst your bubble, but there's no place for you in the coming battle against Orion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Jolting Strike!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Wh-what? What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>I'm going alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>After seeing you fight against Sol, I can tell you're in no way ready for this conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>You'll only get in my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>You don't plan on fighting Orion alone, do you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>You all can huddle together as you always do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Leave it to me to shoulder the despair of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Farewell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Captain Kudan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Shoulder the despair of this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Wow, I didn't think he'd go this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Captain Kudan plans to sacrifice himself to shield us from the calamities Orion will unleash upon this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>So he left us here...to protect us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>I guess we should have expected him to act like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>He always had an especially strong sense of justice, and cared very deeply for the well-being of his friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Apparently, despite severing his ties with both his friends and his past, he hasn't forsaken us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>In fact, he abandoned us in order to gain the strength necessary to protect us all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>I know, I know. Kanon, we'll be going ahead now, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>There's no time to waste. You know what you must do, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>I do! I cannot let Captain Kudan fight alone! Stopping Orion is my responsibility!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>I'm sorry to leave you all, but I'll be going to join Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>All right, let's go! This will be the final battle to defend the justice of this world!</td>
</tr>
