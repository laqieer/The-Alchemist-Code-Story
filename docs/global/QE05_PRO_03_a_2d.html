<td>Urgh, ngh! G-get off of me, you fool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's my line, you lop-sided ape! Your oversized widget is hitting my—who-ho-hoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ahem. People are free to have whatever hobbies they like, yes, and I don't judge, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don, this is the middle of the street. I don't think the citizens appreciate seeing this...display. The gang's gonna get laughed at for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Tango?! N-no! You've got this all wrong, you idiot! We didn't do this to ourse—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey! That girl! Where did she go?! The one with black hair and a katana!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It looks like she left the city. We followed her, but she was too fast for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Argh! All this trouble and she got away?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We were able to get some clues about what that girl's looking for though. Hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Eek! D-don't hurt me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>She asked me 'bout the Mikaboshi, but all I told her was that I don't know anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You ignoramus. It's a stone in Wadatsumi that is said to have power comparable to the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Power comparable to the Sacred Stones?! Are you serious?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If we had that, then...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If such a thing really existed, I would have already informed Miss Fiona about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi has been lost since the age of the Lion Monarch's Charge. Don't you know anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Excuse me?! Whatever! Why would she be looking for some ancient relic anyways?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hey! Tell them everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Eek! I told her th-there was another guy that came by asking the same questions. She...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>She suddenly became so violent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Another guy? Who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>He said he was a Holy Guard knight from Lustburg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That said, he had long hair and didn't have any armor on, so he didn't really look like a knight to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>A long-haired...Holy Guard knight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Didn't you come to Lustburg in order to revive this stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I told her he mentioned heading to Gluttony Foss, and then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Th-that's it! That's all I told her! Please let me go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Tango, do me a favor, would you? Get this idiot off of me! I'm starting to get sick. Hey! Comb-head, are you listening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Gluttony Foss...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Like I said, the city's almost completely restored. If it wasn't, I wouldn't be here dawdling around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's so nice to see people helping each other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well, once the queen allowed us to make compromises for each other, things just sort of worked themselves out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That's such good news! Now all I need to do is get Voda to teach me how to change the insects back to human form!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That's nice, but aren't things worse here in Saga than in Lustburg? Saga suffered more direct damage to infrastructure and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No worries! All the tribes that were quarrelling with each other have come together to help rebuild!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I bet everything will be back to normal by the time you come to trade again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>In a month? I doubt... Well, sure. Why not? Anyway, next time I'm in town, I'll bring you news about Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Thanks! Oh! If you see Alma or Rebecca, let them know I'm doing great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I've told you, I don't know who those people are. Good day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Thanks, Mister! Oh man, I can't wait to hear more about all my friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>If you wish to know more about Lustburg's current affairs, I may be able to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Eek?! S-since when were you standing there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You are Lisbeth Finn Lustburg, I presume?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh? Uh, y-yes! Nice to meet you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Nice to...meet you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Uhm, who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Never mind who I am. I will tell you news of Lustburg in exchange for information on a man named Dias Elysion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Information about Dias?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>While in Lustburg, I heard that you were close to this man. Could you tell me more about him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What do you intend to do about him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Do not fear. I mean you no harm. I just wanted information about him before I met him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I... I can't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I don't want to! I don't even know who you are, so it would be wrong for me to tell you anything about Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You are just like that blond man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hmph. I cannot reveal my identity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>If you know too much about me, harm may come your way. That is not my intention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You're lying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You were concerned about how close Dias and I were... You like him, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>As...a love interest? Really, it surprises me that you've survived these violent times with such a naive soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Naive? You think a person can't fall in love unless they're naive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Whatever. I simply wanted to gather information on the man in case I needed a contingency plan. Sorry to bother you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Are you running away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Are your feelings for Dias something you can just cast aside like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What are you...? I was simply trying to keep you from getting too invo—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>It's fine. I just want you to know that I won't let myself be outshone by someone who runs away from their feelings!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You're so flat, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Your chest. You have a flat chest. How can you be so confident with such inferior assets?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I...!!! How dare—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Even if we were to become rivals in love, I will never be bested by the likes of you. You have the figure of a boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I-it's not like you have any, ahem, assets!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Excuse me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You're flat-chested, too! Who gives you the right to judge me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I am not flat-chested!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Liar! You can hide behind that armor, but I can tell from your figure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I am most certainly not! I wear a binder to—what are you making me say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>This is a fight I cannot lose!</td>
