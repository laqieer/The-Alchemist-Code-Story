<td>So...what did you want to discuss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Um... Recently, there are a lot of scary animals around this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Monsters, I believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The horses and rabbits are scared, and they can't take naps in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>And also...huh? Gato?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Zzz...zzz...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hey...Gatooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...Mmm...ah, sorry. The rhythm you speak in is so calming, Melia, I can't help myself from getting sleepy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So, um...you want to protect the animals from the monsters that have been appearing around here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Um, yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And...I realized from before that the monsters don't really seem to approach you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm usually playing a music instrument, so I'm sure the monsters are warded off by that sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Then, if I play an instrument too, then scary monsters won't come near me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's possible. If you'd like, I can teach you the basics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...! Pl-please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well then, let's begin with a simple melody. I'll play it first so please watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wow...! It sounds so beautiful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'll lend this to you. Please try to play it in the same manner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>O-okay! Um, like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ah... I didn't know that instrument was capable of making such sounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Sigh... It's difficult...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's never easy for anyone at first. It all comes down to practice...although there may not be time for that at the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Gurrruu...grrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It appears to have enticed the monster instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>N-no...</td>
