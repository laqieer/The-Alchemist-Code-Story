<td>Wow... The two of them certainly are remarkable warriors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hmm... You know, I feel like Itsuki seems somewhat hesitant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Not bad for a human! Didn't expect you to put up a fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Why do you feel the need to keep mentioning that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Humans this and demons that... You're the only one who cares about that here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The only reason you can say that is because you've never had to live as a demon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You've never been persecuted for being who you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I have been betrayed, time and time again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I wanted to trust humans. I wanted to believe! But you humans could never accept us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There is no demon before me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I see no demon. Before me stands a worthy rival, and that is all that matters to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huzzaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Aaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>A clean hit! Show's over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Are you all right, Itsuki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You see no...demon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Erm... Itsuki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Argh! I can't believe I lost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well, I suppose a promise is a promise. I am sorry about what I said earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>There's no need for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I felt your struggle. That was enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Suzuka...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm back! Seems like everything's all good now. Did something happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Nothing too crazy, I hope? Anyway, let's get to making some chocolate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Itsuki, if you don't mind... Would you like to make chocolate with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I, uhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I know that I cannot hope to fully understand the hardships you have had to endure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yet I would like for you to make the best of your time as a Phantom in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I guess I was the only one who was obsessing over this, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Do you think...I could make chocolate as good as that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm sure you could. I've done it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Course you can! It's dead easy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>All right! Let's make some chocolate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yay! Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>So! We'll be needing this to make chocolates like the ones we tried earlier, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What? Hot peppers?! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I love spicy food! That chocolate we had earlier was so good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I want to make some that's even spicier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Is everybody ready? Let's get this party started!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It seems that Itsuki was the one who ended up with the other spicy chocolate. Are we just going to let her do this, Emma?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Mmm... Why not? Who says chocolate has to be sweet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Pfft! All that matters is that we're all having fun. Isn't that what Valentine's Day is all about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>All people are equal under the deliciousness of chocolate. Have a nice, sweet Valentine's Day!</td>
