<td>Wow, this place is amazing! There's so many people--so much cool stuff!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yep, it's the holiday market all right. Even just looking around is a lot of fun. I love it too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...This is great! There's so much here. Now I'll definitely be able to find the perfect present for Ishi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh? You're gift shopping?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Last winter holiday Ishi got me a gift, but I didn't get anything for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ishi's a special girl. And my special pillow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>She really helped me out this year. She's always been there for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(But I left her all alone...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Rochelle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Anyway, Ishi loves the holidays, so I've got to get her the perfect present this year!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The perfect present... *sigh*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>W-what's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...But what is it!? I have no idea what the perfect present would be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You never even asked her what she wanted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I was so wrapped up with everything else that I never got around to it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I wonder what kind of present she'd like. Do you have any ideas?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>H-huh? Why ask me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well you were with her the other day when you came to get us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We hadn't seen each other in quite a while, so I thought you might know more about her than me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't think I do, but... Hmm, I really don't know what she'd like...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But I bet she'd like anything, as long as you picked it out for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Maybe... But what should I pick...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>HMMM...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I...have no idea. Let's just go look for those decorations for now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Good idea. Maybe you'll stumble upon a good present while we're searching.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh, I bet you're right! You're good at this, Ravi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ehehe... Come on, let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Decorations for a snow sculpture? Sorry, nothing like that arrived here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh, I see... Now what, Rochelle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We can't give up that easily. Black and white bears always find their prey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Where could they have gone? Maybe they got lost somewhere along the way? I'm gonna keep looking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wow, black and white bears are something else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hmm, now that you mention it... I heard the goods from the craftsman in the forest were never actually delivered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huh? Why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It sounds like the person delivering those packages was attacked by a monster along their route and had everything stolen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>They weren't hurt, though. It sounds like the monster was only after the packages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>After that, some guards were sent out to patrol the woods, but there hasn't been any sign of the packages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>This is worse than we thought! We need to go back and tell the others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yeah, let's hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(This whole winter holiday thing is harder than I thought...)</td>
