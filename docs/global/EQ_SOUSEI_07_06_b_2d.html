<td>Grrraaaaaaahh!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Grrr, I can't get close!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The corruption is too dense! The magil of this sin is so thick even its density creates pressure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Then would purifying her through Alchemy work? I have to get close to Benika to try!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No, that wouldn't work. If she takes any more damage than this, she'll...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Grr... At this rate, we won't be able to stop her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Skree! Skree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That baby dragon is...sucking the corruption out of Benika?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Then this should work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Benika, wake up! You cannot lose to this level of corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Is that...? Yna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You still have to accept my birthday present to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A dagger?! What are you planning—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Aaauggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yna, what did you just do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Something I learned with in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This dagger is imbued with the same spell as the one on the Gear of Judgement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It stripped the sin magil from Benika's body and sealed it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Does that mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Was that the technique that allowed you to defeat a Cursed Beast even without the ultimate gear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Although it may be different from the power we aspire to, it appears to be another type of worthy power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What do you plan to do now, Lord Kubera? Will you be relinquishing your quest for the ultimate gear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We will need it eventually, to vanquish a god. However, it is not necessary at this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If it is possible to slay Mammon with their method... There is still time to ruminate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Until then, we shall survive on and search for our path, my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Good grief. You are as soft-hearted as ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Heh... I suppose it is the privilege of the powerful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Wait... Something is wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yna... Big brother... I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It's all right. You have nothing to worry about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I see. I... The corruption... I'm sorry for causing you trouble again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's only right that a brother saves his little sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, that's right! Where is Luke?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The young dragon? Over there—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Rrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Grrrooooooggghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This magil...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Luke?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Grrraaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>There's no mistaking it. It's the same as when Nidhogg succumbed to corruption!</td>
