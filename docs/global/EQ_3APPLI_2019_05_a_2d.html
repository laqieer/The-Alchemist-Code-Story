<td>Nyx! Can you hear me?! It's me! Hiiragi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm going to tell you the answer to your question!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>When you asked me if I would be your girlfriend...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Even if it was just a lie or an act...I was happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's why I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Way of the Ninja—Shadow Clone! There is no end to them! There are so many, and they are indeed terrifying to behold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>All of you must flee! Immediately! The Way of the Ninja is a dreadful thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Thing is, that's not the only dreadful thing happenin'. Maybe it's all this turmoil turnin' 'em onto us, but now we've got a whole wall of monsters assailin' the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is the terror that is the Way of the Ninja!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Isn't it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I-I dunno! Well, there's this pillar of light at the edge of town...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The ninjas're disappearin' into thin air!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But that sounds like...! Way of the Ninja—Camouflage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No... That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You went to meet your master, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I will deal with the monsters. Now, all of you must flee! Run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Having been burdened with the sin of lust, such things as love are impossible for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yet, as you continue to fight...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I am certain that none of you will be enticed by anything like the darkness which troubles me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Still...I, too, have someone who I would very much like to meet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Gwaaaaaaaaaarrgghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I am certain that this isn't lust...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But simply love, plain and simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>To me, love is now a longing of a faded past, a past that I have overcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I miss the days I spent with my kunoichi sisters, fighting alongside them in our world... That was the normal me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hiiragi's heartfelt words cleansed the Ragi-Boo of their corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>As soon as the greater part of the indefinite elements were removed, Nyx and Mira kick-started the Chance Encounter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I guess I'm dumped, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We both know that this is exactly how you planned it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well, I was pretty worried. It was touch and go back there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Were you in on it too, Mira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm just glad I was able to keep it together! It was a close call, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I didn't think I'd end up getting swallowed up by the corruption, but thankfully, Hiiragi figured it all out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>He is my little brother, you know? That's why I went along with his plan. All of it was to defeat the Lovesickness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>All kinds of powers and desires got muddled together, preventing us from affecting the creature itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We needed to find the owners of each of those powers and desires and have them reveal those qualities for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>First, there was the longing to fall in love. In order to figure out who that desire belonged to, Nyx began confessing his feelings left, right, and center.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yup. It was pretty obvious who my target would be, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Pffft!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Then we heard about how this Lovesickness had a lot to do with the kunoichi, which pretty much confirmed things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>All that was left was to incite Mira's recklessness, so that I could use her to deepen my relationship with Hiiragi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That's no way to treat your family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Then force Almace to display her battle prowess, which the Lovesickness had also inherited...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I ended up being the one to dispel my own recklessness, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Longing isn't something you should hold on to forever, you know. Maybe my methods were a little, er, unorthodox, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Your Hiiragi Harem was more than a little unorthodox!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I-I know. It was base and vile of me to even conceptualize it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I hope you're ashamed of yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Can't really praise his methods. At least we know for sure now that Nyx has some recklessness in him, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Only sometimes...and maybe that's not such a bad thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Well, you've definitely provided the perfect example of what not to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I'm really sorry, ladies. I've been a naughty boy, toying with you all like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Nrgh! Nyx!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We have had quite enough of your antics, young man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Love...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm not going to fall in love. Not after this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oooooraaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ooooooooraaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Give them their last rites, Hiiragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Okay. I really do miss my old life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Although my battles never ended, and although I suffered so much pain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>If I were unable to return to my normal life...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ooooooooraaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That would be a real nightmare!</td>
</tr>
