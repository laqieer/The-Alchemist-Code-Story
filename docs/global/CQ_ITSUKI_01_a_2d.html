<td>So this is where the last of the demons are hiding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That demon girl who escaped our last hunt... If not exterminated, she will surely attack nearby villagers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Master Exorcist, please. Please rid us of this terrible demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This place is no good, either. There are no longer any safe havens for my kind left in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I have nowhere to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>They've all been killed. Every one of them is gone and now I'm all alone. The only one left behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Umgf...mmff...mmm! This is so good! Excuse me! Can I have seconds, please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Here you are, missy. I even added some extra hot peppers, just for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wow! Thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You a traveler, little missy? I've never seen anybody dressed like you around here before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sort of. I come from Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wadatsumi? Ahh...I see. That must've been really tough for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(Heh. Greed Dike wiping out Wadatsumi made it easy for me to slip away among the refugees, so I felt pretty lucky, actually.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah, it was a pretty rough ordeal. Can I have another, please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You sure eat a lot, honey. I've never seen a girl your age eat this much before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh... Is it...weird?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Weird? Hahahah! Oh my, no! I'm just saying I'm impressed, missy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Right! O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(Phew... I'm lucky that the people of this country don't really know much about demons.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(It's gonna...be okay...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Demons are gluttonous monsters. They will attack humans and devour them all the way to the bone when hungry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You must kill them before they get you. Kill them before they feed. Kill them all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Humans came crashing down on our village with that belief in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>As we had believed that we could coexist with the humans, we were not prepared to defend ourselves against the attack. They slaughtered us before we could even put up a fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Father! Father!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Itsuki! Run! Get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We thought that we could trust each other and live peacefully side by side...but that was nothing more than a fantasy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(Going on a murderous rampage, ignoring what trust we had built between us... Who are the real monsters here?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(Ugh! I just want to eat all this stress away!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>This looks so good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I hope you enjoy it</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You know, come to think of it... There is one girl I know who eats about as much as you. Oh! Well, speak of the devil...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I am starved! Oh, wow, that is a delightfully big serving! Very nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh, my apologies. I just woke up, so I'm not all here yet. You know how it is. My name is Sofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>They serve some of the best meals here, don't they? I completely understand wanting to eat so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But...why is it so red?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>She got a special dish! She wanted something really spicy, so I topped it off with loads of hot peppers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So this is all hot peppers? I've never had anything really spicy myself, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It must be delicious if you want such a large serving of it! Perhaps I should try it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wha—? Uhm...I mean, I think it's good, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(What is it with her? She's kind of cramping my style here.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(Are there a lot of people like her outside of Wadatsumi? She doesn't seem to be a bad person, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(Well, this isn't Wadatsumi. Maybe it'd be all right if I got to know some of these humans.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>W-would you like a bite?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>May I? Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Let me do a little fortune-telling first, if you don't mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Fortune-telling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Nothing... Nothing at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I will be going now. I suppose I'll have a taste some other time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huh? She just said she was hungry. Weird.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(I know I shouldn't get too involved with humans, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(I can't help but be curious.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I think I saw her head this way... Oh! There she is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What's with those guys surrounding her?! What are they up to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You just won't give up, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>The boss is really interested in your powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Your Elven powers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(An elf? She's not human?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Not even an elf could fight us all off, ain't that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Come with us quietly and you won't get hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>(So humans treat elves poorly too, huh?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>(I might have left Wadatsumi behind, but it looks like no matter which country I'm in, humans are all the same.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Wh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Who the heck are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The things you people do are always so despicable! I hate all of you!</td>
</tr>
