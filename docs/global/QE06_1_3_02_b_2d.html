<td>So what will we do now? Let me hear your thoughts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Well, first and foremost we have to think of some way to defeat the Discarnate Power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I will search for some clues in our records regarding demons. Hopefully there's a clue as to how to kill it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What I am more concerned about is the force field deep within the castle. The Discarnate Power said it was after what is kept there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It has been made abundantly clear that the Demon Paragon will come for it. There is no point feigning ignorance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What is being kept in the castle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Celis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I guess I can't keep it a secret any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I will tell you everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>How dare you keep that from us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I couldn't risk such information being leaked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So, just as the Discarnate Power said. Demons aim to eradicate humans and build a country of their own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>In order to achieve this, they plan to eliminate potential obstacles. It makes sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This is why we cannot allow Castle Aquila Rubrum, the home base of the Blade Fox to fall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>To do that, we must defeat the Discarnate Power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I will find a way to kill that thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'll do what I can too. I don't see myself ever taking a good nap in a world run by demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm counting on you two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>All right! Now that we're done here, let's have ourselves a feast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What makes you think we have time for such frivolity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We need to focus on the mission at hand. I'm going to be—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Did you just call meal time a "frivolity?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ugachi, you shouldn't have said that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Your mind cannot work properly without a good meal. You do know this, right? Do you not know this? Are you or are you not the captain of the Second Squad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Do you think someone who can't appreciate the little things in life is fit to be a captain? Are you qualified to bring peace to Wadatsumi? Answer me, Ugachi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's just that... Uh... I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Three meals a day is the foundation of life! Strength of mind and body comes from a hearty meal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Say it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But I just—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You want to stay home for the next mission? Is that what you're telling me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>H-hey...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Repeat what I said if you want to be part of this mission! What's the foundation of life?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Strength of mind and body comes from a hearty meal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Good! All right, I'm going to go prepare now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Every. Single. Time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You should just stop talking back to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Azami?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Thank you for the meal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hey! Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Training. I can't just stand around and do nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Uhm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What is it, Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Celis? Ahh, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Is this seat taken?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Celis...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Tanosuke was worried about you. He said you looked like you could use some advice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke said that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>He generally prefers not to get involved with other people's affairs, but he seems to really care for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>He does care about his subordinates, so try not to make him so worried, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Amane... What makes up your everyday life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>For me, it's getting to enjoy a meal like this with everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Everybody has something that makes up their everyday life. I used to think I had to protect all of it for everyone's sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But I could never find a way to do that. So I wield my blade so that I can come back to this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Eating connects people. Even those you left behind back home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>They're seated at a table with someone they love. Just thinking that brings peace to my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I want to protect times like these. For that reason, I fight the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Those you left behind back home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hehe, even I have a little history too, you know? Oh! Let me bring you your seconds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>My everyday life...</td>
