<td>He's coming at me, even with 0% chance of escape. I truly cannot comprehend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I suppose so. That's because you're limited by your calculations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ugh! I-is this... alchemic energy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My bad! I suppose that's the real trump up my sleeve. We're blasting through, my Lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ghhuhhgee...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Allie!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh?! Aaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Tsk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Geez... things never turn out as planned, do they? Whooooaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ugh! Grab my hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Seeing how you risk your life to save this one, I suppose he must be very precious to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No need to apologize. We just need to come up with a way to land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh? Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Uhh...<br>What is this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The Door of Truth, where souls are judged. My name is Ouroboros. I am the bond between truth and the world, the Observer of Destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The Observer of Destiny huh?<br>Heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What's so funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well... if an adorable little lady like you is the Observer of Destiny...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I suppose I wouldn't mind starting to believe in destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Who are you? I heard the frightened scream of a girl. So why are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh, I see...! Fiona's scream! Hey, what is this place? Is the girl alright?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I see. Your wish to save this girl must have surpassed the voice of her soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's an exceptional case, but let's say you do have the right to possess Power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Power? I'm sorry, but I never accept gifts from strangers for no reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hm? Are you saying you don't need it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I do think it would be way too ruthless if the girl lost her life here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If there's a way at all to save her, I'd like to ask you for even just a little of your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So, you want Power in order to save her? We could consider that a Soul Bond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Let me just ask you one question. Are you another one of those who's after the Sacred Stones?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Sacred Stones?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Are you talking about Belphegor, the Sacred Stone of Slothstein? Well, I can't say it means nothing to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Let me tell you then. That the breath which gave life to Belphegor will very soon be exhausted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Exhausted? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Just like I said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Very soon, the Stone will be no more... to be born again someplace else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>If you're after the Power of the Stone, your efforts may prove fruitless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I see... I suppose I'll be watching Belphegor's last moments then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You really are an odd person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...Very well then! Your contract with truth has hereby been concluded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>May you guide the unwavering Truth with your Willpower!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Eek!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh man... still in the same situation huh? Anyway, I'm back, my Lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>W-what are you talking about?!<br>Eek!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Don't panic. Stay calm and observe. Haven't you noticed anything different that can get us out of here? There must be something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Anything different?!<br>Wait a second, now you mention it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Did you find anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Your bike looks different! Is that... going to save us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Come on, Observer of Destiny, is customizing my bike going to get us a safe landing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oh no! We're almost...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Tsk! Give me a break! There's no way I'm going to die like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Whoa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huh?! What? We're alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I was almost getting scared! Anyway, the die is cast. Hold on tight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Huh? Eeek!</td>
</tr>
