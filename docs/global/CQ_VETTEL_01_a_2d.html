<td>Oh! It's Captain Vettel! We are truly grateful for your protection!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Thank you. We'll do our best not to lose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>With you here, Captain Vettel, you add the strength of 100 men!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Right. Let's do our best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Captain Vettel is so lovely! Wha...eeek?! A-a bee! There's a bee flying about! Someone...Captain Vettel, please drive it away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>M-my apologies...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Right now, there are soldiers calling to me over there, so I must hurry. You there, please take care of this young lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Understood, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ohhh, Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Phew. Jeez.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's one of the only things I can't handle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ah, if it isn't Captain Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Dilga...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Is something the matter? You look pale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh, no, I'm all right. Please do not bother yourself with me. I am just a little tired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hmm. I guess even Captain Vettel can accumulate fatigue after such a rigorous regiment. Please do take care of yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're right. It's not good to push oneself too hard. We must keep our body and mind sound in order to protect the people when it becomes necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well said, Captain Vettel. I have nothing to add to your words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>However, if you ever need someone to talk to, don't hesitate to tell me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>My offer extends to outside of the battlefield as well. Age is the one thing I have an advantage over you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Thank you, Dilga. I'll keep that in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>See you on the battlefield then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Dilga is quite reliable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But that's one thing that I can't discuss with him...</td>
