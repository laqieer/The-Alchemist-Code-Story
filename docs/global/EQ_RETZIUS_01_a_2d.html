<td>002</td>
<td>Retzius? What's the matter? You've been absentminded recently. Did something happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Nothing's happened! That's the problem! Argh! I can't stand it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I see. So your uncharacteristic silence...was merely you racking your brain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I wonder if this is what I'm supposed to make of my life. Am I supposed to live out my days as a thief?! In order to survive, perhaps I have no other choice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But I want to live more passionately! I want to burn brighter! Do you understand what I mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well, I'd be lying if I said I didn't, but...please, hang in there. That mindset of yours will get in the way of our work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah. I know! I'll do my job properly. Um...was it around here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes. It's that house we can see over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Those unscrupulous merchants have been attempting to monopolize the oases around here... They're real hoarders, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Are you really all right on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yeah. The rest of you guard the area and ensure our escape route. We're getting out of here as soon as the robbery is complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It all comes down to the when the sun sets. All right, let's pull this off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...Tsk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why are there so many guards?! This is news to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hmph. Well, well. Look what the cat dragged in. You're a rather scrawny looking rat, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>How dare you...! I'm not scrawny! I have the glorious name of Retzius...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And now you've given up your name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Darn it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What an overconfident piece of trash. Take him out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What...who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Argh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I will now be seizing all the possessions of this household. You, more than anyone, know the reason for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Uck... Who...are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>My name is of little consequence. What is of consequence is what I was hired to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Wo...wow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...Um!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Um...thank you for...well...saving me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I don't recall saving you. I fulfilled my mission. That is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...! Still, thank you! My name is Retzius. What's yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>My name is of little consequence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, um, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Those who allow their circumstances to limit them will end up dead. That is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...He...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...Is so...cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You really had me scared there, Retzius. We thought you were done for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hmph. You idiots. That was a piece of cake for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Um...Retzius...I've been wondering about this for a while, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Well...that overconfident attitude doesn't really suit you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>....Oh, really? I guess I've got a long way until I reach that bro's level! His coolness was unreal...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That bro...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>How can I say it...? It was like he was exuding masculine confidence! "My name is of little consequence"...hah! A man amongst men!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>All right, I've made my decision! I'm gonna become that man's disciple! As of today, our band of thieves is disbanded!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Whaaat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I've finally discovered the way of life for me! I'll become a man amongst men! Just you wait, bro!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...But how are you going find someone whose name you don't even know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yeah, that's the catch...hmm... Hey, do you have any ideas?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You've put me on the spot, but...oh, that's right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I've heard about a fortuneteller in Lustburg who is always accurate! That being said, they're only rumors, so I'm not sure how much weight they hold...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's it! Thanks! All right, hold on, bro!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hey, wait...! Retzius!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Thanks for everything until now! Stay healthy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...I've never seen Retzius so excited about anything before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Good luck, Retzius!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Phew. All right, I've finally arrived. Now, where's the fortuneteller's house...? Ack...there's no one to ask anyone this late at night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>(...Wait. What is that girl doing out alone in the middle of the night?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>(What is she doing? Is there something up there in the sky? Anyway, I'll ask her about the fortuneteller.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hey...hold on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Well, well. You really shouldn't be walking around alone this late at night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Tsk. What timing. Actually, I can get some directions!</td>
