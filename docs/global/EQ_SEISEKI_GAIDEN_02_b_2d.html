<td>There!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Seida, behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Seida, get down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Seida, are you alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Mission accomplished. We are victorious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Getting so excited about suppressing the resistance... He really isn't efficient at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Lord Zain, thank you for your assistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I did nothing. It is Monzein you should thank.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Mmm... That may be true, but he's so reckless. It really is dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yet that fire of his will sustain the Holy Guard. Perhaps it will even help to save the entire world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but I simply don't agree. I think that fire of his may even bring danger down upon us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He has you, Seida. I believe I have said that you would make a good pair, have I not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You have fire in you, too. I think the day will come when you will accept one another... Don't you agree, Zain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yes. I, for one, feel safer knowing that we have young people like you around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Thank you, Lord Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>All right! You did well, knights! Let's have a drink to celebrate the success of the mission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's my treat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Not again... Lady Kaya, please say something to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The Vice-Captain doesn't have the money to treat the knights like this, but he always does anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Heheh, but that's just the way he is. It's not such a bad thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What are you doing, Seida?! You're coming, too! Today we drink from dusk till dawn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Haa... Well, Lady Kaya, Lord Zain... I suppose I shall take my leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, that was interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It was. The seedlings are beginning to grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's why I thought it was a fine time for me to retire... What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I was just thinking... This may be a relatively peaceful time, but the Holy Guard is still very much needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I did say that I would step down as Captain and investigate by myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No. There are things that I must understand as Lord Commander. Let us hurry.</td>
