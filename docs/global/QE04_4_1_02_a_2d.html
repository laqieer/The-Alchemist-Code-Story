<td>There are so many of them! Why would the dragon's body be discharging all this Jam?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Could ingesting Beelzebub be the cause?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hmph. Did you fail in retrieving Beelzebub, Georgios?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No, I am simply putting my original plan into motion. Your elaborate schemes aren't necessary anymore to take back what's mine. I will slay the dragon and take Beelzebub by force!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Georgios! How could you kill Asena?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Bwahahaha! I have no interest in the likes of you. Wind Shaman, your enemy is that thing over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Gah! What sheer power! Are you saying that you think you have what it takes to kill it, Georgios?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If not, then let me die in the attempt. I confront every foe with the same resolve. The dragon shall fall by this blade of mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That sword... Don't tell me you're...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Aye. I am from that clan. We, who have trained and honed our art for generations, perfecting it for the sole purpose of slaying dragons! Allow me to demonstrate our craft!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Behold, the sword passed down in my clan from generation to generation: the Dragonslayer! Here I come, dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>HRAAAAAAAARH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>He's managed to wound the dragon! What in the world is that weapon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>One of the reasons I chose to ally with Georgios was this: his Dragonslayer. He alone holds the power to face the dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>WRAAAAAAAAAGH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Georgios!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hahahahaha! I can slice into its body, but not through its bones! No matter. Being able to make such a cut means...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's mortal! Time to make this thing comprehend that it is beneath me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Georgios! We are not here for your amusement. Have you forgotten what we're here for?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Tch, I admit I did get a bit carried away, but it seems my blade can't reach its core. Tehre, have you come up with another of your schemes yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Its core?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Dragons are living organisms, too. Destroying their core will kill them, just like any other being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>However, it is far larger than I expected. In order to destroy its coreâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We will need to do it from inside its body. Reaching its core from here would be an impossible feat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The only way to enter its body would be through its mouth, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But it's too high up, and we'd have to worry about it trying to scorch us with its flames.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Then, is there another way? If we don't find another way, Saga is finished!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Getting rid of these should take priority.</td>
