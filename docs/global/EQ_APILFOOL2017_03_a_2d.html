<td>Hi, soldier! Good day to you too!</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>I heard recently you're feeling kind of down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah, well...a little.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Come on man. You're a monster but you have the ability to talk. Take advantage and go off on a rant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It means a lot to hear you say that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But it's just you, you know? You're the only Lizardman that can talk.</td>

<td>I know, but...it seems to be the effect of the Alchemia.</td>

<td>Well, do you speak with humans as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Nah, can't do that! Man! That's asking a lot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But don't you hear about how they're always saying, "You should talk with us!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Nah, man! Can't do that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I mean, when you used to be human, if a Lizardman suddenly tried to start a conversation with you, you'd either kill it or run away, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>See?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You know...sorry. If you want I'll get you something on the way home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Nah, I'm really okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>All right, let's go!</td>

<tr>

<td>Let's!</td>
