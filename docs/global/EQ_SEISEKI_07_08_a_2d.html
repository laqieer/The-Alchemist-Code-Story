<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>So, how did you feel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>About what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>About speaking with the Lion Monarch Orion. You snuck in to ascertain his way of thinking, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I gained a lot from it. Apparently, I have the potential to gain even more power than I have now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>More power than you have now? Is that what you're seeking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If Zain's ideology still exists amongst the others of the Holy Guard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The tragedy he endured will repeat itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I must do everything I can to stop that violence from occurring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And you need power to do so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes. I wasn't able to stop him or to open the eyes of my comrades who were being used by him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No...in fact...if he had the power to destroy the Mikaboshi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm sure he wouldn't have thought of using Zain and Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Are you saying that everything occurred due to your lack of power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Right now I'm too vulnerable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>In order to protect this world and to save my comrades...I must obtain even more power than I have now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>However...if you seek more power than that which you can contain...you will fall to the darkness. That man Fung Liu warned you about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That'll probably be the case if one were to solely pursue power. However, I have determination on my side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This determination will protect me at all costs from being consumed by the darkness...as long as I have something I need to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Kagura, huh? But don't you think she shares the same ideals as Zain along with the other captains?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's not a problem. Kagura and I have a deep bond from having lived together. She's just been a little confused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hmph. It seems like you've got everything figured out now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Zain was in the position of "supreme judge". He was supposed to govern the equilibrium of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yet, he attempted to extend his grasp to the Alchemy of Power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What that man was attempting...ultimately, it wasn't a mistake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What do you mean by "supreme judge"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm talking about someone who observes the equilibrium that balances this world's power. Without such an individual right now, this world is in an extremely dangerous situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>In order to save this world...I need to quickly obtain this power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Wait, you're not telling me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Under normal circumstances, the current Lord Commander, Kanon, should be the one to succeed to the position of "supreme judge". However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>With the Corpse having infiltrated the Holy Guard, I cannot leave this position to them. I must instead fill the role.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I will take the position of "supreme judge"...and defend the equilibrium of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's the responsibility I should take as the one who killed Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Wh-why would you say something so outrageous...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I don't intend for you to understand what I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Seriously. Your thinking surpasses my own limits time and time again. Look, we're in view of it now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...So that's it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes. That's Ramproad Mountain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Monzein the Great Thunder Axe; Seida the Hurricane Arrow...and Kagura the Law of Hellfire...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Even if they can be taken on individually...if they team-up together, it'll be a hassle to deal with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>In order to ensure I can obtain the Holy Sword Excalibur, I should wait until we're alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It'll be a bit of a hassle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It seems like you were scolded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I was told that I shouldn't hire some random guy as my bodyguard. He won't even listen to what I have to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Seriously. Why are you such a hassle all the time? Fine. I'll go talk to Captain Monzein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Lord Commander Kanon...we're finally alone now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Are you gonna tell me that you were waiting for this moment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I knew I was right! You're here to assassinate Lord Commander Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Little frog...did you come back here all alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yeah? So what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Well...instead of waiting for the captains to be away...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'm thinking it'll be a better idea to use this opportunity to defeat you first and complete my mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>So you've finally shown your true colors! Fine! Let's settle it here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'm pretty sure I warned you already. Your enthusiasm alone won't make you victorious over me. I'm sorry, but I won't hold back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ughh...?! Lo-Lord Commander Kanon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What are you doing, Basheeny? Now isn't the time for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>My apologies. I was careless. You've gotten in my way, little frog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Lord Commander Kanon, please be careful! That man...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Huh?! Why are you pointing your sword at me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Victor, even if you're Chloe's junior...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>If you're going to hurt Basheeny, I won't stand by silently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>N-no, there's been a misunderstanding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>This scum is an assassin! His aim is to steal Excalibur from you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You mean his aim "was", right? He's now a Paladin, just like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Exactly what I said. No matter what your original mission was for getting close to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Right now, you're no longer capable of enacting it, Basheeny. You're one of us now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...! Are you saying that you knew what my intent was all along?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Who knows? In any case...right now your mission is to protect me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Jeez...that's pretty cruel. So you were toying with me all this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>It doesn't matter how you perceive it. Just rest assure that I trust in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Huh? How can you even say that knowing what you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I'm somewhat aware of the fact you're dealing with a lot of issues right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>But...there's no way that I can see you as a bad person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I just think you didn't have anyone in your life that you could call your friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Friend...? Haha! I have no need of such a thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It's not about whether you need one or not. In any case...you're no longer alone. You have us now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You're kidding with me, right? If you are, it's really not that funny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I'm being serious of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>We've already been bound together as friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but I won't fall for those words. If you wish to maintain that facade, then by all means do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Ack! You're not getting away with this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Lord Commander Kanon! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I'll tell you this once again. If you intend to harm him, I won't stand by idly. Put down your sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What are you thinking? I'm a spy and you're my target.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I don't care about your past. I'm talking to you directly...the person who is standing in front of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>...! You're looking at me directly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Kanon!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Captain Monzein?! Ah...please calm down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>What are you saying?! Hurry to the summit! You need to quickly rendezvous with Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I can feel the dark presence approaching! Most likely, it's Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I'll confront him first! You take them and head to the summit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Don't worry. If we end up engaging in conflict...the two of us should be able to suppress him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>In any case, you protect Kagura and these two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>All right. Captain Monzein...I leave it to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Got it. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>...Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Those two were supposed to have been highly suspicious of me...and yet now they're telling you to protect me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>They feel the same as I do. Even if they say abusive things with their lips, in their hearts, they also think of you as a friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>What is wrong with all of you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>We're just normal people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>When you're with someone long enough, you learn to accept each other. That's what normal people do. Idiot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Come on. What are you doing? We need to hurry to the summit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>It's difficult to comprehend the way you guys think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>In any case, I'll go stop the bothersome intruders. We'll talk after that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Huh?! He-hey, wait...Basheeny?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I...didn't come here to be protected by the likes of you either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Lord Commander Kanon, please hurry to where Kagura is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Victor?! Seriously...what's wrong with both of you?!</td>
</tr>
