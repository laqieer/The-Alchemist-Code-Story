<td>Come now, Celis Crowley. You shouldn't be surprised. Don't you think I know the identities of everyone in the Blade Fox Corps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why, though? How? How do you know all this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It just took the smallest bit of research. Information like that is hard to hide, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I thought perhaps you may know something about the lost Kagutsuchi, if for no other reason than because of your royal lineage in the house of the Rising Ashes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>......</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What are you planning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What would you do if I told you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If you intend to make an enemy out of Wadatsumi...I'll cut you down where you stand, without a second thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's curiosity. Nothing more. I just want to know the whereabouts of the lost Kagutsuchi. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I already told you I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>How unfortunate. Though, I thought you might say that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I was willing to keep you alive if you had any information for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But since you don't, I guess you'll just have to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Fragments of the Discarnate Power? How can a human control them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What you've seen heretofore were merely incomplete, experimental byproducts lent to us by the Discarnate Power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Field tests, if you will; samples to perfect the process. And perfect it, we did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We've finally reached the phase where a demon host can understand and execute human commands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>With the strength of a demon and a body that can't die, I'd say they make rather formidable weapons, wouldn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Weapons?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes. And you should feel honored! You get to be a hand-picked test subject for them, to help calibrate them properly. It will be your final legacy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So... Let the games begin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Uggrraaah!</td>
