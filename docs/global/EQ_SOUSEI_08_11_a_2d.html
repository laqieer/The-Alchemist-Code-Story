<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Well... Since Quence has gone out to face the opposition, I should go as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wait, Ignacio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>When you said that Emmel is just stalling for time, what did you...or, rather, why did you say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well... I said it because it's true. I had no ulterior motives in pointing it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Okay. But I think humans need that extra time, if only just so they can figure out what the right thing to do is from their perspective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>How about you? What do you think about that? Still not convinced?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well... I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>There it is again! When did you start doing that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Doing what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>When did you start having to think about your answers like that? You preface everything with "Well, I," and choose your words so carefully now. You never used to do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We— I-I mean, I dunno! It's been so long, I forget!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(I'm sorry, Helene, but I'm not an ally to Emmel. I don't think I ever will be.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Listen well, my son. We are but the shadows. We are the evil that sows chaos amongst the living. We are but a pack of zombies that hungrily devour the flesh of those who cross our paths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You must protect the true Nimul—the Child of God. Take the suffering and misfortunes that fall upon him unto yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Our savior has already resolved himself to save the world. In return, you must dirty your hands...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Even if the savior himself despises you for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Nimul. Child of God. You say you wish to save all the people of the world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But there are some who simply cannot be saved. Even if their bodies may yet live, their hearts—their souls—will perish. And most of them have chosen this fate for themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>They've chosen to live solely that the world may one day be reborn...and saved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yet through your actions, you seek to rip this choice away from them. To deprive them of it...to deprive us of it! Can you even fathom how devastating that is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's a bit more of an entrance than I was expecting to make...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It certainly wasn't subtle. I hope those four haven't dragged any civilians into this mess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It did make for an excellent diversion, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What's up next, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Given how loud that was, we should assume that they more or less know exactly what we're up to now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>And based on what Quence said, it seems clear he wanted to keep us from coming into contact with Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So we're going to be running into more literal roadblocks, then, most likely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Exactly. That's why I think we should split into two groups here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You want to split our forces even more?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I know we're stronger as a team, but our movements are much easier to track. We can be more covert with smaller numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Eulalia and I will head west. Yna, Adaleigh, and Waginau, you three head east.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Roger! I've actually been analyzing the stealth magitek the people from Ire Belt were using.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It might not be able to block sounds, but it can at least make us invisible to the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Is it really all right for me to go with Adaleigh, and not you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I have a general idea of this structure's layout. I think I can more or less serve as a guide. That could help you find her faster, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Your knowledge would better suit them than me. It'll help keep them out of trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Is that all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Let's do this, you old dog!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Can you not call me that, please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Haha. Been a while, hasn't it? Kind of makes me nostalgic for the good old days!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It has been a while. But I am neither old nor a dog, so let's not have any more trips down that particular memory lane!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>For my part, I think the division Nimul suggested is well reasoned. I'm skilled in subterfuge magic, so I can help keep him concealed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Waginau? Is something bothering you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No. I'm fine with this arrangement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Good. Then let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Okay, something's definitely up. You've haven't said a word since we split up with Nimul! What's going on, Waginau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I just feel a bit uneasy, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>About what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>About what that man said—Shahel, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Emmel? Come to stop us? Don't be absurd!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I had a feeling you wouldn't believe me, even though I speak the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What would be the point of us fighting? What would it accomplish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Our journey nears its end. We have defeated many Cursed Beasts and freed many Belt Regions already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>The future is within our grasp now. A future where everyone can be saved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>There's nothing further that Emmel needs to bear responsibility for, yet you're saying that—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Tell me, how exactly do you plan on saving the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You've felled six of the seven Cursed Beasts and come all this way, yet you still have no plan for sealing the deal. The part where you actually save people is one big question mark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>All you've been doing is going around mindlessly flaunting your power whenever you see people or circumstances you deem worthy of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Will you use your Alchemy to purify the corruption, perhaps? Or to cleanse the world of sin magil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Can you even do either of those things with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Her ambition in all of this is to give you time to realize yours, Nimul. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>She believes so strongly that you'll find a way to achieve your goal, she's willing to sacrifice herself for it. She's fought so hard to stay alive just so she can give you that opportunity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>But, that's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>No... No. These are all empty claims. You have no evidence to back up these lies of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>See for yourself, then. My Castle Hierosolyma stands before you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I presume even you cannot dispute what your own eyes show you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Fine, then. I'll call your bluff!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Nimul completely bought into his words. But I still feel this is nothing more than a trap, or some other form of deception. We must remain vigila—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Waginau! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Adaleigh, I thought our forms were supposed to be completely concealed?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>We should be invisible to them! But that shot sure wasn't off by much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I'm afraid we've inherited all of our comrade Icona's techniques.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>And according to her, magic is something that everyone should be able to use here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>So of course, it's only natural that we would familiarize ourselves with powers of disguise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Waginau. Adaleigh. This is as far as you go. I'm afraid neither of you have the proper ticket for the show that awaits beyond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Are you saying...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>It's just as I feared. This was all a trap to lure Nimul in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>That fool's sister is his weak point. His over-protectiveness will be his undoing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>We received a tip that, should Father bring her up in conversation with Nimul, it would almost certainly cloud his judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>So you did lie to us! Is she even here?! Certainly, she hasn't taken over this land as you said!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>She is here, and she has indeed taken control. I assure you, none of the information presented was untruthful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>She bested my father and became the rightful heir to this land. But of course, that doesn't mean she has control over the will of the people who live here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>And that will is where my heart lay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ignacio. You addressed Waginau and Adaleigh, but you left me out. That can't have been an oversight. What have you got up your sleeve?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Yna Ku. I'd like to offer you a choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Will you rejoin the Infinite Serpent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>The Ceremony of Creation is close at hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>No matter how hard Emmel should try to stop it, nor how much Nimul should scrabble to find a path forward, there remains only one way to save this world, and the Ceremony is it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>...Are you out of your mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>What are you trying to accomplish here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Yna, you were never able to let down your guard with us, were you? You learned our techniques, and our intelligence...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>But in the end, you left Superbia Belt without discovering our true intentions. Though you should be well aware of them now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>And so you must know that this is the only way to save the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Sorry to say, my outlook on the world is nowhere near as bleak as the Infinite Serpent's. I'm convinced there's another way forward for us; we just haven't found it yet. But it's there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Pity. I'd heard you were more of a realist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I am. But I've also made new friends and discovered the joy of pursuing one's dreams. And that's what won me over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>What a shame. I truly thought we might be able to see eye-to-eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Well, don't blame me for not fitting into your delusions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Oh, my! I'd heard the smiths of Avaritia Belt were well-practiced in the way of the sword, but I had no idea just how wily you lot were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>How were you able to dodge that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Quence showed me that same technique before. And given how frighteningly quick on the draw those who can use it are, I was naturally keeping myself at attention for just such an attempt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Grrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>What are you planning to do with Nimul and Emmel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Nothing in particular. I simply intend to encourage him to make a choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>A choice, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Nimul has the right to decide the future, but his time to make that decision is quite limited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>And if there must be a limit, would it not be preferable to extend it as much as possible, so he can weigh his options more carefully?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Even, of course, if more time means more suffering for us all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>The only thing I'm getting from all of this is that you're our enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Exactly so. I must stall you here until those two siblings come to a proper conclusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I'm afraid no matter how hard I try, I can't see the value in that course of action. Our ways of thinking are just too far apart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>In other words... Get out of our way, or we'll get you out of our way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Very well, then. If it's a fight you're looking for...!</td>
</tr>
