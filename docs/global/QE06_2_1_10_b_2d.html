<td>…Nghh…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh! You're awake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I keep telling you to take it easy… How are you feeling this morning, Sleeping Demoness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>…Don't call me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yeah, that wasn't my best. How about Rampaging Demoness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>..!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Time out! Time out! Just calm down. Deep breaths. Deep breaths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It'd be a shame if you went berserk on me now. The food's almost ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>On today's menu, we have wolf meat in sweet vinegar sauce! Here, have a bite!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What's wrong? Hurry before it gets cold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The thought of eating human food--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I thought you'd say that! Lucky for you, this isn't just for humans. It's perfectly edible for demons, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's not the point…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're right! It's not just that demons can eat it. It also comes with a flavor guarantee!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well…to be honest, you're the first demon to try it, so "guarantee" might not be the right word!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Would you just…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes, indeedy! You're the perfect demon to try it! Ahh! I'm so excited!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Listen to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Of course we can talk all you want after you eat! Chefs can't help wanting to improve their dishes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I kinda forced fed you earlier, but I need to know what you think about the flavor. Here, just try some.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>…Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Did you just say you force fed me…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, yeah! You kinda flew off the handle, so I had to do something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>A demon's survival instinct is pretty amazing. Once you had some food in your mouth, you just swallowed it automatically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You must've had that outburst because you were hungry. You calmed down once you had some food, and then you lost consciousness… You sure gave me rough time--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>…! And I ate it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Sure did! It's the fruit of my labor. I've always wanted a demon to try my food. I never expected I get the chance this soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I mean, I could have done without the rampaging, but all's well that ends well, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You're lying! I'd never eat something a human--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's the truth. You calmed down after you ate it. That's the only reason this place is still standing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I've got some cleaning up to do later, but--c'est la vie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>…That's…impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Demons only devour humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Most demons, maybe. But not you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You can try to deny it, but your body is screaming, "I want to live!" Besides…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Who says demons only eat humans, anyway? I bet it was someone who never tried anything different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What's the point in trying different things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>"Eat to live, not live to eat."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>In other words, only eat what you need to survive… If you don't eat something now, you'll die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Chefs don't just cook food, they provide nourishment! So, go on. Take a bite!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I don't need to hear this nonsense!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Quit acting tough--you can hardly move. You don't scare me at all. Besides…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You're irritable because you're hungry. I bet you won't feel like fighting on a full stomach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That's the key to peace. Humans and demons won't need to fight if everybody is fed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Are you...out of your mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Nope. Quite sane. Go on, before it gets cold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>…I'd rather not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>…*Sigh* Guess we're doing this the hard way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…Don't come near me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Be careful or you'll faint again, Sleeping Demoness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I told you not to call me that!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Don't make me do any more heavy lifting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'm not even that heavy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Please don't go berserk again, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I don't have control over it… But it's a necessary instinct. At least I think it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I'm not evil. The people who stole from me are the evil ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I'm not trying to take anything away from you. So, just eat up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You've got to live in order to see your brother again--to keep your promise, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>…Even if that means killing you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>If you want to devour me, go ahead. I don't plan on dying that easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Made up your mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>…I don't know how--to eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>…Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Bwahahahaha! That's right! I guess this is the first time you've ever seen something like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>…Don't laugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Sorry, sorry. That was rude. Open up! I'll feed you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You're joking…?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>It's fine. Ready? Here comes the airplane!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>..Wait--Oof!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>…!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Don't spit it out! Chew carefully. Savor it. And swallow it in one gulp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Don't fight your body's cravings. It wants to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>…!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>How is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>…I think…I ate it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Of course you did! You think I'd make something you couldn't eat? Tell me how it tastes already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>…Hmm, I don't…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Tell me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>…I don't know. It's the first time I've tried something like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Damn! And I was sure you'd like it… What can I add to make it better?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>…H-Hang on! I just told you this is all new to me. You can't expect me to describe it all of a sudden…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>If it were really good, you just say, "That was delicious!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>It doesn't matter whether you've tried it before. Here, have another bite!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>And let me know your thoughts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Easy for you to say! Wait! Give me some space--!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>And?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Back up, already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Attagirl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>…Don't expect any thanks… But I feel a little better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>…That's good enough for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>See, you can show gratitude after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>That wasn't gratitude. It's just--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Next time you lose your strength because of hunger, stop by and I'll make you something even tastier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Are you crazy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Crazy for cooking, maybe! Y'know, watching you eat I thought--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>You might not have said the word "delicious" but you sure looked like you enjoyed it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Your face said it all, even if your words didn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I hope to see that face again. And next time, I'll make something so delectable you'll have no choice but to say "De--licious!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Don't hold your breath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I'll make you eat those words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>…So long. May we never meet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>...We will. I'm sure of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Next time, I'll make your taste buds jump for joy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Now then, how can I get her to say "delicious?" Maybe more salt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>What's that intoxicating aroma I smell?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>..Oh, it's you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Is that any way to address a member of the Wadatsumi royal family? You're as ill-mannered as always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I should expect as much from a man who spends his days cooking in a place like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Let's cut to the chase… What do you want? I doubt you're here for a meal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Shrewd as ever--I like that. Let me be blunt--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Koga… I've come here to make a request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Will you join the Phoenix Brigade?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
