<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>If you're awake, go--they're still fighting atop the cliffs. You mustn't be found here…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>…I guess this means my pupils lost. What a disgraceful end for their instructor…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's not over yet. Your troops regained their position. Now's your chance to join them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I often lose sight of what's important when I focus too hard on my goals…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Lamia, I had forgotten about you for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…Priscilla</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It was after I went to study martial arts in your country--before the war broke out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That was when I learned of what happened to my trainees. How they were wiped out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The ones who managed to escape told me…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...about a spearwoman adorned with poppies who led the Wratharis army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>They said you had mercy on those who fled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I have no intention of fleeing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>…Don't say that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Will you kill me like you killed them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>…You're my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But I guess that's just an excuse…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>…Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I could kill them because they didn't mean anything to me. But you... It's selfish--contradictory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Like admiring a beautiful flower, but then tearing it from the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I've taken countless lives before, but I hesitate when it's someone I know. Always…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What are those?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>…Flowers to place on their graves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…White flowers. Gardenias?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes, for my pupils--gardenias of fleeting beauty to mourn the dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You taught me that, Lamia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...I miss those days. Everything was lighthearted and carefree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Tell me. Do you hate war?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Don't we all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I yearn for it. It's the only chance I can prove who I am…without the need for words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes, I remember you feeling that way back then, too--every time we crossed spears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I could say the same for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No, not me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>When your blood boils, your back--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>…Look away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>All the Alchemia in your body causes the wing-shaped marks on your back to glow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>They speak volumes without you needing to say a word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>…Those days are over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>…Truthfully, I hate war, too. The fighting exhilarates me, but the deaths of my comrades--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's a paradox I still can't figure out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...I know how you feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That's why I want to teach--to show my students how to wield power in order to avoid conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>…How to...wield power…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You've got to forgive yourself for wanting to protect certain people and not others…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Otherwise, you're just beating yourself up for no reason. There's enough negativity in war as it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You've got to learn to love yourself. I'm sure someday...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You'll be glad you did. But who knows when that day will come…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>…Priscilla</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>…. As you can see, lectures aren't my strong suit. I take too long to get to the point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>…Teach me, Priscilla.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What is there for me to teach you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I'm not sure how to "wield power," as you put it. But being with you like old times…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You want me to be your...instructor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I don't know… That doesn't sound quite right…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Then how about "friend?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>…Yes, "friend." That's the word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yeah. I hope that's possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Miss Priscilla! Are you alright? Please let us know that you're safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>My troops. They must have come looking for me. There's nowhere to hide on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Priscilla…I…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Go! You and I never met.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Imagine the instructor AND her pupils losing to you. How could I ever show my face? Just go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>…I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Someday when the war is over…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yeah…you'll teach me more about flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>…Farewell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Farewell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>But the war isn't over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Enemy sighted! She's below the cliffs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Out of my way!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>If I let you go, my students--my friends--will be killed. I'm certain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I know I'll regret it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>We've got the Wratharis soldiers cornered. Face it! You're done for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>(I must live.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>(Until the day I can learn to love myself)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>(I know I can learn…and then, I'll meet that special someone--)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>The flowers I carry have yet to bloom.</td>
