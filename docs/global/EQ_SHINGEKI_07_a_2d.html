<td>Reiner...? It's you, isn't it? If it is, then please...! Please stop! I hate this! I hate this so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That is why we must get back to our world as quickly as possible. Without us, it's defenseless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You...! You sound just like my dad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>There! Take this! Quad-Assault!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Haaaa... Haaaaa... Dangit all... This is tough, alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No! I-it's really him. That...really is Reiner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I can't believe it... A human that can turn into a Titan? That's crazy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Heh. It's crazy to us that a human can fight a Titan like that without using omni-directional mobility gear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Listen up, Reiner! If you threaten the safety of this continent, then I will have to cut you down! And I won't be going easy on you, either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I won't let you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Come on, Judith. Get out of the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I owe him my life, and you are my enemy! Need I say more?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I won't let you touch him either, Levi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If you make a move, I... I won't fix your ODM gear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I can't just let him go! He's a danger to Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's what you always tell yourselves, isn't it? If something looks even a little dangerous, or if it's taboo, you put it down, even if it's not doing anything bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>How can you call that justice?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but if something even has the slightest chance of endangering Babel, I will eliminate it, no matter how small the danger may seem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We lost too much during the Lion Monarch's Charge. For the sake of our future, we... I...need to be more careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't expect you to understand. Your father's blood is on our hands, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yet so far as I can see, there's no reason for you to be protecting that Titan, so, please... Step aside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>He's not a Titan! He's Reiner! He has a name and everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Besides, it's like I told you: I owe him my life! I'm not going anywhere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Why are you being so stubborn? He's not even from our world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What does that have to do with anything?! He's here now! We've gotten to know each other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>He's just as human as you and me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Nnngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Get out of my way! I'm gonna save him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You idiot! Do you know what you're doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You may think you owe him your life, but he just tried to kill you! He's a Titan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Judith. Are you sure you want to do this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Even I don't know the right answer here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Just keep in mind that this is a big decision that will directly impact the future. Be sure not to make a choice that you'll regret, Judith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
