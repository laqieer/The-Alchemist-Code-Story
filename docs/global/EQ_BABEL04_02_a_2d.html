<td>002</td>
<td>Hmm, I suppose that will do for today. Let's leave the Demon Calming Ceremony there. That was good work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Lady Yomi, you did very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Why is it necessary for us to do this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's necessary in order to suppress the power that lurks within you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>All of Wadatsumi's people are descended from demons. Among them, one clan has a particularly strong lineage—and that is our clan, the Kagomurasaki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Demons used to devour humans. It is said that they did this in order to harvest their Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So that's why the Alchemia, or Chakra, in our bodies is like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power responds strongly to hatred. At present, the actions of one man are forcing all of Wadatsumi to face the hardship of invasion yet again.</td>

<td>Discarnate Power responds strongly to hatred. At present, the actions of one man are forcing all of Wadatsumi to face the hardship of invasion yet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>His intention is to make your emotions unstable, and thereby force your power to manifest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>For breaking his oath and spilling the blood of his blood, he is the enemy of all of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The invader, Jin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>J-Jin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>By the gods! Th-this demonic energy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This is proof that evil has been growing within you, Lady Yomi. That is why the Demon Calming Ceremony is necessary. Please understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's right. This may be uncomfortable, but it is for the sake of all Wadatsumi and the world at large.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power is the source of all corruption. Should it manifest, this world will be overrun by demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well then, Lady Yomi, you must be tired. Please return to your quarters and have a nice, long rest. We shall take care of the clean up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I don't see any of the soldiers from Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>They left several hours ago. We told them repeatedly that we have no intention of handing over Sumeragi or yourself, my lady. For the moment, we are safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes, you are far too young to take on such responsibilities, so they have been chased away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>She's gone. She couldn't possibly be aware of our plan, could she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm sure she has her suspicions, but I don't think it's possible that she knows everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>As for Sumeragi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I have relieved Lady Yomi of its care, and have stored it safely away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I told her that I was worried about her condition worsening, what with those soldiers from Greed Dike barging in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I will milk Lady Yomi's usefulness for all it is worth, until the very end...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yomi...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What? You have something to say? You already kicked us out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We haven't finished our discussion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, it was finished for us, thanks to those old geezers. I guess you can't expect to communicate with heathens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Heathens this, heathens that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We are taught that Wadatsumi is a heretical land, plagued by evil ideas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Evil ideas?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We are taught that it is a land of fanatical heathenism and savagery, a land where violence is used to encourage adherence to tradition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It is said that they will happily kill even their own blood for breaking tradition. Just like you are trying to do now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>How dare you! You're the savages who are all too happy to turn a blind eye to your past!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You took our country from us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The past won't change just because you make some pretty little speech about holding hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Who would happily kill their own blood?! No one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It is simply that what must be done will be so! They cannot be forgiven!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Otherwise we cannot move on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I have to kill that man. As the head of the Kagomurasaki Clan, in accordance with the oaths we have sworn, and for his crime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yet I cannot kill him if I don't hate him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That's just how it has to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Leafah, listen to me. It doesn't matter how many strong techniques you master—what's important is that you don't misuse them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It's meaningless if you only use them for the benefit of yourself and the country in which you were born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What? Then...for what purpose do you train?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I train so that I can lead this world into a peaceful future—so that I can create a world in which people can join hands and overcome their differences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Join hands...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It shouldn't matter which country you were born in, we're all people of Babel, right? I'm sure we can understand each other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>The world doesn't rule people. People create the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Their suffering, sorrow, ire, joy... These burdens overlap, and when they connect...that is how the world of humans is made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Leafah. When you lose your way, heed the voices of the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>If you do that, the answer you seek should come to you all on its own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hmph. So even now I cling to the words of she who sought a different kind of peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>N-nothing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>So...you have your own burden to bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Of course I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You live in Wadatsumi... I suppose it is obvious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Even though you're still so young...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I could say the same for you, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I'm not a child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Wha—? Huh? I didn't say that you were a—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Don't treat me like a child! I just have a baby face, so I look younger than I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Wh-what are you talking about all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>It's just my face! My face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Okay! I get it already! I didn't mean anything by it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You called me the Baby General, didn't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I did not! How would I even come up with something like "Baby General"?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Hey! I knew it! See, you just said it again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Wh-what is your problem?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Do you feel better now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I guess I...lost my composure for a second there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Obviously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I'm...sorry. Please forget everything that just happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>It seems that we both have burdens to bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I can understand why you wouldn't believe me, considering what Greed Dike did to Wadatsumi in the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>And I'm young—well, I look young—I mean it's just my fa—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Enough of that already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I'm not enough to gain the trust of the people both in and outside of Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>But you're the General, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>In name only.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I was appointed General as a symbolic gesture to mark the start of a new Greed Dike that is to be projected to the rest of the world. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>In name...? Symbolic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>At present, our nation is adopting the principle of transparency, and laying bare the sins of its past. We are working to atone for the mistakes we have made in order to earn back trust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>So they wanted a young person for the position of General, to emphasize the rebirth of Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Still, I can't stand not being taken seriously just because I'm young. Age doesn't matter when it comes to caring about your country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I was saved by the strength of this nation, and I was supported by its righteous justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>That's why it's us, the new generation, who want to restore faith in our proud nation as quickly as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I want to encourage the people who have lost faith in us, and bring smiles back to their faces. That's what drives me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I might be young, but I'll take on any and every responsibility in order to rebuild this great nation. It's us who will be in charge of the world from now on, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Even if we're ridiculed for being young. Even if we embarrass ourselves. It's still us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I won't try to force you to trust me. I just want you to understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>But I'm a heathen...right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I knew that there were people still troubled by the past, driven by their anger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I was ignorant, but I didn't try to understand or to learn. I just stood in your way. I realize that now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>For that, I am sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Grrrrrrraaaaaaaawwwwwwwwww!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Uhoh. We've been surrounded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>When did they—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Yomi, where is Sumeragi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I...I left it with the old-timer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>There's a lot of them... Think we can handle it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I rarely ever used Sumeragi in the first place. I'll be fine with just a short sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Let's call a brief truce and join forces. How about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I...still can't forgive you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I'm not at liberty to help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I-I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>That's why I need you to understand that this is just temporary...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>But you can trust me to watch your back for now!</td>
</tr>
