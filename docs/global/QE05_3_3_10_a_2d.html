<td>Here they come!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>To be frank, this is a gamble. Should we slip up, there will be no second chances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Nonetheless, this is the best hand we have to play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Everyone, listen up! We are now going to launch our attack on the enemy's main forces!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You must not fall behind! Know that should even one of you fall behind, this plan will fail!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's time! Forward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What?! They're charging out with their entire force?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Y-yes, sir! Not only that, but they're headed straight for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Desert scum! Have they lost all sense?! We outnumber them three to one! Crush them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>All right, they fell for it! Here they come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Keep that speed up! You must not slow down! "I beseech the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh? What's that light?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Urrggghhh... Aarrrrggghhhh! What are they doing?! I thought they were on our side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wh-what is the meaning of this?! King Ceclidis, whyâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's working! Ceclidis didn't intentionally set the Jam upon that city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>They were merely attacking whatever emitted the strongest Alchemia in the area along the army's march!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>All we needed to do was direct their incentive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That is what you get for shutting yourself up in your palace and failing to stand on the front lines with your troops, Ceclidis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We must make the most of this opportunity! Leave the Jam who come this way to Tina and the Fruit Peddlers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Logi! Take the Liberation Army and tear a hole in Gluttony's defenses while they're still reeling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Right! Leave it to me!</td>
