<td>Looks like there's an entrance there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The ruins here sure run deep. Think we should head in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The Constructs seem unlikely to engage us as long as we do not interfere with whatever they've been directed to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But I would not dismiss the possibility that there may be armed guards waiting within.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>After all, it's highly probable someone—our mysterious, magnanimous noble, most likely—is already one step ahead of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'd say we've been pretty lucky, catching the Constructs mid-transportation. We might not get another chance like this again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah, you're right. Everyone, look sharp. We're going in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Cold air permeates the hallway, a far cry from the humidity of the forest outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's pretty chilly in here... Wonder what's up with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This place looks like a maze...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hmm. There are a number of adjoining hallways to the entrance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Without the guidance of the Constructs, I'm afraid we'll be heading in blind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I wonder where they went. It's a little scary how quickly they've disappeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Mm... Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Soren? You don't look too well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Good work. Thank you for sending the results. I'll follow up later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(That voice... sounds really familiar...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ah, (...), Sector 2A requires your attention. Something has interfered with the processes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'll be over in a minute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The footsteps begin to recede somewhere to the left, followed by strange, mechanical ambient noises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(I didn't quite catch the name, but... Sector 2A?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Soren! Soren, can you hear me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh? Uh... Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You were clutching your head, and then you zoned right out. We thought you were going to pass out again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, my head doesn't hurt that much this time... I had a vision, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>A vision?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I heard voices. One of them was really familiar, and there was mention of a certain "Sector 2A."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I don't know why, but I think I know where that is. Or maybe where it used to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Soren walks to the intersecting hallways and points down the left side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I suppose my hypothesis about your amnesia is correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yeah... But I'm a little afraid of my past. What if I was a terrible person?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I doubt it. You might have lost your memory, but I don't believe that would affect your personality very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>A terrible person probably wouldn't care about animals or help kids in Slothstein sewers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You'll be fine, kiddo. But you have to tell us if your head hurts again, alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We're probably being watched, so we should tread carefully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Indeed. Let us proceed with caution.</td>
