<td>Us bad guys like to aim for the top though. There's such a nice view up there, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Why is your right arm like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This? This is for savin' the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Then why are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Because it's already too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I highly doubt that your urge to save the world just disappeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Of course not, but that's why I've brought you along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You're here as bait. If I defeat that perverted Alkaroid, then this city is mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Not only that, but I get riches and status to boot. Sorry for having to be the bad guy here, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I thought that the point of the mafia was not money or power, but moral obligation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah. What about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, you should reconsider what you're doing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Tell me somethin'. Where is the humanity in this city?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It definitely exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I can't give up this bad guy shtick now. There's no way anyone would accept a new mayor—and it's not like you could beat that retired piece of junk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Pathetic, ain't it? It's such a bad joke I can't even laugh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Intruder detected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hey, there. Aren't you supposed to be guarding this clock tower? You're a bit slow on the uptake, ain't ya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Time was needed to verify the data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You can't even do the job I gave you, stupid scrapheap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>W-wait a moment! The job you gave it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yeah, I was the one who told it to kidnap you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It was a real surprise when this piece of junk woke up in the clock tower basement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The people of this country would have a common enemy if this thing stole their mayor away. It'd give them a sense of fear and dread that couldn't be beat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It was just too good of a chance to pass up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You fell right into my trap, without a hitch—and you're not some tragic heroine, so don't even bother with the puppy dog eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>My objective has been updated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>My settings have been updated independent to prior directives. I will take the woman as my wife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I will begin the process of eliminating humanity after the issue of production is resolved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You...learned how to make kids?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Alvarez explained to us that our AI is far superior to the abilities of humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I am aware that anything a human can do, an Alkaroid can do better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You don't know nothin'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The possibility cannot be verified without experimentation. I will remove all barriers in my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Like what, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Don Taras</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Like you could win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I am the last guard of the clock tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I was the first model developed by Alvarez. My specifications were later improved to give me the ability to adapt to all situations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>My activation means that the reprieve that was given to humanity is over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I can find no reason not to remove all barriers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That's pretty conceited. There's a contradiction, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Contradiction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You're the one who said it, you rust bucket! You won't know unless you try!</td>
