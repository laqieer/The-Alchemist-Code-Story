<td>Fluffy! Fluffy is f-f-fraying.</td>

<td>Fluffy...?</td>

<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah, that's this stuffed animal's name. I just made it super cute, and now I have to fix it all over again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>C-cute?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes, cute! It's really soft, too! Don't you wanna touch it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh, erm... No, thank you. That aside, why are you carrying around a stuffed animal all of a sudden?</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ah, so then this stuffed animal is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's right! I want to keep growing, after all.</td>

<td>I'm sorry. There's something I need to do first.</td>
