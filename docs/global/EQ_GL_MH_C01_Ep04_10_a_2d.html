<td>Siegfried, you mentioned that you came across another such construct in a village in the Saga region...</td>

<td>For ease of reference, I am terming these creations "Alchemic Constructs". Or Constructs, for short.</td>

<td>Now... as we discovered prior, there were many other types and variations of what I believe are Alchemic Constructs.</td>

<td>If my hypothesis is correct, then we have much to be worried about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>And if there are other Constructs to be found as far as the Saga region, then we must consider the possibility that there may be more of these facilities across the world.</td>
</tr>

<td>If, indeed there is someone behind all this... their directive appears to be a most destructive one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
