<td>I wonder how many of us will pass this final test.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Who knows? Paladin hopefuls gather from all over Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The number of them is more than 1,000 a year. Amongst them, only a handful become Paladins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>True. There were a lot of Squires who weren't able to keep up and ended up quitting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm surprised you weren't one of them despite your inferior rank.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What?! You're making fun of me again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No, I'm not. I'm telling you that you've got guts. I mean that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Of course, talent is important for becoming a Paladin, but you also need incredible determination and mental strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Kanon, why did you want to become a Paladin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I...want to repay my debt to the Holy Order of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Repay your debt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yep. I was taken in and raised by the Holy Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's why I want to become a worthy knight and repay them with my gratitude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wow...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's why my dream is to become captain of the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There's no better way to show my gratitude than to become captain and protect the peace, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Captain, huh? That's a pretty big dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Why did you want to join the Holy Guard, Chloe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Because I'm a fan of Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What?! No, come on. I'm being serious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm serious, I'm totally freaking serious! My mom's a huge fan of Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...Your mom, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ever since I was a child, I grew up hearing stories about Captain Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Before I knew it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I found myself thinking, "When I grow up, I want to become a knight and meet Captain Vettel."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>So, I naturally enrolled in a knight training school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>There, I learned that I had more Alchemia Particles than most people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's when I decided I might as well become a Paladin since I have the potential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So, I joined our Paladin apprenticeship school!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The truth is, I wanted to join the Scarlet Flame Guard where Captain Vettel is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huh? What's the matter, Kanon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Argh! Just look at you, breezing through life with no effort!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I want to be a Paladin, but I'm in the 13th Rank!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I can't help it. This talent is something I was born with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Okay, wow! That sounds totally elitist and stuck-up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Fine! You do you; I'll do me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm gonna do whatever it takes to pass this thing! Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Why are you suddenly getting so worked up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Seriously! When are we gonna reach the Trial Ruins?!</td>
