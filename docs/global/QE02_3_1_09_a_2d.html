<td>003</td>
<td>More importantly...where did the young lady disappear to?</td>

<td>This railroad is a single track running along a cliff. There's nowhere to hide.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>... ...</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hey, what's this trail? Are these...hooves?</td>

<td>007</td>
<td>Hooves...?</td>

<td>Seriously...if you're gonna go on living in the underworld, you should at least recall past battles.</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?</td>

<td>The first battle we fought together...</td>

<td>Don't you remember how tough the fighting was in Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The Vunians? That equestrian race? A horse...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The well-trained horse can gallop up a cliff. Don't you remember how much they made us suffer?!</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Don! Bad news!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There's a massive amount of androids approaching from both the front and rear! We're trapped!</td>

<tr>
<td>019</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm saying that, with my graceful moves, I can easily handle this amount of androids. I'm saying that we won't be needing your help, Don.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...You're making me cry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Just remember that once we get back to the mansion, we're drinking that bottle of Bleu du Goward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Of course, Don.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>All right, men, brace yourselves! We're gonna plow our way through!</td>
</tr>

<td>Feel free to knock anyone who gets in your way off the cliff. Let's go!!!</td>
