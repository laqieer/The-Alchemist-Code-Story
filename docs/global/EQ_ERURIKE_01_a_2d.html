<td>001</td>
<td>I didn't expect things to end up like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You're too loud. Try to be more aware of your surroundings. If that ‘thing' were to find us here, we'd have nowhere to escape to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ack... I know, I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Seriously. I've picked up quite the handful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Thank you. You really helped me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I would prefer if you apologized instead of thanking me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We're gonna keep walking until the sun sets. Don't lag behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I know, I know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hey, Elrike! I just got back...whoa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What is this mess?! It's like a hurricane just blasted through this room!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, Elaine? You got back safely! Sorry. Hold on a second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I still haven't organized my luggage from when I went on my trip to Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. You really do like traveling, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You were just telling me the other day, when you came back from Slothstein, that you wouldn't travel for a while after being ridiculed and having your pockets picked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Now that's nothing more than a good memory. Traveling as a merchant is my life's passion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's a wonderful thing to experience the culture of a new place and then share their local food and traditional goods with other lands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So I guess I can't be stopped that easily. The same could be said about your work, Elaine. You won't quit, even when I tell you it's dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Being a mercenary is never a risk-free job, although I do I get your point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Anyway, I'm determined to show my little baby a lot of different places.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh! You mean your hat! You're still using it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Of course! She carries a lot of important memories with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>When I was a child, I was so weak I couldn't even play outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You used to go on all sorts of adventures with that hat and then come back to tell me about them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You have no idea how much that meant to a bed-ridden child like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's why there's no way I can get rid of this hat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Don't keep telling me that story. It makes me feel embarrassed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You don't have to be embarrassed! It's the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Besides...thanks in part to that, I was able to find my passion in life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I mean that I was happy trading my sweets for stories of your adventures, Elaine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I was so envious of you traveling around in that hat and looking for freedom and adventures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I remember begging you for the hat because I thought it would give me the strength to leap out of bed and go traveling as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ahahah. I remember that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You told me that you were willing to exchange it for something that you truly wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I searched desperately to find something you could value, Elaine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>When you finally agreed to exchange your hat for one that was dear to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I remember feeling so happy to see the smile on your face. It made me realize the pure joy of finding something that someone else values.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hehe. Well, it's true that no amount of money would've made me part with that. The only person that I've exchanged one of my hats with...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...is you, Elrike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Still, I'm surprised to see how someone as fragile as you has now become a trader who travels all across the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It makes me feel a little emotional.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Heheh. If you were to go by just distance alone, I've now journeyed much further than you, Elaine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>True. I wonder how that modest little highborn lady turned out like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm still a lovely lady! Also, I'm older than you so try to be more respectful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hmm. That's not really my style.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Seriously!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, more importantly...did you hear that Gluttony Foss has been making an effort to procure supplies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>This is quite well known amongst my fellow mercenaries, but it seems like some kind of conflict is brewing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Is that true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yep, yep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Because of that, all the notorious mercenaries have made their way there making it difficult to find good people to hire here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If they're going to consume more, then of course supplies will sell better, right? Especially Envylia supplies since the desert between the two countries makes trade difficult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>All right. I think I'll pay them a visit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hey, are you sure you're taking this seriously?! A regular trip is one thing, but you're gonna have to bring a lot of stuff if you're gonna trade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Do you know how long it'll take to prepare a horse for starters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I've got it all planned out. I know more than a few merchants who would lend me their horse on a moment's notice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Sigh... You're well-connected as usual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Well, I'm a merchant. Getting along with people...no, bringing people together is also part of my job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It's your hobby as well, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hehe. It's more than a hobby. Meeting new people is a once-in-a-lifetime chance that's worth its weight in gold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Besides, since I'll be mostly just checking things out this time, I'm going to try and negotiate for a caravan headed towards Gluttony to take me with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>A caravan, huh? I think you trust others a little too much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Faith and trust are the most important assets that a merchant can have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah. I've heard that over and over again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>But be careful, all right? I've heard rumors that pirates are targeting merchants more and more these days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Seriously. You're such a worrier, Elaine...whoops, gotta hurry. I need to catch an early caravan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Fine, fine. Be safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Got it. I'm off then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Umm. First I'll arrange for a horse cart...oh, before that, I need to find a caravan that is headed to Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Huh? The city gates seem really busy. I wonder if a large caravan just arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Oh, young lady, are you a merchant as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yes. I'm planning on crossing the desert from now and heading to Gluttony Foss. Did something happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Ah. Are you headed there too? Actually, I was planning on heading there myself, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I'm not very well informed about the trade route to Gluttony. The desert lies between, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Right now, there's talk about a large group of bandits showing up. Although, I'm sure there were a lot of them to begin with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Bandits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It seems like they've ended their skirmishes with the locals and have taken in some of the mercenaries who are desperate for food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Quite a large number of travelers and merchants have fallen victim. The leaders of Gluttony have finally been spurred into action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Do you mean that the Guild Guard has been summoned to take care of them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>No, no. If Gluttony were to send out soldiers to the outskirts of the border...that, more than anything, would lead to war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Instead, they've sent the Guild as they are familiar with the desert. Can you see them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Seriously. What a hassle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Is that the representative from the Guild?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>That's Ryle, the man of luck. Don't you know him? He's really famous around these parts. Apparently, he's the one who'll be leading this caravan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>People are relieved by his presence, so a lot of them are joining the guild's caravan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Can anyone join this caravan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Yeah. Apparently, they've also been tasked with protecting the merchants. Of course, Gluttony will be paying for the costs. So we'll be moving as one big family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>(Gluttony will be paying?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>(Also, from what I can see, even the rental supply wagons seem to be expensive. Isn't that a Slothstein-made Alchemic wagon?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>If I join this caravan, I'll be able to save a lot in costs. Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Dad, have you finished talking? I'm hungry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>You just ate. Honestly, we've got a long trip ahead so try to endure a little more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Hey, little fellow. Do you like fruits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, you're gonna give it to me?! Thank you, lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Ah. Sorry about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Not at all. It's my way of saying thank you for all the information you've given me. After all, information is a valuable trades good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You've got quite the skillful tongue on you, young lady. I hope we both do well in our trading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>We'll begin moving now! Those accompanying us, fall in line! Make sure to place your supplies on the shared wagons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Oh, looks like we're gonna start moving now. You should hurry, young lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Ah, right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>We're being attacked! Here come the bandits!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Prepare for battle! Don't let them close to the supplies...agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Focus on the food supplies! The woman and children can be sold for money! Try to leave them unharmed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Hyaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Tsk. There's a lot of them. Honestly. What a hassle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Captain Ryle! They're attacking from the rear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>We were tasked with protecting the merchants, not the supplies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I'll leave command to you. Try to save as many of the merchants as you can. Tell them to abandon their goods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>But there's too many of them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>What? Are you going to make me do everything? I brought you here precisely to deal with this kind of situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I don't recall having recruited such useless soldiers for the Guild.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Ye-yes, Sir! Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Men, we spread out and defend the rear and the front! If it comes down to it, don't hesitate to abandon the supplies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Protecting lives is our first priority! Do your duty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I can't believe such a large group of bandits would attack us! Where is that kid?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Waaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>It's okay...it's okay! Hurry, run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>You're not going anywhere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Agh! You wench!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Eeek?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Yo-young lady?! Hurry and run! If they surround us, it'll all be over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>B-but, at this rate, everyone will...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Surround the prey and scatter them! If they are spread out thin, even the Guild Guard wouldn't be able to put up a fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Ar-are we surrounded...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Hehe. Well, well. Looks like we've got some high quality prey mixed amongst the lot of them. Come now. Don't put up a fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Getting to work before the sun has set, are we now? You're a rude bunch of villains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Resolve yourselves, you sorry excuses of mercenaries. This place is already under the jurisdiction of the Sand Hawks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Each grain of sand contains the honor and resolve of our comrades who have long fought in order to protect the freedom of those who live in this desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>If you're going to tarnish this honor any further...then we'll have no choice but to end you all here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>It's the Sand Hawks! The bandit hunters are here...agh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Hey, who are you calling bandit hunters? I'd prefer if you didn't spread such titles. We are vigilantes, plain and simple!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Balt, you scum!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Not only are you sorry excuses for mercenaries...but you've gone so far as to become bandits, trampling on the freedom of the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>He-hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Stand back, young lady. From here on, this is our battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>We have long fought and bled to maintain our reputation as mercenary vigilantes that protect this desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>And now these idiots are attempting to destroy it all. We'll send them packing out of this desert!</td>
</tr>
