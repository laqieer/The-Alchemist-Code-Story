<td>The map shows that we can go along this river to reach the Ratty's nest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Waah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The ground is muddy and slippery around here. Let's be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Maybe this will make it easier to walk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>…! You're right, it is easier now! What did you do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I turned the mud into a more solid form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You can do that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Water-absorbing magic is a specialty of mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But due to this power and origin, people have used me for selfish things…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Legend has it that my ancestors were mermaids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I don't know if it's true and I personally don't believe it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But people don't really care about finding the facts. They just want to believe what they want to believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What they want to believe… Also sounds like the people who believed I was a vampire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Basically, one and the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I believe in myself and I don't care about looking into the past. But they have no desire to see me for who I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>They have these illusions built up and they try to throw them onto me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>They became envious, jealous…and did a lot of things that I wouldn't approve of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up your past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I said it because I wanted to say it. No need to apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>…Taking advantage of others, trying to grab them or touch them… That's why I hate people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's just plain disgusting to think about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>And that's why I avoid people. It makes me uncomfortable and I don't want to get close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tethys…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We may both avoid people, but we have our differences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But I admit… I don't dislike you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We have some similarities, but some differences too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Even though you are uncomfortable with other people, you make an effort to stand up against your fears and that's great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You also have trauma like me, but instead of looking the other way, you're on a new path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I respect you, Cordelia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>R-respect…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You're really going to just give up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>When I see you trying, I feel strangely encouraged...it would be a shame if you just...gave up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That's just my thought…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm…encouraging you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>By looking at what you're saying, it's making me think that talking to some people might be a good thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Even that little girl who wanted me to play with her. Maybe I could have…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Though I'm not good with children…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm feeling like I should give it a bit of a try at the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Tethys…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Why don't we…try helping each other? Together with you I feel I can try harder and not give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I don't know what else I can do, but I hope you can become friendly with that little girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You're right. I think I can with you by my side. Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>But before we do that, let's head to the nest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
