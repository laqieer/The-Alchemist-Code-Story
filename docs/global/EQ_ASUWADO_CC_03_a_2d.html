<td>Would you like some tea, Carla?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, yes, please. Thank you.</td>

<td>Hey, Ryle! Care to join the land of the living?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Whaaaat...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We've come all this way to see you. The least you can do is wake up and give us a proper reception, you lazy oaf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ehh, nah, you're fine. I've got my own work to deal with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You grumble about being busy far more than the guild members who are actually on task!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And you're sleeping rather well for a guy with a mark on his head. Letting down on your guard will end up doing you in, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>All the more reason now is the perfect time for me to get some rest while I still can, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'll wake up when the situation calls for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmph. I know you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh! Najam, was it? Long time no see. What an unexpected surprise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm extremely grateful to you for giving me a bit of a break last time we met. But this time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well, let's just say I won't be holding back, should you plan to turn your blade toward Master Ryle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I don't recall giving you a break last time. As I said then, you simply weren't my mark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Things are different this time, however. I'll do what I must to complete my mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I see. In that case, I'm afraid I'm going to have to stand in your way, and things might get a bit messy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(I don't get it. Why is he so adamant about protecting that wreck of a guild captain?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(No... That's none of my concern. I have a job to do. Nothing else matters.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>From the outside, it seemed rather empty in here. Not many guild members in attendance today. It's good to know that assessment was correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to have to cut through you to get to my mark. Do pardon the intrusion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Lady Najam!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Look out! They've got reinforcements!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Tch. All these maggots, crawling out of their holes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Seems like we've got a pest problem indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Master Ryle! You've finally decided to move those lazy bones of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What, you think I'd miss this party? You all take care of the riff-raff. I'll handle Najam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So, you do actually get out of bed from time to time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I do what I want. And whatever I need to do to protect my people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The Desert Wings are my people. And I'm not about to let anyone walk all over them.</td>
