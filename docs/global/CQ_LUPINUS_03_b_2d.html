<td>Agh...I guess...we lack the strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Sigh... Do you think it's safe now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes. It appears so. That being said, why did you help me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Although we may both be acquainted with Mielikki, this is the first time we've personally met...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I-I was so absorbed in the moment, I'm not sure why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We're not even friends—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...So-sorry. I'm not used to receiving so much kindness from someone. I spoke unnecessarily...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>N-no, it's fine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...I may cause you further inconvenience if I were to encounter similar individuals. I'll lay low until the ceremony begins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...My apologies. Goodbye then.</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Pl-please, wait! I don't...I don't want that!</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>U-um, in response to what you said earlier...why can't we be friends?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Friends...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>When I became friends with Mielikki...my world changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Even when it came to trivial matters, having a friend there meant the world to me. That happened time and again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I just wanted to lend you my support in that way, Peridot. That's all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Y-yes! I can do my best when it comes to looking after my friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...I got really sad when you told me just now that we weren't friends, Peridot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But...it also made me aware of my own feelings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I...don't have too much confidence, but there's one thing I can say with all my heart...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I want to lend my strength to you, Peridot...as a friend! Just as Mielikki lent her strength to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But we—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Have all the time in the world to become friends from now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hehe. You're right. I'm really sorry about what I said earlier. There are a lot of things that I'm still not familiar with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm really bad at interacting with people to the point that I can't even engage in fun conversation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Still, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You really are kind, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Peridot...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Thanks to that unwanted trouble, I missed out on eating lunch. Would you...like to eat with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...Oh! Yes, by all means!</td>
