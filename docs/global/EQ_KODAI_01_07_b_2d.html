<td>Enough!</td>

<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Heh...heheh. I must say, you are dreadfully strong, even with perplexity ailing your mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I've been trained as such.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Bear in mind, though, that perplexity—that uncertainty—will inevitably bring you harm if left unchecked.</td>

<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>So, once again, I ask: What do you want to do? What do you fight for? If you can't find your answer to these questions—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I will protect Lil. No matter what, till the end of this journey. That's all there is to it. There is no uncertainty there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>All right. For now, I'm perfectly willing to accept that. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Your dear daughter is at my mansion. Go to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>She's...not actually my daughter. You know this, right?</td>

<td>...</td>

<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>The minutest release of my powers, and this is the result... I may be closer to the end of my own journey than I initially thought.</td>

<td>Zafeiris. There's little I can do for you with the time I have left.</td>

<td>I pray you find your reason to save the world, while I'm still around to help guide you on the right path.</td>

<td>Sia's my friend now!</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>(Or perhaps it's because she can, that Lil is to be our hope...)</td>

<td>Zafeiris?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Ah, it's nothing, Lil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>Okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>You are to set out on a journey from here. You must see the many lands of this world, and come to know the lives and livelihoods of humans and dragons alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Then, you must make a choice regarding this world's future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>Uh, okay. I'll do my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>(I can't help but wonder, am I asking something cruel of her? This world is by no means an amicable place.)</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yes. Though, everything beyond that beginning has been a journey of perpetual loss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>From the many encounters and bonds formed, to the very moment they all became meaningless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>To me, these memories are nothing more than a retracing of the first moments of an unspeakable tragedy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>But for you, there may be some important new discoveries to unearth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>You must dive deeper. Further within my memories, you will find the power you seek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/drg_wagi_wiz_01.png" alt="Waginau" height="128"><br>Waginau</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/drg_wagi_wiz_01.png" alt="Waginau" height="128"><br>Waginau</td>

<td>Surely there is something within it that can help me save Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Very well. I shall open another gate of memories.</td>
