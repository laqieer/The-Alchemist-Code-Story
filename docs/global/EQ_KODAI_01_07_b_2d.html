<td>Enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Heh...heheh. I must say, you are dreadfully strong, even with perplexity ailing your mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I've been trained as such.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Bear in mind, though, that perplexity—that uncertainty—will inevitably bring you harm if left unchecked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So, once again, I ask: What do you want to do? What do you fight for? If you can't find your answer to these questions—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I will protect Lil. No matter what, till the end of this journey. That's all there is to it. There is no uncertainty there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>All right. For now, I'm perfectly willing to accept that. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Your dear daughter is at my mansion. Go to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>She's...not actually my daughter. You know this, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The minutest release of my powers, and this is the result... I may be closer to the end of my own journey than I initially thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Zafeiris. There's little I can do for you with the time I have left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I pray you find your reason to save the world, while I'm still around to help guide you on the right path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lil! Are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Zafeiris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Are you all right? Did anyone hurt you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm fine! Sia and Quence have been very nice to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh, hello. My name is Ambrosia. I'm a witch in training. It's nice to meet you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm Quence. So you're this little lady's guardian?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Gotta say, you don't look the part.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Thank you for taking care of Lil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Not a problem! Please, there's no need to bow! It sort of just...happened. I absolutely didn't do anything worthy of receiving a dragon's gratitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Sia's my friend now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(Friends, huh? Could a dragon and human truly share that sense of companionship?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(Or perhaps it's because she can, that Lil is to be our hope...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Zafeiris?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ah, it's nothing, Lil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You are to set out on a journey from here. You must see the many lands of this world, and come to know the lives and livelihoods of humans and dragons alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Then, you must make a choice regarding this world's future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Uh, okay. I'll do my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(I can't help but wonder, am I asking something cruel of her? This world is by no means an amicable place.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(Both humans and dragons have flaws that run deep.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(Is this world truly worth saving, such as it is?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(I'm not so sure.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That which you just saw is but a fragment of what made me who I am now. They were memories of a past long since lost to the sands of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I could feel the sensation of your dragon power, surging through my body... The instinctive logic of motion in combat... There was much in there for me to learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So this was the beginning of your travels with that girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes. Though, everything beyond that beginning has been a journey of perpetual loss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>From the many encounters and bonds formed, to the very moment they all became meaningless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>To me, these memories are nothing more than a retracing of the first moments of an unspeakable tragedy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>But for you, there may be some important new discoveries to unearth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You must dive deeper. Further within my memories, you will find the power you seek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Right. I suppose there's no time to hesitate, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Show me, Zafeiris. Show me your past despair. I will do what I can to give it meaning and purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Surely there is something within it that can help me save Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Very well. I shall open another gate of memories.</td>
</tr>
