<td>Why?! Why would you do something so terrible?!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>All this will accomplish is repeating past tragedies.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So you survived, after all, Agatha Crowley. As promised, let's continue our talk. Come.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>As Sabareta moves forward, the citizens of Envylia, in an attempt to protect Agatha, stand in the way of the Lizard Brigade with pitchforks and sticks.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Do-don't come closer! Lady Agatha is our beacon of hope! We'll never give her to you!</td>

<td>So, you civilians, who've never held a sword in your life, plan to fight our blades with your sticks.</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Stop! Everyone, stand back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Do-don't worry! We won't let them lay a finger on you, Lady Agatha!</td>

<td>I believe I told you not to lay a hand on any who are not knights. Do you need to be reminded of my orders?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>M-my apologies, Sir!</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...Why?</td>

<tr>

<td>Unlike your incorrigible knights of Envylia, we don't lay hands on civilians.</td>

<td>Lord Sabareta! There are Envylia knights in front of us! We're surrounded!</td>

<td>Tsk! I'll wipe them out! You lot, bring hostages!</td>

<td>I'll lead you to an underground passage that takes you outside the castle. Use that, and you'll be able to leave without unnecessary conflict.</td>

<td>You expect me to take your offer seriously?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
