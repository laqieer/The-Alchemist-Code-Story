<td>You want us to deal with the Fallen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. After seeing what you all are capable of, I'd like to ask you to lend us your power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>If the Fallen keep multiplying like this, the villagers will be forced to evacuate in the near future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You must have noticed already, but the villagers and the people of the city live completely different lifestyles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The people here work hard, day in and day out, living in fear of the earthquakes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I don't want these people to suffer more than they already do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I think we should help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If there's something we can do that will help all these people, shouldn't we do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I agree. The teachings of the Sephira say that our powers exist to rid the world of corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It may be as you say, but this complicates things. Those who fight here cannot also search for Icona.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The people of the village are capable miners. They'll be able to help you with that in your stead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Truthfully, they'll probably be more effective at finding the scouting team than a search party made up of people with no sense of the area would be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That certainly makes sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm fine with that. Even with a map, knowing the area makes a huge difference.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This village... It might be where we were born. To lose it would be a tragedy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I understand. We'll do what we can to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The Fallen are in the tunnel up ahead. Looks like they're nesting where the locals say the Stones of the Gods are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's possible that the inspection team left some signs of where they were heading. It's worth a look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I see. Lead the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This is the mine of the Stones of the Gods...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There's so much magil I can barely breathe... It almost reminds me of the arboreal altar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Really? I don't feel anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Me neither. I guess us people of Acedia aren't sensitive to magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ambrosia said the same thing, didn't she? Something about how you have no talent for it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't remind me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There are so many Fallen... Yet none of them are reacting to our presence. Is that...normal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Good question... As far as I know, Fallen attack every living thing before them, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Well, there's no point sitting here wondering. Let us purify them before they make it out of the mines and attack someone!</td>
</tr>
