<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Are you all right, Su Yi? Are you hurt? It's going to be okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>S-sorry. I'm f-fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Thank goodness! Don't run off like that, okay? You scared us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>S-sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hahah! There's no need for that. I'm used to impulsive kids charging off on their own. Don't worry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmph. Well, I'm used to dealing with overbearing instructors who lack poise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hey! That's mean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Not really... Those qualities are also your strengths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>In any case... Su Yi, there's nothing for you to fear. Bertha is a very kind person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>She's been orphaned... I feel sorry for her, but I sure as heck can't look after her. I'm barely making it through the day with just myself to take care of, just like everyone else in this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Besides, she's sick, ain't she? Can't work her, can't sell her. Can't afford to take care of some good-for-nothin'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's gonna be all right, Su Yi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>From now on, you're with us! You, me, and Liu Shen—we're as good as family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Shenmei...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Th-thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Relax! We just want to help! Could you tell us why you ran off like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I wanted to help look for Shenmei, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ohh! I guess hearing all that stuff about the octopuses made you worried, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But Liu Shen wanted us to wait here for him. We ought to stay put.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Where would we even begin to search?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There's that face again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I told you, if you have something to say, you ought to say it. You can't expect people to read your mind. Remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I know you're shy, but if we're going to be working together, communication is essential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Aw, Sharon. We only just met. She can't help it! Not everyone is capable of the same things right off the bat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I...suppose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So don't push yourself too hard on our account, Su Yi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I bet Liu Shen will find Shenmei in no time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You're both very kind and dependable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Am I...dependable?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Of course you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(And here I am, depending on their kindness and waiting for them to talk to me...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(I might be a Phantom Soldier, but I guess nothing much has changed. I'm just the same old Su Yi.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(Depending on Shenmei and Liu Shen to take care of me...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What's up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Su Yi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What's wrong?! Are you feeling sick? Did something happen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>N-no! I'm...fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh... Good. You just looked like you were on the verge of tears, that's all. I was concerned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Where did you come from?! You scared the life outta me, you maniac!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ahem... My apologies. I am simply very protective of Xiao-Xiao here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Is there a reason for that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Xiao-Xiao was born with a fragile constitution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>We come from a very poor, remote village. We couldn't buy medicine or get her the care she needed—there wasn't even a doctor for her to see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Not only that...but she was orphaned at a young age and there was no one to take care of her. So you see, that's why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>According to this map, the herbs that we need to make that cure-all are in this cave!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Still, it is far too dangerous. We would have to cross the sea! Besides, that location is known to be a den of monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I've told you before and I'll tell you again! It's my dream to become a legendary pirate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'll never be worthy of such a title if I can't even save my precious little sister! We might not be connected by blood, but pirates look after their own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Shenmei...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hrrgh! I've had it up to here with all these octopuses!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Not another one! Just leave me alone, will ya?! Squelchy vermin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Not an octopus, I'm afraid. Although I could use an extra arm or two...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Holy sea cow! Is that you, Kaya?! I can't believe it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I could say the same. What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I don't really know. I was just chasing this suspicious shadowy thing and before I knew it, I was in this cave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>A suspicious shadow...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>If I was gonna go exploring, I'd much prefer it to be in some ruins! At least then I'd have a better chance of stumbling across some treasure...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Ruins such as these?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>The only ruins of note on this island are the ones I am currently investigating. That is, the ones in which we are currently standing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>What?! You're telling me these are ruins?! I thought this was just some smelly old cave!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It certainly is a cave, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yet it is here, in these naturally-formed caverns, that we can find altars and other archeological remnants of an ancient religion that was once declared heretical and promptly stamped out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>What at a glance appears to be an ordinary cave is in fact an archeological site, erased from the annals of history and forgotten by the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I think most people on the island are not aware that this site even exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>So these caves are actually ruins... Does that mean it's here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You know about that? About the Demon sealed within these ruins?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Grooorgghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Speak of the devil...and it shall appear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Hang on! That wasn't what I was talking about!</td>
</tr>
