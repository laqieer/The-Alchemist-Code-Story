<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Can I have a moment, Xiao-Xiao?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What can I do for you, Liu Shen? Is this about the new alliance again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That situation is still developing, but now I'm here to report on our recruitment efforts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh my! Seems you've been quite busy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We're finally joining the Great Order of Pirates, so we must swell our ranks. Having the appropriate personnel is paramount.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You intend to grow our numbers this much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Naturally. We have many rivals. Improving information gathering, expanding our base of operations, diplomacy... The more pirates we have the more we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>As we discussed before, I'll take responsibility for all of it. You needn't trouble yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Understood. I leave it to you. But if anything peculiar should arise, consult me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Pardon the intrusion! A letter has arrived from the Great Order of Pirates we recently allied with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmph. And what does it say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It is a request for aid. One of the islands they control is under attack by monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see. And this enemy is too strong for them to handle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No... They seem capable of dealing with it on their own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>However, they're saying the captain and first mate should come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why would they ask us to do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If they're saying they want us there, then we should go, Liu Shen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Are you sure? But I suppose you're right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If we comply and go to fight alongside our fellow captains, then we can deepen our alliance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But the other pirate crew is quite large, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That the captain would come to us doesn't seem like they're overly focused on us to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Our presence is simply that important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This event will be remembered and recorded, and should act as a stepping stone to building our partnership.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Is it really all right that you two go alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We'll be fine. But while we're away, please look after the Xiao Shenmei!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You needn't worry! And take care!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well then, Liu Shen... Shall we go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Let's be off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The monster incursion is ahead in the depths of this cave. We're supposed to meet the others here, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The stench of the infernal is strong. Let's deal with this quick and be gone... Ahem...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Captain Shenmei of the Xiao Shenmei reporting! I've come to lend aid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh! Thank you for coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Due to an urgent matter, the captain and first mate couldn't come, so I'm here as council, instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Now, where're these monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>As to monsters... They're there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Xiao-Xiao!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What's the meaning of this? We came here to rescue you! What is this treachery?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Treachery? Don't make me laugh! We're pirates! We use whatever means to get ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You're no different. Didn't you do whatever it took to prosper?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We're not like that! We got this far by building trust and working together with many others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We would never stab our allies in the back. That is sheer cowardice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hmph. What weak fools.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>They're taming monsters... Hell! This is a training facility for demons, and we're now on the menu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We've faced worse. Come on, Liu Shen! Let's turn the tables!</td>
</tr>
