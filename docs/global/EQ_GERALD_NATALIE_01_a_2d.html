</tr>
<tr>

<td>Dissected? What's that? I wanna try!</td>

<td>Argh! Natalie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gerald's Father</td>
<td>Hahahah! You two get along so well. But forget about dissection for a second. See, what I was trying to do was teach you about analysis. On the field of battle, pure analysis can be your strongest ally.</td>
</tr>

<td>Got it! I'm gonna work so hard, dad. I wanna be just like you!</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Having something to protect is what will make you strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gerald's Father</td>
<td>For example, what I want to protect in this world is you. You and your mother. That is what centers me. It gives me the willpower I need to fight to protect everything, as a knight should.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>So, ask yourself. What is it you want to protect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/gera.png" alt="Gerald" height="128"><br>Gerald</td>
