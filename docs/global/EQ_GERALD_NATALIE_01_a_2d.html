<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>That day, we swore an oath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>All we wanted was a blissful world filled with laughter and joy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We hereby swear to defend the setting Scarlet and hold in our hearts the Flames to manifest our iron will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Our blades we wield only to protect the happiness of the people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And I promise to always support these two rash, reckless idiots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We vow now and forevermore to be the defenders of the Scarlet Flame!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Here, we swear that our iron will shall stand indomitable in the face of hardship in order to ensure the joy and laughter of the people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We swore it. I am certain we did—but then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What am I doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Gerald? What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Testing, testing, one, two, three! Calling for Gerald! Come on, I know you can hear me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>How can you be so...lighthearted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>How can you look so scary? Also, what's up? Pretty sure I asked you first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It has nothing to do with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There you go again, trying to shoulder all your burdens on your own. I bet you were thinking about Vettel. Am I right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I knew it! Bull's eye. Remember what I told you? Brooding looks good on you but it won't do you any good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm not brooding! And I certainly wouldn't be caught dead wasting my time thinking about a traitor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>He chose a different path, but only because he wanted to make as many people smile as he could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>At least joining the Holy Guard would do you a lot better than roaming around Envylia sulking. It'd definitely help make you stronger, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>S-sulking?! We of the Scarlet Legion are undertaking meaningful endeavors across the—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I know, I know. We're doing great things. Isn't that good enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well... No one is really that interested in asking the Scarlet Legion to do anything yet, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But that just proves that Envylia is currently at peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We do get requests to eliminate bandits and such, from time to time. Envylia has yet to fully find its feet as a country, and until it does, one can expect that crafty fellows on the lookout for opportunities will be lurking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>True enough. Taking down people like that is definitely part of carrying out your oath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Exactly. It is essential. You see? It has nothing to do with Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>There you go, mentioning him again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Look at you, getting all flustered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wha—?! I am not getting flustered! I am perfectly calm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I was, in fact, flustered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I was aware of that much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The requests that arrived for our Scarlet Legion were few and far between. That fact alone made things difficult. I still couldn't be sure of anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Was forming the Scarlet Legion really the right thing to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Would this path really allow me to carry out my oath? Would Vettel leave me in the dust?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Lately, I have found myself frequently reminded of my father's words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Those words I admired so much, spoken by the man I felt I ought to surpass...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Dad, tell me the story one more time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You really like this one, don't you, son? I'm surprised war is so interesting to a young man like yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's not because I like war or anything. I just love hearing your stories!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You're always doing everything you can to fight for people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Listening to your stories, all I can think about is how cool knights are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>They're always fighting so hard for so many people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>When I grow up, I want to be a strong and worthy knight just like you, dad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>It takes more than excellent swordsmanship to be a strong and worthy knight, my son.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huh?! Really? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Shut up, Natalie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Hahahahah! Leave her be, son. I think she should hear this, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>A strong and worthy knight must have a solid heart, technique, and physique.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>If it's a one-on-one fight, strength is probably enough to win the day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>However, when it comes to an order of knights going up against another organization, they—and especially their commander—need more to find their way onto the path to victory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You're talking about your big battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Hahahahah! I suppose I am. We only won that one because I analyzed the enemy's tactics and dissected their strategy to figure out what their ultimate goal was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Dissected? What's that? I wanna try!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Natalie! Cut it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>What'd I do?! Why do you always get so angry at me?! I'll dissect you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Hahahahah! You've got spirit, kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Yeah! I've got spirit, so lemme dissect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Argh! Natalie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Hahahah! You two get along so well. But forget about dissection for a second. See, what I was trying to do was teach you about analysis. On the field of battle, pure analysis can be your strongest ally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Got it! I'm gonna work so hard, dad. I wanna be just like you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Really, now? In that case, there's one more thing I have to tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ask yourself this: what do I want to protect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Having something to protect is what will make you strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>For example, what I want to protect in this world is you. You and your mother. That is what centers me. It gives me the willpower I need to fight to protect everything, as a knight should.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>So, ask yourself. What is it you want to protect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I...I wanna protect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What're you doing, Gerald? Don't think too hard or you'll get wrinkles!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>N-no I won't! Leave me alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Oops! Gerald, your hair is sparking again! It's like it's full of lightning!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You're being ridiculous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You know, you've always been sensitive. The little things always get to you, don't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Just look at yourself! You're all sparky! It's painful to look at!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I can't remember the last time I saw you smile. Or heard you laugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>So let me dissect you—analyze you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>No, thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Brother Gerald! A group of monsters is attacking a nearby village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Everyone, move out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
