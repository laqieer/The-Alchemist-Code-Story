<td>001</td>
<td>Ahaha! You knew it was me the entire time and you still came at me with all you had? Talk about rude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Knowing it was you just gave me extra motivation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ahaha, incredible! You're still surprising me after all this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're supposed to announce yourself when you arrive. I hope you're not pulling this kind of thing on the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't worry! I'm on my best behavior. I've just been quietly observing all of you. Looks like everyone's giving it their all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Scarlet Flame Guard seems to have matured quite a bit compared to how things used to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I even heard some rumors about Chloe's Crown's Guard while I was travelling through the other countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Most of them are watching pretty carefully to see if it's an effective stopgap while we rebuild our forces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>She's got a pretty tough job if you ask me, with a lot of eyes on her. I'm just your average assassin, but even I can guess that it's no picnic leading a unit like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You're right, she's had to run a strict ship to keep things under control here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But she's done very well so far. Many of the troops admire her. I'm sure they'll grow into excellent knights under her watchful eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I saw that Nina's got a lot on her plate, too. Working as Vice-Captain while also acting as a bridge between humans and therians.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Victor's come along, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Helping out Vice-Captain Nina, inspiring the people around him... Lots of good things said about him after that whole Saga thing, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Indeed. Victor has become quite the reliable knight. Everyone's come so far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>To the point where recently I've been thinking that I can leave the future of the Scarlet Flame Guard, the future of all of Envylia, in their hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh, really? If you got that much trust in 'em, how 'bout you start entrusting them with some of that responsibility now? No need to wait for the future to come first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>There's no reason to wait if you think they're ready for it. If you don't think they are, well, I mean... But you do, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What? What's with that look?! Don't freak me out like that! Did I say something wrong?! Did I?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ah, no! It's not wrong, I was simply surprised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I just never thought that you of all people would be so straightforward with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well, how else would I get through to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's not like it's a secret why I'm so straight with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You didn't forget, right? Gerald also entrusted his last wishes to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ah, that's right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, I guess you have a point. About trusting the others a little more, but...it's not the time for that yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The knights are already spread so thin. I can't heap any more responsibilities onto them or else they might just collapse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Is that why you're doing it all by yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>For now. The Blue Flame Guard is recovering. I heard from the king that their new Captain is very enthusiastic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Once they're back on their feet, the Scarlet Flame Guard won't have to carry things all by themselves any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I just have to ride this out. Then, when things stabilize, I'll be able to leave it to the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Envylia will be able to overcome this situation as long as the Blue and Scarlet Flame Guards work together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hmm... Well, I get where you're coming from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But I feel like you're overlooking one very important thing. Or rather, pretending not to see it at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Pretending it's not there doesn't mean no one else can see it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...Well, I'll be around, so I'll keep an eye out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hey, those inspection guys were pretty quick on their feet coming here, don't you think? Even though the Holy Guard's probably got a lot on their plate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>They were sniffing around the village, too. Wonder what's got them so interested in this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hmm... So the ruins stretch this far. It isn't just the surrounding area... Even the village may very well be part of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The historical value of this place is immeasurable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I've analyzed the geological sample. It's as we expected: a strong alchemical presence is present throughout the entire village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The concentration gets higher as you approach the ruins, but it is still incredible that it managed to reach even the village. I wonder what could be inside...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's incredible... Still, from an alchemic standpoint, this village could be very dangerous. It's calm and peaceful now, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Well... The Scarlet Flame Guard is keeping an eye out, so I'm sure it'll be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(It wouldn't be such a big deal if these were regular ruins, but there's something weird about these... There might even be—)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...! This is a.... So that means there must be a key somewhere...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hee hee! Tag, you're it! Try and catch me! Wee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oh dear, I'm sorry they're keeping you so busy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Not at all! If anything, I'm having a lot of fun myself. If anything, I should apologize to you! It's probably not comfortable having us noisy interlopers hanging around all the time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's only natural. You don't discover ruins right on your doorstep every day. The investigation's quickly become the talk of the town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Even the Holy Guard's arrived in this quaint little village! It's something of a relief to know the Scarlet Flame Guard is here to protect us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hey, I'm back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Vettel! Oh, you brought Ren with you, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yup, I got some time to kill, so I tagged along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You got free time? Are you done already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We've dealt with the monsters that reside within the ruins, so the situation should be safe enough for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If anything happens, I trust that the Scarlet Flame Guard will be able to handle it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Is that so? That's a relief...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Natalie! Come on! Are you playing hide-and-seek with us or not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I found something super cool! So come and get me, then I can show it to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Ah, I'm sorry. This is an important grown-up chat, we can play again after—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Aw, but you need to see this! Look! When I hold it up to the light like this, it gets all greenish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Isn't that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Oh, we've been finding that type of stone in town here and there lately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>We've been digging here and there to find materials for the reconstruction effort. That's probably why we're running into so many of them now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>How interesting! Maybe it's a type of ore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hey kiddo, why don't you hand that pretty stone to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Aw, I dunno...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Pretty please? I'll trade you some candy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hmm, in that case... Okay, I'll trade you! I can go find another anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>This is a problem. If these are showing up in the village and those ruins... We can't just let this be.</td>
</tr>
