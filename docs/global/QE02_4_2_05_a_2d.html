<td>I can't believe the clock tower that I was so accustomed to as a child could appear so frightening now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Heh. I would say whatever ability you received from your ancestors is in some ways much more frightening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What? Ability?</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If my guess is correct...the clock is only part of this tower's function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I believe the real reason this clock tower exists is to seal the true disaster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The true disaster?!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>How can I explain it...</td>

<td>This clock tower is most likely an enormous contraption to counteract Alchemic energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I guess you could say it's a kind of anti-gravity device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Do you mean that is a mechanism that relies on the Belphegor's Alchemic energy to function?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yep. There was a podium on the other side of the clock's face dial, wasn't there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>By placing the Sacred Stone Belphegor there, I believe it was restraining the power of the Demon Ore sleeping beneath the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I believe that this clock tower is a gigantic storage that restrains the true disaster sleeping beneath its surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What...?! Wh-what is that disaster?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sorry, but we've got company. Let's go underground. Hold on tight.</td>
