<td>Ah, I guess that bell means the bridal fair is over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's so nice to see the smiles on everyone's faces as they exit the venue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So, it went smoothly, Ewan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'd say so. Nothing out of ordinary to report. I guess my part is done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That reminds me. Once this job is over, care to join me for a board game?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We may have been called here as Phantoms, but we’re allowed to have a little fun, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Sure, why not? I might actually enjoy playing against an army commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Coming from you that's quite the compliment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm still shocked a famous military man like yourself was called to Greed Dike for bridal fair security.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Is that right? You're quite the big shot yourself, Supreme Naval Commander of Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Honestly, I don't mind these kinds of gigs. A soldier's duty is to secure the people's happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Everyone seems excited to check out the venue and try on dresses for the wedding rehearsals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I get a kick out of watching it all. I'm probably better at this than I am at combat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh? If that's the case, you should've seen the event for yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I would've loved to...but there's no way I could leave my post.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Besides, I'd kill the mood if I barged in with my military uniform on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>…You never change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hey! I'm just saying every man has his place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Also, I heard a band of thieves has been stirring up trouble lately. Best be on guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Word travels fast. So, you're aware of the situation. They say--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Mei Fa--ng!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What's the matter? Must you yell?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Please forgive the intrusion, Lady Mei Fang. Lady Lucia has an urgent matter to discuss with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Darn tootin'! I was looking everywhere for you! I have a huge favor to ask!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wait a minute... Lucia? Is that you, Lucia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>*Sigh* Lucia, you've made weapons for Ewan countless times…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh? I have? Let me see that weapon for a second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh! Right, right! I remember this one--gave me a real hard time! How does it handle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Quite well. I've survived all manner of threats thanks to your handiwork.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>By the way, why are you all dressed up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well, we're providing on-site security, so we thought it best to blend in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>More of us are needed to handle recent threats to public safety, but we don't want to alarm anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Gotcha…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Say, why don't you join the party, Ewan? I'd love to hear your opinion as a weapons connoisseur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>My opinion? About what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well, you see…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>*Swoon* What a breathtaking wedding that was! I can't wait to get married!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh! Oh! I have an idea! Why don't we have a wedding rehearsal, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Us? What exactly do you want to rehearse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well, um… The bride and groom practiced reading letters to their parents, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes! It was deeply moving! I couldn't help tearing up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Right? Let's try doing that! It'll be a chance to express our gratitude for one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You know, the part I really liked was the cake-cutting ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That special-looking knife they used was all sparkly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The wedding knife? Actually, I heard it was hand crafted from Felicitite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Felicitite? I've made weapons from that before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I don't remember it being that shiny, though. Maybe because I wasn't making wedding knives...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Come to think of it, I've never made a wedding knife before…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Maybe I should give it a shot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh! That's perfect, Lucia! If you make the wedding knife…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Then we'll all cut the cake together and have a lovely party!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You got it! I'll make the finest knife you'll ever see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>So, that's why I'd like you two to try out my wedding knife at the party.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Mei Fang is already familiar with my designs and, Ewan, you can share a military man's insight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>A military man's insight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Good grief... Your eyes start to twinkle whenever we talk about weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>*Giggle* I'm just so excited to make the world's sharpest wedding knife!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Knock yourself out. But keep in mind it's not the same thing as a weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It's not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Well, no. The point of a wedding knife isn't to hurt people, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Indeed, that's true. He has a point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>But a knife is still a weapon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Um… Well, yes. But a "wedding" knife isn't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Huh? So, you're saying a wedding knife isn't a weapon even though it's a knife?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Uzuma means that objects can be categorized based on their intended use. Don't overthink it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That I get. But don't you still use a wedding knife to cut?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>If you tell me it's not a weapon, I have a hard time imagining what to make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I think once I get my hands on some Felicitite, I'll think of something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Say, Uzuma, do you have any clue where I can find any?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Actually, my fortune-telling research indicates this area on the map.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Oh, that region? I remember there being a mine near that village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Are you familiar with the area?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I am. I visited once a while back... Bet I could even guide you around. But the mine…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>…Well, never mind. Why don't we just go have a look?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Alright! Let's get a move on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ahem, shouldn't we change first?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Nah! I'm sure these sparkly clothes will help me brainstorm some ideas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>O-Of course…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Is this a good idea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>We may be no use when it comes to weapon-making, but we sure can help throw a great party!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>There's no greater joy than the joy of helping others. Plus, I want to see this mine for myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>…Very well. It won't hurt to have a look, I suppose.</td>
</tr>
