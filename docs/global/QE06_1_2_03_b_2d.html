<td>Captain Tanosuke...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I asked you a question. What are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>N-no! Stay back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I... I've been...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ah. I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I said stay back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You've been bitten, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Aah... Aaaaahh! So... So you can smell it on me! I will not trouble you with—!</td>

<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This is the result of your naivete. You ignored the orders of your commanding officer's and went out acting on your own. And as a result, you got bitten by a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But... But I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I wanted to take out the Hidden Ogre as soon as possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well, getting yourself bitten for it does nobody any good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I-I know. I was... I was careless. I allowed the Hidden Ogre to bite me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wait, did you say by a Hidden Ogre?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huh?</td>

<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Geez, I thought one of the normal ones got you. Don't freak me out like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh? But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? The sentient pure-bloods amplify the corruption within people to turn them into demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I've never heard of a case where a bite from a pure-blood turned someone into a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>In other words...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You're freaking out over nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What? Wait, what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I mean, there's a chance that you could turn, but... Well... You'll probably be fine, almost definitely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Almost...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>If you do turn, I'll take care of it. Don't worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I mean, sure, you could turn later, but you haven't yet, so I don't think you need to worry. Phew... You scared me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hnngh... Nnnh... Waaaaah! I was so scared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Amane... Yeah, go on. Let it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Waaaaahhh!!! I'm so sorry! I'll never do that again! I'll do as you say from now on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Didn't you promise something like that not too long ago?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Waaaahh!! Waaaaaaaaaahhh!!!</td>
