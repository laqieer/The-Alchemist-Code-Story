<td>Well now, where shall we start our search?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I've been thinking about this, and I feel like we should start looking from the place where we first arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why do you think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I figured that this location could possibly have the strongest link with Arcania.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I see... That seems very plausible! Let's head that way then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh? The plants around here...don't we have these in Arcania as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yeah, you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We seem to be onto something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Alright, let's hurry up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hey, look! There's somebody on the ground there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>U-urghh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's...dangerous ahead...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You're badly wounded.<br>Were you attacked by the monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No, it wasn't just the monsters. The Black Dame showed up who attacked everyone without prejudice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Where are your allies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Everyone except me... My whole squad got annihilated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh boy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's...dangerous here!<br>The three of you...should run...as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>M-mister?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>He lost consciousness. We don't have the manpower to move him. Let's just let him rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So, what are we going to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Let's go ahead. If there really are monsters around here, we need to defeat them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That Black Dame the man at the bar spoke about may be there as well, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yeah, let's be on guard as we go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hey, look there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh no! It's the Black Dame!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>O-oh, u-umm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Heh... If you call me knight, I'll have to introduce myself. My name is Chloe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm Fencer, and we've come from Iorys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>My name is Harbinger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>And umm... I'm Shaman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hm, those are strange names. Are those your roles?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>When we're on a mission as a party, we call each other by our role names.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>H-hey, she's so scary...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Isn't that Dragoon equipment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh, you're right!<br>Are you a Dragoon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Could it be that you're also an adventurer who was summoned here from Arcania?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No, I'm a transmuted knight, or rather, a Phantom who was sent here to fix up a link to another world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But the transmutation into a Phantom got mixed up with aspects of another world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Is this... the equipment of your world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>By the way, is it true that apart from the monsters, you've also been attacking this country's knights?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>This country's knights... Yes, that is true. The transmutation crossed the scope of Alchemy, and it mixed up my memories, reversing them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I also...used to be a knight who protected this country's people. But that memory got reversed. Do you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I am acting against my own will... But I cannot stop myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>If you can't stop yourself, we have no choice but to stop you instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Right, we have to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Considering that you've come from a different world, the three of you may be able to fix me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Let's do it!!!</td>
</tr>
