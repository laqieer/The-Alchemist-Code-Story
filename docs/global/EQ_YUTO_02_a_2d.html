<td>It's called Stone Rust...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yuto.png" alt="Yuto" height="128"><br>Yuto</td>
<td>The tree suffers from consuming an excessive amount of Alchemia from the surrounding land. Ultimately, it becomes petrified.</td>

<td>More accurately, I came here to find its cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yuto.png" alt="Yuto" height="128"><br>Yuto</td>
<td>In the documents I've seen, the cause seems to be unknown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>Were the documents the ones from Northern Pride?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yuto.png" alt="Yuto" height="128"><br>Yuto</td>
<td>Yes, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>Then you won't find answers there. After all, it comes into conflict with the Magna Code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/luca.png" alt="Lucian" height="128"><br>Lucian</td>
<td>In other words, anything related to Alchemy has been frantically hidden by the Trading Company.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yuto.png" alt="Yuto" height="128"><br>Yuto</td>
<td>So...Stone Rust was caused by humans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>From long ago, the creation of Philosopher's Stones has always been a source of problems for Alchemists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>In the past, they condensed the Alchemia possessed by powerful goblins or sacrificed the lives of many...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>Amongst such trial and error, the research you mentioned began.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>By using the special properties of certain trees, Alchemia could be sucked up from the earth itself and used to make Philosopher's Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/luca.png" alt="Lucian" height="128"><br>Lucian</td>
<td>I've heard of that before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/luca.png" alt="Lucian" height="128"><br>Lucian</td>
<td>The desert between Gluttony Foss and Envylia used to be an independent country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/luca.png" alt="Lucian" height="128"><br>Lucian</td>
<td>However, due to the excessive experimentation for Alchemy, the land was exhausted and transformed into a sea of sand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>The excessive extraction using trees was probably one of the causes, although there seemed to be many others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>However, ultimately, that experiment ended in failure. The Philosopher’s Stones were never successful and all of this only resulted in exhausting the land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>Thus the study of Philosopher’s Stones moved more towards the expenditure of human life and blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/luca.png" alt="Lucian" height="128"><br>Lucian</td>
<td>It's a horrible story. So? Why are the people from the Trading Company trying to resume the experiment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>I think it’s because they think they can make a profit. Lucian, haven't you also heard about what happened in Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/luca.png" alt="Lucian" height="128"><br>Lucian</td>
<td>Yeah. Where they said Greed Dike was working behind the scenes, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/luca.png" alt="Lucian" height="128"><br>Lucian</td>
<td>It's true that if you were to mass produce Philosopher’s Stones using that information it would make a massive profit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yuto.png" alt="Yuto" height="128"><br>Yuto</td>
<td>That being said, why Saga? They should experiment in their own country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>I said it has to be a tree with special properties, right? That tree now only grows here in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yuto.png" alt="Yuto" height="128"><br>Yuto</td>
<td>That's why they came to this forest...</td>
</tr>
