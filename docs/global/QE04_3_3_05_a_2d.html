<td>I see. So there is a Wind Shaman from each of the three factions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. It surprised me as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hey, Lizzy! This flies by magic, right? How can I learn to use magic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>U-um...I never really thought about how. Are Broom Aces that rare?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah! Us men always dream of flying, you know? I'm so jealous! I wish I could fly as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Judging by the way he's acting now, he seems as childlike as his age. However, you say he is gradually increasing his power of the wind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes. That being said, we cannot afford to waste any time here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We will now head to Tehre and have him fulfill his promise to attend the Sprite Trio Discourse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Let's go, Mocca, Rega!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wait! I also want to go this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>As reassuring as it would be to have you with us...I need you to stay here, Lisbeth. There's no guarantee that the Jam won't attack again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Awww! But, I guess you're right. If I leave, itâ€™ll just be Fuu on his own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Lisbeth, but you are the only one I can entrust this task to. I'm relying on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>All right. Leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Let me touch your Broom Ace again sometime, Lizzy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>All right then...let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What's the matter, Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Lisbeth...Fuu...please, take care of Tamis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't worry, I'll watch her like a hawk. Come back safely, Mocca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Finally, it looks like the Sprite Trio Discourse is actually happening. We've somehow managed to get this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>When we finally show Tehre the token, he won't suddenly back down on his promise, will he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I doubt that. I don't know what Tehre is thinking, but he doesn't seem like the kind of person who would break a promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We've combined our strength and gotten this far. If something happens, we'll just need to overcome whatever stands in our way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...?! Hey, look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...The Gluttony army?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Wow...there's a lot of 'em! I guess that's supposed to be a blockade?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We have to pass this road in order to get to Port Nahema... Argh! Does Tehre intend to prevent us from getting there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Here come the vanguard troops! I guess we've got no choice! Let's withdraw!</td>
