<td>I'm sorry. We can't do that. We'd just create more problems for you to deal with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>You worry about me far too much. Besides, it's been a greater ordeal for me not knowing where you two are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Is it so wrong for a parent to be seen with her children?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mikaboshi - Sumeragi</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>I remember a time when Koga spoke to me just like that. You really are your father's kids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>But I know that your stubbornness comes from a place of love. You genuinely want what's best for me. And for that, I must thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>

<tr>

<td>...!</td>

<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>I'm sure it must have been hard out here by yourselves. But just know, I'm always here for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Now, would you be comfortable telling me what you've been up to since you left the castle? From the looks of things, you've been...busy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>I see. So you're saying our true enemy is the malice that lies in the heart of some unseen puppetmaster, and you've created a katana designed specifically to stand against that malice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Yeah. I forged it from the kitchen knife left behind by Father, based on instructions he'd written in his recipe journal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>I combined it with Mother's horn, too. But it's still not quite finished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Very interesting. Why a katana, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>I didn't inherit demonic strength like Mikaboshi did, so I'm dependent on human ingenuity to make up for it. But according to Father, the combination of both is needed anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Because even if peace can be forged between humans and demons again, a one-sided peace could never last. Both sides need to contribute equally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>And most importantly, the malice that led to all of this must be cleared away for good. It'll just keep sabotaging and undoing any peace efforts we might accomplish otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>All right. I think I understand. And I must say, this way of thinking is very...you, Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Even if we can't restore peace in our lifetime, this katana can be handed down to the next generation to keep the fight alive. I'm infusing my very will directly into its blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Hmm. So Wadatsumi can have its very own "spirit blade," then. I think there's a lot of potential in this idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>I intend to realize that potential. I won't let this malice get the better of us. Not after what it's done to Mother and Father, to you, and to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>Sumeragi has a much fiercer temperament than I do. But we're definitely on the same page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>I'm not trying to be fierce. I just can't abide those who would actively seek to create misery for others. I can't allow that kind of thinking to go unchallenged...or unpunished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Father might not have had something like this in mind, but this is what we need to do. For ourselves and for you, Lady Mitsuha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>Very nice. But don't think that just because you made some grand speech, I've forgotten how you used up our mother's horn without telling me! You're still a stupid jerk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Takes one to know one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>It's just no fair that you get to be the only one using that horn! I wanted to use it too! You never include me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Look, I said I'm sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Hahahaha! So that's what you two were arguing about. And it's a good thing you were, or I might never have found you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>But not to worry, Mikaboshi. Kaede had two horns, just like you. There was the one Sumeragi used, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Then there was this one, which she personally entrusted to me. Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>Is it...okay for me to have this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Kaede would want you to, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>So this is...Mother's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Do you know how to use it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha - Sumeragi</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>I won't let it get the better of us either, Sumeragi. This malice is robbing everyone of their happiness...and I will hunt it down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Mother, lend me your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Why are you holding the horn straight up like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>Hyaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>What?! Why would you stab yourself in the eye with it?! This isn't what I intended!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Mikaboshi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I'm fine. You know I heal quickly because of my demonic blood, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>That's not the issue here! What are you thinking?! What's wrong with you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>I just want to watch over everything—to see it all with unclouded vision. And this...is the proof of my resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>

<td>Mikaboshi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Incredible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>It... It became another eye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Could Mikaboshi's demonic blood have somehow...reached out to Kaede's soul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Is that even possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>It's the only explanation I've got, but even I have to admit, it stretches the bounds of reason. Maybe this is just a demon thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>It's definitely not just a demon thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>It doesn't matter what it is. As far as I'm concerned, Mother answered my wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>With this eye, I intend to root out every last bit of malice in the land. Nothing that means harm can evade my gaze.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>There can be no escape. I will behold all and track this malice to the ends of Babel, even if it kills me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Just seems a little unfair, if you ask me. I mean, I worked really hard to forge this sword, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>I had no idea any of this was going to happen. It just kind of happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Don't give me that. You used your demon powers to show off again, like you always do! Stupid jerk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Who are you calling a stupid jerk?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Yeah, and when you do, I'll cleave it in two with this sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mikaboshi - Sumeragi</td>
<td>And together, we'll bring Wadatsumi back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>Human and demon are reunited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>I'm finally beginning to see it. It really might happen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mikaboshi - Sumeragi</td>
<td>The future that Mother and Father envisioned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mikaboshi - Sumeragi</td>
<td>By way of the present that Lady Mitsuha strives to defend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>Even if it's impossible for one of us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>...the two of us together will succeed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mikaboshi - Sumeragi</td>
<td>We stake our lives on this will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>Though it's not like I plan on getting killed all that easily, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Me neither!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>All right, deal me in. I give you my full support as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>You aren't the only ones bearing heavy burdens right now. Plus, there's a little something I can do to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>That blade you forged, Sumeragi, and the eye you've formed,  Mikaboshi, may work a little differently than you're expecting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>So first, Sumeragi, I'd like you to set the blade down over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Uh, okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Hyaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>Was that...Kagutsuchi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>The flames of Kagutsuchi will temper the blade. A fitting touch for a sword designed to cut through malice, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>I'd say so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Just one forging won't suffice, though, so we'll take some time and work on it bit by bit. But before that, let's have a look at Mikaboshi's eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>Nuh-uh! No way! Don't even think about blasting me in the face with Kagutsuchi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Relax. I'm not planning to do anything of the sort. Just get over here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>For you... Here we are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>It's warm. What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>I guess you could say, it's a different application of Kagutsuchi. Another way of releasing the energy. Try pouring it over your eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>I'm honestly not sure how effective it'll be, but... Well, I told you to deal me in. And I've anted up a bit of my own will to show you how serious I am about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>There's been a lot of talk here about bearing burdens of responsibility and fighting for the future, and I feel like that's too big a job for just two people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Best make it an even three!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mikaboshi - Sumeragi</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ogre</td>
<td>Grrraaaaaarrrrrgghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Demons. Did they stray from the pack?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Worse. I think they picked up your scent and swarmed the cave. Which means this isn't a particularly safe hiding spot anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_mikabo.png" alt="Mikaboshi" height="128"><br>Mikaboshi</td>
<td>Well, I'm sorry to do this, fellow demons, but we still have a lot to take care of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/en_sumera.png" alt="Sumeragi" height="128"><br>Sumeragi</td>
<td>Yeah. It's a shame, but if you're gonna get in our way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mikaboshi - Sumeragi</td>
<td>...we'll just have to take you out!</td>
