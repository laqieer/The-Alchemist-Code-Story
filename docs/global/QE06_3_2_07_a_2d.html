<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I never thought I'd find you in a place like this. But...I probably should've figured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What are you doing here, Lady Mitsuha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Looking for you. Now come on. Let's go back to the castle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm sorry. We can't do that. We'd just create more problems for you to deal with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You worry about me far too much. Besides, it's been a greater ordeal for me not knowing where you two are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but we will not be returning with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Imagine if you were seen with us out here! What would people think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Is it so wrong for a parent to be seen with her children?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I remember a time when Koga spoke to me just like that. You really are your father's kids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But I know that your stubbornness comes from a place of love. You genuinely want what's best for me. And for that, I must thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's...not something deserving of your thanks. It's just normal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>How about this? Will you allow me to visit you every once in awhile?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Don't worry, I'll be careful. And I promise, I won't neglect my duties as queen. I just want to see you. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm sure it must have been hard out here by yourselves. But just know, I'm always here for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Now, would you be comfortable telling me what you've been up to since you left the castle? From the looks of things, you've been...busy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see. So you're saying our true enemy is the malice that lies in the heart of some unseen puppetmaster, and you've created a katana designed specifically to stand against that malice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah. I forged it from the kitchen knife left behind by Father, based on instructions he'd written in his recipe journal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I combined it with Mother's horn, too. But it's still not quite finished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Very interesting. Why a katana, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I didn't inherit demonic strength like Mikaboshi did, so I'm dependent on human ingenuity to make up for it. But according to Father, the combination of both is needed anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Because even if peace can be forged between humans and demons again, a one-sided peace could never last. Both sides need to contribute equally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And most importantly, the malice that led to all of this must be cleared away for good. It'll just keep sabotaging and undoing any peace efforts we might accomplish otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>All right. I think I understand. And I must say, this way of thinking is very...you, Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Even if we can't restore peace in our lifetime, this katana can be handed down to the next generation to keep the fight alive. I'm infusing my very will directly into its blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmm. So Wadatsumi can have its very own "spirit blade," then. I think there's a lot of potential in this idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I intend to realize that potential. I won't let this malice get the better of us. Not after what it's done to Mother and Father, to you, and to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Sumeragi has a much fiercer temperament than I do. But we're definitely on the same page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm not trying to be fierce. I just can't abide those who would actively seek to create misery for others. I can't allow that kind of thinking to go unchallenged...or unpunished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Father might not have had something like this in mind, but this is what we need to do. For ourselves and for you, Lady Mitsuha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Very nice. But don't think that just because you made some grand speech, I've forgotten how you used up our mother's horn without telling me! You're still a stupid jerk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Takes one to know one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's just no fair that you get to be the only one using that horn! I wanted to use it too! You never include me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Look, I said I'm sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hahahaha! So that's what you two were arguing about. And it's a good thing you were, or I might never have found you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But not to worry, Mikaboshi. Kaede had two horns, just like you. There was the one Sumeragi used, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Then there was this one, which she personally entrusted to me. Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Is it...okay for me to have this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Kaede would want you to, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>So this is...Mother's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Do you know how to use it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>To fulfill the will of my parents...and for Lady Mitsuha and Sumeragi, as well...I do hereby vow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I will do everything in my power to vanquish the malice that's overtaken this land!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Mikaboshi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I won't let it get the better of us either, Sumeragi. This malice is robbing everyone of their happiness...and I will hunt it down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Mother, lend me your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Why are you holding the horn straight up like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hyaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What?! Why would you stab yourself in the eye with it?! This isn't what I intended!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Mikaboshi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'm fine. You know I heal quickly because of my demonic blood, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's not the issue here! What are you thinking?! What's wrong with you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I just want to watch over everything—to see it all with unclouded vision. And this...is the proof of my resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I want to oversee everything, together with Mother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Mikaboshi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Incredible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It... It became another eye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Could Mikaboshi's demonic blood have somehow...reached out to Kaede's soul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Is that even possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It's the only explanation I've got, but even I have to admit, it stretches the bounds of reason. Maybe this is just a demon thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It's definitely not just a demon thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It doesn't matter what it is. As far as I'm concerned, Mother answered my wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>With this eye, I intend to root out every last bit of malice in the land. Nothing that means harm can evade my gaze.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>There can be no escape. I will behold all and track this malice to the ends of Babel, even if it kills me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Just seems a little unfair, if you ask me. I mean, I worked really hard to forge this sword, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I had no idea any of this was going to happen. It just kind of happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Don't give me that. You used your demon powers to show off again, like you always do! Stupid jerk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Who are you calling a stupid jerk?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Just paying you back for earlier. Anyway, I think it's time for us to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Hmph. Fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>But just remember, I see all now! And I'm going to be the one to track this malice down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yeah, and when you do, I'll cleave it in two with this sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>And together, we'll bring Wadatsumi back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Human and demon are reunited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I'm finally beginning to see it. It really might happen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>The future that Mother and Father envisioned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>By way of the present that Lady Mitsuha strives to defend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Even if it's impossible for one of us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...the two of us together will succeed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>We stake our lives on this will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Though it's not like I plan on getting killed all that easily, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Me neither!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>All right, deal me in. I give you my full support as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You aren't the only ones bearing heavy burdens right now. Plus, there's a little something I can do to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>That blade you forged, Sumeragi, and the eye you've formed,  Mikaboshi, may work a little differently than you're expecting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>So first, Sumeragi, I'd like you to set the blade down over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Uh, okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Hyaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Was that...Kagutsuchi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>The flames of Kagutsuchi will temper the blade. A fitting touch for a sword designed to cut through malice, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I'd say so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Just one forging won't suffice, though, so we'll take some time and work on it bit by bit. But before that, let's have a look at Mikaboshi's eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Nuh-uh! No way! Don't even think about blasting me in the face with Kagutsuchi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Relax. I'm not planning to do anything of the sort. Just get over here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>For you... Here we are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>It's warm. What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I guess you could say, it's a different application of Kagutsuchi. Another way of releasing the energy. Try pouring it over your eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I'm honestly not sure how effective it'll be, but... Well, I told you to deal me in. And I've anted up a bit of my own will to show you how serious I am about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>There's been a lot of talk here about bearing burdens of responsibility and fighting for the future, and I feel like that's too big a job for just two people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Best make it an even three!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Grrraaaaaarrrrrgghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Demons. Did they stray from the pack?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Worse. I think they picked up your scent and swarmed the cave. Which means this isn't a particularly safe hiding spot anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Well, I'm sorry to do this, fellow demons, but we still have a lot to take care of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Yeah. It's a shame, but if you're gonna get in our way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>...we'll just have to take you out!</td>
</tr>
