<td>001</td>
<td>We're not far from where the Philosopher's Stone is said to be, Lord Zahar. Quite exciting, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Philosopher's Stone... The key component required for the creation of the Sacred Darkstone. We still do not have enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>To realize my dream, we must follow every lead we can find. Let's hurry, Letitia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes, Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>"Throw off the chains the glitterati have laid upon thou and rise to be the King of Darkness."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>"For whom does the King of Darkness rise? For whom does the King of Darkness fight?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(The King of Darkness...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(A tragic dark elf king of ancient times. The light of our salvation.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(And also myâ€”)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Can't you even pour a decent cup of tea, you useless brat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What? How dare you glare at me like that, you filthy dark elf! Apparently you need be reminded of your place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Kneel. Now serve me. Your Alchemia disgusts me, but I will overlook your derelictions as long as you can satisfy my needs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Make it quick! This is the only thing you are good for, you useless swine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Agh! Ughh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Did I not say make it quick? I am a busy man. Ugh, how wretched your inferior breed can be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>My...apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(My heart was always full with the sense of resignation.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(I was a descendant of the traitorous dark elves. This was the price I had to pay for the foolish treachery of my ancestors.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(I was powerless against the legacy I had inherited from the past. There was nothing I could do but let the nature of this world carry me where it would.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(I thought nothing of those who let me languish in that position.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(The dark elves who sold me into slavery, the high-elves who abused me... None of them mattered.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Their witless, petty blades could never cut through the depths of the dark hollowness in me. The days simply passed me by.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(At least until that day.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You'll be the caregiver to that brat from now on. A perfect job for a lowborn such as yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes, my lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>My name is Letitia. I shall be your caregiver from today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It is nice to meet you, Zahar. I am only a little older than you, I hear. I could be your sister. Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Good morning, Zahar. Your breakfast is ready. Still reading, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Good morning, Letitia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Reading is all there is to do around here. I'm getting bored of it, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I've pretty much read through all the books in this room. It's more entertaining to talk to you, anyways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hehe, that's nice to hear. So, what shall we talk about today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Anything, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Anything? Well, is there anything that you'd like to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Well, I would like to learn more about this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, really? What sort of thing would you like to learn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Like I said, anything. I don't mind learning more about you, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If someone ever tried to hurt you... I would rise up and become the King of Darkness to save you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Zahar... Thank you. That's a promise, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yes. I promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(Why am I remembering the past all of a sudden? Could this be...apprehension?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(For Zahar? No, there's no way.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I don't mind an overcast sky, but I prefer not having my mind so clouded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Did you say something, Letitia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Nothing, Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I was just reminiscing over how long I've had the pleasure of working for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Where is this coming from all of a sudden? This is only the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hehehe, of course. You made a promise to me, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Indeed. For the sake of that promise, we need that Philosopher's Stone. Keep your mind in the present, Letitia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Of course. My apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(My wish, my purpose, the meaning of our meeting... Everything will come together soon.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Tsk! These small fries can be such a pain. Let's get rid of them, Letitia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yes, Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
