<td>Lust?</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Matters of love and romance are alien to me. I believe that they are unnecessary afflictions, even now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, then...why are you helping them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Why, indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Although burdened by the sin of lust, they have lived and fought, all while controlling its influence over them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>However, just in case their companionship should reveal itself to be something vulgar and crude, I am prepared to bring them down immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>They kinda already hit the lowest of the low, didn't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>They really did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Be that as it may, I felt like there was something to be achieved by playing along with that farce, and perhaps there still is. That's why I shall continue to merely observe...for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I don't know anything about love, either, but I'm pretty envious of the fact that you can fight with such discipline.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I can't help but leap into action, and it always gets me covered in scars and bruises from the get-go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why? Do you not care for your own appearance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tch... It's all because of my unreliable master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I need to get back... Not that I'm worried or anything, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What's that tone for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You are eager to meet your master, are you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I-it's not like that! It's just that I need to be there, to protect them! It's not like I care or anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What is it now? Why've you gone all quiet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Perhaps...she believes that your feelings are not so pure as you claim, but are in fact steeped in lust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?! No! It's not like that! I swear! Don't strike me! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hmhm. I am aware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Thank goodness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I understand what it is to want to protect one's master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>There is nothing wrong with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Heheh. Nyx. You've grown up so much, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry, Mira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It's fine, Hiiragi. I feel like I'm finally able to approve of your relationship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Th-that's not, um... Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Feel free to call me "sis."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>S-sis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Our little family has expanded!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Y-you're awfully happy about this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Now we've had confessions of love, a date between lovers, and Hiiragi has even been welcomed into her boyfriend's family. The Lovesickness should be pretty satisfied right about now, hey?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You've been thinking ahead all this time...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Half of it was just for kicks and giggles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>M-Mira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Like I said, just call me "sis"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Shouldn't be long now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>N-Nyx...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Ragi-Boo! Call me Nyxie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Aahh! I-I'm sorry, Nyx...ie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You're all mine now, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>U-um... Nyx? You really don't have to keep forcing yourself. The Lovesickness has calmed down now, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Heheh! Don't be silly, Ragi-Boo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We're just getting started.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>N-Nyx...? What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I wasn't talking to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Right, Ragi-Boo?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ooooooooraaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>But everything is turning out just as I thought it would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Th-the Lovesickness, it's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It's multiplying into lots and lots of...me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What the hell is going on here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? From the moment I saw you, I thought you were great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>H-huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I've never actually been in love with any of you. From the start, it was all just a ruse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Wh-what?! W-well, actually, I'm pretty relieved to hear that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The Lovesickness isn't my affliction, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Wh-whose...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ngh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I suppose it's about time I revealed my true purpose here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Jeez! You think you're so clever, don't you, little brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I'm going to make my very own Hiiragi Harem, right here, right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hiiragi...Harem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hiiragi Harem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hiiragi...H-Har...em?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>These lovely ladies are all mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>My little brother has lost his marbles!</td>
