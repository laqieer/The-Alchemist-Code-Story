</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Father</td>
<td>Oh, really? Security? Ah, I'm very sorry. My mistake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Father</td>
<td>Just, this is usually where the packages arrive, so I thought you must be working delivery...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Father</td>
<td>This isn't good at all. How am I supposed to win the contest if I can't even finish my sculpture... I was planning on giving the prize to my kid too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ishu.png" alt="Ishuna" height="128"><br>Ishuna</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>He isn't even listening...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lavi.png" alt="Ravina" height="128"><br>Ravina</td>

<td>It better! Cause we're gonna enter it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/loti.png" alt="Lotiyah" height="128"><br>Lotiyah</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ishu.png" alt="Ishuna" height="128"><br>Ishuna</td>
<td>What's that guy doing running off without his own kid?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lavi.png" alt="Ravina" height="128"><br>Ravina</td>
<td>Maybe he was so panicked he forgot?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Child</td>
<td>Papa said he's definitely going to win. I can't wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Child</td>
<td>The prize for the contest is goods from the Maruda Tribe. He knows how much I love them, so he's trying really hard to win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Child</td>
<td>He special ordered the decorations from a famous craftsman who lives in the forest. "I'll make the perfect snow sculpture! Just you watch!" he said...</td>

<td>Really!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lavi.png" alt="Ravina" height="128"><br>Ravina</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>Hm... I wonder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>I don't get it. Bears go out and hunt to bring things back for their cubs. Seems normal enough to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lavi.png" alt="Ravina" height="128"><br>Ravina</td>
<td>Um, bears?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ishu.png" alt="Ishuna" height="128"><br>Ishuna</td>
<td>You mean the dad just wants to make his son happy, right? I understand that, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lavi.png" alt="Ravina" height="128"><br>Ravina</td>
<td>How did you understand that!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ishu.png" alt="Ishuna" height="128"><br>Ishuna</td>
<td>But that boy looked so lonely. The holidays are supposed to be a happy time for children. His dad's going about it all wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>Oh, now I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lavi.png" alt="Ravina" height="128"><br>Ravina</td>
<td>Wow, you're pretty insightful, Ishuna. I had no idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>Ehehe, I told you she's amazing! An amazing pillow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ishu.png" alt="Ishuna" height="128"><br>Ishuna</td>
<td>Hey, come on. I was just trying to be understanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>Yep, you always are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ishu.png" alt="Ishuna" height="128"><br>Ishuna</td>
<td>Maybe instead of just congratulating me, you could try to be a little more understanding too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/loti.png" alt="Lotiyah" height="128"><br>Lotiyah</td>
<td>Hahaha, you guys are like two peas in a pod!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>Hehe</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ishu.png" alt="Ishuna" height="128"><br>Ishuna</td>
<td>*sigh* Anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ishu.png" alt="Ishuna" height="128"><br>Ishuna</td>
<td>That man mentioned something about decorations. They must be somewhere, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/loti.png" alt="Lotiyah" height="128"><br>Lotiyah</td>
<td>He said he ordered them from a famous craftsman in the forest. I think that's the same one that sells goods at the holiday market in the next town over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/loti.png" alt="Lotiyah" height="128"><br>Lotiyah</td>
<td>Maybe they got sent over there by mistake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lavi.png" alt="Ravina" height="128"><br>Ravina</td>
<td>It's certainly a possibility...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>...Got it. Then I'll head over there and check it out. Black and white bears are really fast, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ishu.png" alt="Ishuna" height="128"><br>Ishuna</td>
<td>Can you handle that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>Once the decorations are found and the snow sculpture is complete, everything will work out for the best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>You were the one who said it's our duty to protect the kids' smiles, Ishi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>So I'm gonna protect them. That's part of my duty as a guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ishu.png" alt="Ishuna" height="128"><br>Ishuna</td>
<td>I get the feeling it will take more than just finding the decorations to make that boy happy again, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/loti.png" alt="Lotiyah" height="128"><br>Lotiyah</td>
<td>I agree... But maybe once the snow sculpture is completed, his dad will relax a bit and have some time for his son.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/loti.png" alt="Lotiyah" height="128"><br>Lotiyah</td>
<td>And then they can just focus on having a happy holiday together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>It's settled then. I'll go look for the decorations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ishu.png" alt="Ishuna" height="128"><br>Ishuna</td>
<td>...You're really set on going, huh? You seem oddly eager to get out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>It's just your imagination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ishu.png" alt="Ishuna" height="128"><br>Ishuna</td>
<td>Is it...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lavi.png" alt="Ravina" height="128"><br>Ravina</td>
<td>Well if you're heading out there, I may as well accompany you. I've been to the holiday market before, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>Mer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lavi.png" alt="Ravina" height="128"><br>Ravina</td>
<td>What's with that look?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>Hmm, well alright. Since you're not an icky-sticky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lavi.png" alt="Ravina" height="128"><br>Ravina</td>
<td>An icky-sticky...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rache.png" alt="Rochelle" height="128"><br>Rochelle</td>
<td>You know, an icky-sticky. Those scary things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lavi.png" alt="Ravina" height="128"><br>Ravina</td>
<td>I, um... I guess I'll take that as a compliment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/loti.png" alt="Lotiyah" height="128"><br>Lotiyah</td>
<td>All right, then. You guys get going and we'll stay here and watch over the event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Just leave it to us! And Rochelle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
