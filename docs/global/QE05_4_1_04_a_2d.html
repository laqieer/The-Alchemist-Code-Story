<td>Ughh!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So? What is all this ruckus about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Uh, well... I tried to stop them, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I just didn't expect the fight to spread like wildfire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ah, this could partially be my fault. I was so concerned with gathering numbers that I didn't consider how best to organize the troops in the barracks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We are an army comprised of people from different backgrounds and upbringings. It wouldn't be at all surprising for a small dispute to turn into a fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I should have been more considerate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>How can this happen? They were fighting side by side only days ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's not that easy for people of different cultures to understand each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Once the enemy is out of sight, all we can see is what we don't like about the person standing right beside us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Especially now, as we prepare ourselves for the battle to come, the charged air can easily cause a fight to erupt among the ranks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm sorry. That mood must have gotten to me as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Still no sign of Mocca or the Blue Tongues?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Nah. They shouldn't be too far away, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Unlike in Saga, the voice of Mother Nature is faint here in the desert. I can't sense their trail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Regardless, we are going to have to do something to boost the troops' morale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Perhaps we should do something to help the troops relieve their stress?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What can we do? It's not like we can just give them time off or anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Come to think of it... If they have so much pent up energy, should we not just let them fight it out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
