<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I thank you for rescuing us. If you hadn't come, who knows what would've happened to both us and our weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm sorry to hear about Count Maldini, but I'm sure he would've been pleased to know that some of his troops survived, though, however few.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>A thousand thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>General Vlad, this is the power of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'll acknowledge it's strength. However, Alchemy is a power best avoided. A battle where one does not risk their lives...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>When has such chivalry changed the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Resolve yourself, General.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Whether what we use the Forbidden Art or not...unless we win in the end, nothing will change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ack! Do you understand what you're saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The cause of the war that devastated Wratharis 17 years ago was Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So, in order to avoid repeating history, you want us to stand against their mighty Alchemy with only our blades?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heheh. That will be quite some act of chivalry, General.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You insolent...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>During these 17 years, while you've remained paralyzed by fear, how many people do think have lost their lives?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>After the Dawn of Wrath, this kingdom came under the rule of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Over these 17 years, Envylia has governed us with repeated acts of exploitation and repression!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No longer able to grow crops in our war-starved land, we can't even sustain ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yet, we must pay the heavy taxes imposed on us by the nobles of Envylia, causing our livelihood to grow heavier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The streets fill with beggars; our people kill one another to eat; and those who can work continue to abandon our country!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Listen, that's the reality of Wratharis! At this rate, if we do nothing, the people of Wratharis will inevitably perish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>With our resources and people on the verge of exhaustion, do you think we have the luxury of fighting among ourselves?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We've got to do the most we can with our limited power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's true; the power of the Philosopher's Stones is dangerous. If we don't have enough Alchemia stored, we compensate with our lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But, if we have the Philosopher's Stones, we can change our determination into power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We are willing to sacrifice our lives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We'll use this determination as fuel to fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>General, please give it some thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Sabareta has ceaselessly pursued Alchemy for this day,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>to provide us with enough power to launch a counterattack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'll say it once again. General, we need your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>To further strengthen the resolve of all here, I want to revive the Deadly Trio of Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What? The Deadly Trio?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>During the Dawn of Wrath, the Deadly Trio was the beacon of hope for the people of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>With the power of Alchemy, I want you to resurrect the Deadly Trio and give our people the courage to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Impossible! Are you talking about Caesar and Neville?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Take the Stone, General Vlad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Now is the time for the world to know the power of Wratharis's Deadly Trio!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...!</td>
