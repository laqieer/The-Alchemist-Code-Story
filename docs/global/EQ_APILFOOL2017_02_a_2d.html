<td>Phew...I'm so hungry! Today's shift is...oh, I lucked out! It's the Apple Garden! I'm gonna eat lots of apples!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Forests that have apples have a high concentration of Alchemia. That's why special apples grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>In order to protect these special apples from being over-picked...</td>

<td>Hey, Metal Ratty!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Numa!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh?</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Numa, numa!</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I didn't know that's how you spell a Ratty's cry.</td>

<td>That's what the sound director says, so it must be correct. Hmm. I see...</td>

<td>Numa.</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh, sorry. Went off on a bit of a tangent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The Ratty clans are the ones who protect this forest. If you really get careless here, people are gonna abuse it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Numa, numa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I mean, it's humans that are gonna suffer if they abuse the forest and they can no longer get apples, right?</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Numa, numa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're so cute and even hats look good on you guys, but you're always being hated on and called annoying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Numa, numa, numa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>For starters, you guys are supposed to be cute mascots that've been around since the beginning of the Ratty clans. I can't believe they haven't made a single piece of merchandise after you guys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yeah, totally...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If you're going to say that, the Rattys at least stand a chance because they're cute...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We look this way, right? Merchandise is just a dream that'll never happen for us...sigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Numa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Are you trying to cheer me up? Thanks...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Numa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Whew. They've already come before we could eat. All right, let's start work.</td>
