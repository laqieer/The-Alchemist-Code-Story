<td>Are we going to practice here today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No. After what happened last time, I've given it some thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The reason why your performance may be taking a while to improve is that the size of the instrument may not suit you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The...size?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You and I have noticeably different body sizes, Melia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I realized that it might difficult for you to play an instrument that has been made to fit my body size, so...ah, here it is now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, if it isn't Gato? What's the matter? Are you already going to acquire a new instrument for yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No. Today we are here to choose one for her. Melia, this is the peddler I often procure musical instruments from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, an instrument for this kid?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There are a lot of different kinds...both large and small! Oh, this instrument is beautiful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>True. It's a fine specimen, however...it's also too big for you, Melia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I believe this one suits you better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sigh... But this one over here is more...beautiful. Are you sure I won't be able to play it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmm. Well, it is too large in size for you, but do you like it that much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hmm... I feel like it's somewhat counterintuitive, but it may be best to use the instrument you've taken a liking to the most.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Then can I use this one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. We'll take this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Great doing business with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well then, try and do your best with that instrument today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Eheheh. I'm so happy with this instrument!</td>
