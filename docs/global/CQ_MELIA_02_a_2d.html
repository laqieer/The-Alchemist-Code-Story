<td>Oh, an instrument for this kid?</td>

<td>True. It's a fine specimen, however...it's also too big for you, Melia.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/gath.png" alt="Gato" height="128"><br>Gato</td>
<td>I believe this one suits you better.</td>

<td>Hmm. Well, it is too large in size for you, but do you like it that much?</td>

<td>Yes...!</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/gath.png" alt="Gato" height="128"><br>Gato</td>
<td>Hmm... I feel like it's somewhat counterintuitive, but it may be best to use the instrument you've taken a liking to the most.</td>

<td>Then can I use this one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/gath.png" alt="Gato" height="128"><br>Gato</td>

<td>Great doing business with you!</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/gath.png" alt="Gato" height="128"><br>Gato</td>
<td>Well then, try and do your best with that instrument today.</td>
