<td>Ack...!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...! Watch out, Sharon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Graaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...Huaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Phew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Are you okay, Sharon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...Like I’ve already told you, I’m fine. There is no way I’d lose to these goblins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No matter who my opponents are, I will win. Otherwise, there is no point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hey, so I was thinking... That Greatsword might not be the best match for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I thought so during the bout earlier...and I still think so. It doesn’t seem like it’s the right size for your body...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sometimes it’s like the Greatsword is swinging you around instead, and it creates a weakness. Maybe you should use a smaller sword until you’ve gotten the hang of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...I will master it soon enough. I was entrusted with this sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You might have your reasons, but a weakness on the battlefield could mean losing your life in an instant. So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Is that something an instructor should be saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes, that’s right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...Those words have zero impact coming from someone who doesn’t even have the resolve to hurt others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That’s...ah, ahaha! But I truly am worried about you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That’s the signal for the end of drills. Let’s head back for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes...hm? Are those...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(...Soldiers from Wratharis? What are they doing here?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Sharon, is something wrong? Let’s head back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hey!<br>We’re back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Welcome back. ...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Bertha... Are you alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What are you saying? Sharon is right... Wait, she’s gone! When did that happen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Does that mean she went off on her own?! How selfish is she?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...I hope she’s not in danger though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This is bad! I have to search for her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Wait! She went off on her own, right? This isn’t your responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>She’ll come back eventually. We’ll probably meet up sooner if we just wait here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I can’t do that... I haven’t been able to do anything for her yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...Bertha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Sometimes she looks like she’s thinking too much. Like she’s suffering... I can’t just leave her alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I know I’m not suited to be an instructor. I don’t even have the resolve to hurt others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But I have to go looking for her. She reminds me of myself when I was younger...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Not to mention...I’m her instructor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wait, Bertie! ...Uggh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Is Bertha okay? She doesn’t seem her usual composed self.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yeah. Those two are actually a lot alike.</td>
