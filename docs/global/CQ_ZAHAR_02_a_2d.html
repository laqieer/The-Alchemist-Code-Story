<td>Captain Zahar, your strategy has succeeded. It appears that the enemy has endured over 80% in casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This battle is certainly ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(Certainly...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(If their army suffered 80% in causalities, then that means we were defeated by the remaining 20%.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(That red-headed man, who was he? Was his power alone enough to change the flow of the battle?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey, did you bring the artifacts I specified here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What? Yes, Captain, as you commanded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Numerous valuable artifacts from this area have been moved to this church in order to escape the fires of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Very well then. Rest and prepare for tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It seems everything is here. From what I can see, 80% of this is made by Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(How ironic. It's the same as today's battle.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This Mage Bottle...it's made by Decel of Envylia. Who would've thought it would end up in some god forsaken place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It truly is worthy of its historical significance. Its beauty stands out from the rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Heheh. It's almost as if it were that redhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What kind of voice will you cry out with? Let me hear your distress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Craccckkk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Heheh...mwahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The most beautiful things are also the most beautiful when they are destroyed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No two exist in this world. I will witness the moment that I destroy its existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This is the highest pleasure that has been provided to the chosen. The powerful are the ones who rewrite history!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I will eliminate everything that stands in my way and bring myself closer to perfection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Just watch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>In tomorrow's battle, I will render you to dust, you red-headed man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You will fall by my hands.</td>
