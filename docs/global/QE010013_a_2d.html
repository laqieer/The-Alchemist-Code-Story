<td>Where did the two of you learn the forbidden power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The other day, at Fort Aldrin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>W-we...were planning on telling you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You both know what this power is, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's an art forbidden under the Magna Code, established by the Alliance of the Seven Kingdoms of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A strictly forbidden art, permitted only to be used by the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's not what I mean. Alchemy was the cause for Wratharis's collapse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's a power that can bring a kingdom to destruction; I'm asking you if you understand the meaning of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Bu-but, we have no intention of exploiting this power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What do you plan to use it for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I plan to use it to protect people without power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I plan to use it to change this world filled with sorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My children have now also seen the Door of Truth. Is this fate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The Door of Truth? Father, why do you know that place?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Listen. The heart of man is weak by nature. If you do not stay strong, you will be consumed instantly by the power; as I was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>There is no time for us to wait for the Holy Guard. If it's to combat the Alchemy-wielding rebel army, then we've no other choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Swear to me that you will never allow yourself to be swallowed up by your power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I swear, dad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes!Â I swear never to lose myself to this power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Very well. Let's cut through the forest. We're going to make a run for the Gilrack Ruins.</td>
