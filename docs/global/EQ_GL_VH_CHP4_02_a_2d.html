<td>Eliza closes the report on her lap before shutting her eyes in frustration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>How hard could it possibly be to catch two rats?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How did they even make it out of the city?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Y-Yes, my Queen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I do not care if you turn all of Slothstein upside down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Exit records. Eyewitnesses. All of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I want them. NOW.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Y-YES MA'AM!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'd wager you'd find better success allocating forces to the borders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>With all due respect, I doubt they would be so eager to return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Not without a good reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A dead woman need not remain strictly...dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...You mean the Broker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Dangle the promise of her capture before them and they will come running.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Any thoughts of their "plans" would be thrown out the window, if you make it sound desperate enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hmm. Not a bad idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Your right-hand woman. The one with the bow. Godslayer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Have her head the border patrol. And even should her tongue slip in a fit of pride, they would find it difficult to stay away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Like moths to a flame, Queen. These hero-types rarely leave a comrade unavenged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>As we discussed, I will inform you once my preparations are complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We likely will only have the one chance. Keep that in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I don't need telling twice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Inform Godslayer of her new mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>*sigh*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I can't let that Li Wang get another step ahead of me.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Can't believe I got myself a second boss outta nowhere... This sucks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Maybe I should go pay Red a visit. Looks like it's gonna be a long mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Sis...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Heya. How're you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well, I don't blame you. This is such a tiny cell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Anyway, I came to tell you I'm going on a mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Probably for quite a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Some guy from headquarters came down and started bossing Queen around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>She's a brat but...even I don't like when she's upset.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Just means we get the short end of her temper, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hey, you're really quiet. Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Sis, do you know who you are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh? Where did that come from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Red only stares quietly at Lilith from the corner of her cell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hah. Well. Not all of us have a choice in being here, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>In Goetia, you...don't get to decide who you are. I'm sure you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...Thank you, Sis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>See you later, Red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>- Slothstein Borders -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(Damn, a patrol!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We got this. There's more in the area, so get behind cover as soon as you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Be careful out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>We will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>A swift, charged arrow plants itself at Siegfried's feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Wait. Isn't this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Why am I not surprised it would be you two?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Should've known this wasn't going to be a cushy job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>On your guard. They call her 'Godslayer', and for good reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What a name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I don't think you're here just to shoot the breeze, but whatever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Wait a minute. I know you. You're that guy Nesha was sent to chase.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>She did say she was sad she didn't get to torment that girl of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What did you do with Roxanne?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You know, if I could tell you right away I wouldn't be standing here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>If you had her, Goetia would be making demands for an exchange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Haven't we eluded you long enough? Why search in vain when you could cut a deal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Beats me. I just do whatever I'm told. That includes putting an arrow through your thick skull, if it came down to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Well, let's get down to it then.</td>
