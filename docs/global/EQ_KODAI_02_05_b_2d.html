<td>With bad aim like that, you'll never hit me between my brows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>You're strong. I can't bother aiming like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>So I'm waiting for you to become exhausted. Once you're weakened, then I'll kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/math.png" alt="Matia" height="128"><br>Matia</td>
<td>So your plan is to not even fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>It's like hunting. The plan is the same whether the target is weak or strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>Follow it to its death. Let it run. And finally, off with its head.</td>
</tr>

<td>…!</td>

<tr>

<tr>

<td>Aedith!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Is this what you want? By being pushed back, there's no way to negotiate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Are you willing to lose everything including your dragon power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Ugh…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/shah.png" alt="Shahel" height="128"><br>Shahel</td>
<td>There is no need. Schmeier was injured during the escape.</td>

<td>At this point, it's impossible for her to turn into a dragon.</td>

<td>…</td>

<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>(Dammit! I can't bluff my way out of this one!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>This is…turning out worse than I imagined…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/math.png" alt="Matia" height="128"><br>Matia</td>
<td>We should retreat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>I was thinking the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>You think I'll let you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Our opponents are only human. This should do it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Hm? What's this round…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>…!</td>

<tr>

<tr>

<td>Alright! The finger's off the trigger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/math.png" alt="Matia" height="128"><br>Matia</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/math.png" alt="Matia" height="128"><br>Matia</td>
<td>Apologies. We'll meet again, Aedith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>H-hey, wait! Urgh…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>Aedith, are you alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Yeah. Got hit in the hip but I'm alright. But you… After those two…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>We can't. They got away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Dammit…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>Although that beautiful looking one…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Hm? Oh, the high elf. Don't worry. He's just a terminal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>A terminal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>He has multiple body forms to choose and use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>So he was being "controlled?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Ugh… We'll take that down that woman, that Schmeier with our own hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Otherwise, the dragon army will wipe out the Sloth Layer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>And that Matia… Always bringing trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Hm? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>Looks like you're enjoying this, Aedith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Stop it, my angel. Everything that I put so much work into is about to fall apart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>Yup… I'm done with ridiculous journeys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>I decided to spend the rest of my life relaxing in this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>Yes. Well, though it is no concern for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>That's fine. An assassin wanting to show his skills to someone will inevitably lead to the other's death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>Yes…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aedith</td>
<td>So, about those two that escaped. We'll follow their trail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><img src="../img/backgrounds/bg251.png" alt="bg251"></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>So… where do we run to next?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/math.png" alt="Matia" height="128"><br>Matia</td>
<td>Now that Aedith has turned against us, there is no safe place in this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/math.png" alt="Matia" height="128"><br>Matia</td>
<td>Even the friendly innkeeper would report us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Then… We must leave the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/math.png" alt="Matia" height="128"><br>Matia</td>
<td>But that would mean staying in the fields or in the few forests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/math.png" alt="Matia" height="128"><br>Matia</td>
<td>Continuously hiding and escaping will be difficult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Then, where…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/math.png" alt="Matia" height="128"><br>Matia</td>
<td>Of course, if we can't stay above the ground, then there is the option for below…</td>
