<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Y-you...! What you doing?! Hurry up and finish him off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No. I already fulfilled my end of the agreement. I've no reason to follow your instructions anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What?! Y-you! What's that in your hand...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I knew you were after this toy. That's why, well, I thought that if I were in your good graces, it'll help me save considerable time and effort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>S-since when...? We-were you in on this since the beginning?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hardly. I'm not that much of a straight shooter. Just on the way back to your mansion, I managed to squeeze myself into the role.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That being said, I'm surprised you actually let a Guard Droid loose on the streets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You really are a bad person. I was smart to put you in my list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>All the treasure that you've accumulated for yourself will be put to good use, so don't worry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hey! That's my collection! You...you scum!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Chaaat Nooooir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hey, Justinâ™ª I truly do appreciate all your hard work. Thanks to you, I was able to really enjoy my work today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Also...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Thank you for repairing it properly. It helped a lot, lady. But it was a pretty exciting experience, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes, it was. Perhaps fate will bring us together again, Chat Noir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well then, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed today's show. An encore will not be necessary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You're not going to chase him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>There's something more important for me to do first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Th-that brat! What are you doing?! Hurry up and catch him! Get me back my fortune!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You are guilty of having made a Guard Droid go on a rampage and of attacking a toy shop. You are a criminal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>One day, I will catch him with my own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>However, in order to succeed, I must not allow the evil in front of me to escape. That would go against my justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ugh...you...you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...Sigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh? How uncharacteristic of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Anyone would want to sigh in this situation. This is the 718th time he's gotten away...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You two really have a long relationship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>An unwilling one...that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What about you? Why are you cooperating with Chat Noir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Personally, I have a hard time seeing the kid as a bad person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Just like the kid who couldn't get the toy he wanted at the toy shop, I see him as a kid who wants something he can't obtain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Taking from the proud and giving to the weak...sometimes that is the most direct way to save people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I believe that there are some forms of justice where this is absolutely necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But still, I truly believe in creating a world where one day everyone can live justly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>After all, that...is my justice! That's why!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Heheh. Not the most eloquent way to put it...but I'm looking forward to seeing the results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I fixed it...just like I promised, old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>O-oh...is that so? Who would've thought there was someone in this town who could fix it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>This toy has a special mechanism incorporated within it. It's a piece that has been lost and does not exist anywhere...and yet you were able to fix it in such a short period of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The technology that my brother left behind was indeed inherited...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Well then, will you keep your end of the promise? Tell me about the hidden side of Babel that would never appear in its history... "the sunken city where light does not reach"...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That evil land that was sunk by your younger brother...the place they call Lost Blue.</td>
