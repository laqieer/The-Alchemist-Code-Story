<td>A highly stimulating substance, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alex.png" alt="Alexis" height="128"><br>Alexis</td>
<td>It worked too effectively on the children and created a poisoning effect, so to speak. Well, it's nothing severe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>That explains everything. I guess it was a little too early for children to dabble with that kinda stuff.</td>
