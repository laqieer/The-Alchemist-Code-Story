<td>Owww... Ahhhh! I'm bleeeeding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Eeeeeeeek! So-sooooo scary! Don't look at me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wh-who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh? Hello, folks. Nice costumes. I'm Alexis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Uhh, you're not a ghost? Your face is incredibly frightening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You know... With all the costumes and fights going on, Halloween is pretty darn amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Y-you're pretty scary. What are you even trying to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>My sincere apologies. When it comes to Halloween, I'm what they call something of a newbie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Eeeeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't laugh with that face! It's honestly frightening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>More importantly... What were you doing to the children of the town with those injections?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Children? Oh, are you referring to the children who I found collapsed and sleeping in the middle of the woods?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, as you can see, I'm a doctor, so—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I thought it was strange that they were passed out in the outskirts of the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Having diagnosed them, they appear to have ingested a weak poison.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Elizabeth...you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No way! It shouldn't be harmful! At least when it comes to adults...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh... Did you make those sweets?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Indeed, the substances pose no risk of harm for an adult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>E-exactly! I only used things that weren't harmful to the body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>However...when consumed by a child, it becomes a highly stimulating substance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>A highly stimulating substance, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It worked too effectively on the children and created a poisoning effect, so to speak. Well, it's nothing severe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That explains everything. I guess it was a little too early for children to dabble with that kinda stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(Please, don't get Mia any more worked up.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Thus...I was injecting children with a relief agent while making my way to town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm sorry for the inconvenience. I'm glad things didn't get out of hand. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You're a good person, Mr. Grim Reaper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...Still, that costume is way too terrifying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Aww, really? Is it? Heheh. I heard that Halloween was this kind of event, so I sort of went all out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm not complimenting you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Mmm... Anyway, we've managed to complete our mission safely, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yeah, we've finished distributing the sweets long ago, and we've solved the problems we encountered. I guess all's well that ends well. I'm going home to sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>All's well that ends well? Well, I've never participated in the town's Halloween festivities, so I'll be on my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>In fact, I'm very much looking forward to participating... Tee hee hee...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>U-um... Ma-maybe it'll be better if you removed some of your makeup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Eeeek! You're too close! Don't look at me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Jeez...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>After the candy has been handed out and the case of the collapsing children solved...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The town's Halloween spirit reaches its peak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Meanwhile, in some areas, reported incidences of spontaneous screaming continue to persist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Most were said to have been caused by Alexis's smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td><br>Happy ★ Halloween!</td>
