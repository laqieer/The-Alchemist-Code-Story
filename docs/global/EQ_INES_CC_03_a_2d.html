<td>These are the accommodations we've prepared for you. Please, make yourselves at home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wow... What a lovely room!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The trees are so warm and inviting. It really feels just like the forest! I think we'll be very comfortable with these lodgings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Indeed, for a human room, it's...not bad at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm glad it meets with your approval. I requested some adjustments to its design so it would better appeal to such...elite clientele as yourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I've also prepared all the items you might need for the festival right here:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There's the incense wood for the fire, holy water to purify yourselves, a bowl for dipping the cloth into the holy water, a plate for catching the ashes of the incense wood, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You prepared this much? But I already brought everything with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Nasario, you should have forewarned me of Northern Pride's hospitality! There would have been far less baggage to contend with on our journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm as surprised as you. Northern Pride guides do traditionally prepare for the festival just as we do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But generally not to this extent! And as we've never had any shortages on our end, there's never been any need to request or expect such assistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Considering the nature of the ritual, I felt some degree of thoroughness was necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The festival is to mourn those humans and high elves who were lost in our past conflicts, and to ensure we don't make those same mistakes again in the future...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So it stood to reason that if we didn't accommodate your needs as much as possible, you might not be as inclined to take our hands in friendship this time around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I am surprised and humbled by how far ahead you've thought on this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I want to do as much as I can, but I worry that even this may still not be enough...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Such worry is unfounded, I assure you. It's beyond impressive how much you've done already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Until our arrival, you ensured our safety by concealing our elven nature from passers-by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And when meeting with your elders, it was clear they were scared of us, despite your deft attempts to recontextualize their reactions and hurry us through to our rooms...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...which you did because I wasn't feeling well after the long carriage ride, I presume.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm sorry for making this more difficult than it already must have been for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. Being surrounded by so many people you've never met can be overwhelming. I'm sure I'd have felt a bit ill in that situation as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ines?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I just can't understand why you're doing so much for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I've always been afraid of humans, if I'm being honest. And I haven't exactly taken the warmest attitude toward you thus far, Claris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ines...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If I too am being honest, I understand where you're coming from all too well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The truth is, I was once afraid of high elves, myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yes. There were no high elves for me to interact with, of course, and my grandfather would only tell me stories of how strong and fearsome you all are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It didn't occur to me until later in life that, as the family representative entrusted with guiding you, I would need to learn to respect the dignity of the high elves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Until I realized as such, I was afraid of your kind, and wanted nothing to do with the festival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Even when I was first recruited to help with its preparations, I was scared to the point that I would cry if I messed up anything at all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But then I saw the magic of the high elves with my own two eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>And I was taken aback by its stunning beauty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I wanted to know more about that beautiful magic, and suddenly, I went from avoiding everything high elf-related...to obsessing over learning everything I could about your people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Your history and culture, your ancestral magic, and your forest that you hold so dear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The more I learned, the more my fear of you began to simply fade away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That's when I realized that in all things, fear is birthed by the unknown, and defeated through knowledge—a credo I've come to live by ever since.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Defeated through knowledge... That's a rather poignant turn-of-phrase, I must say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Admittedly, though, when I started to seriously aim for this position, the studying was...intense, to say the least. There was more to know than I was prepared for, and I nearly gave up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Memorizing all the proper etiquette, exact procedures, and all the other small details associated with this sort of ambassadorial work is no small feat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, I definitely know exactly what you mean, believe me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Don't exaggerate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But just as I was about to throw in the towel, I met someone—a truly wonderful high elf woman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Did you, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>She'd come all the way from your forest to the capital for the festival, just as you have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>And though I was but a little girl at the time, she listened intently to my frustrations, and even re-enacted the festival with me so I could better understand what I was studying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'm pretty sure Mother prayed like this next, and then... Hmm... How'd the next part go again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Uh, I think...that's when the human representative presents the crown to the high elf representative, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ohh, yes! You got it! That's exactly right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>That's perfect, then. How about giving it a try with the flower crown we made?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>O-okay! Let's see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Oh, very smooth! Your studies are paying off, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>If I'm going to be the next representative for my people, I'm going to have to study a lot harder myself. And I really don't like studying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I don't like it much either. I wish I could just...know stuff, without having to study it. But I'm surprised to hear that kind of thing from a high elf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It makes no difference whether you're a high elf or a human! Studying is boring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But now I'm really motivated! Tell you what. If you come to see the festival again next time, then I'll make sure I'm totally ready for it too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>So you keep studying real hard, okay? Promise me! Let's shake on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Okay! I promise! I'll do my very best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>To this day, I still remember her friendly face, and the warmth of her gentle hand as I presented that flower crown to her...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>That's when I discovered that high elves have the same warm hands as humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>A crown of flowers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>There are still so many things I need to learn, though. But that just makes me even more excited!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>For instance... Here, look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Wow! It's beautiful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I feel...strangely nostalgic? What a nice, warm feeling this is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Magic borrowed from the spirits? Those of us who live in the forest certainly are no strangers to such things, but this is an altogether different kind of magic than that of the high elves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>And I must admit, I've never heard of the spirits helping humans with magic to such an extent. I believe your talent must be exceptionally rare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I've also studied the spirits themselves. It's that knowledge which allows me to do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Magic can be quite terrifying, but if you understand it well enough, you can easily lighten another's mood with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>It's like I said: knowledge defeats fear. The more you know, the less there is to be scared of, and the more fun you'll have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Excuse me, Lady Claris? The festival committee wishes to speak with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Understood. I'm on my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Now then, you two. A servant is at your disposal in the next room, so if you need anything, please don't hesitate to ask.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I can't believe how hard she studied to become a festival guide. Claris truly is an amazing person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I...am inclined to agree. Preparing all of this is not something one can just learn to do overnight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Fear is birthed by the unknown...and defeated through knowledge...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>There's still so much I don't know about humans. I wonder if anything would change were I to learn more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Ines...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I know. Remaining afraid of them will do no one any good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>High elves and humans must never fight again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>For us to take one another's hands and peacefully coexist, I swear to protect our oath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Just like Mother did in the previous festival...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>The previous festival...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Nasario?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Ah, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I thought I'd survey the area just to be safe, and what do I find? So tell me. What do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>You... You're a high elf, but you don't seem to be the representative. Either way, though, you're coming with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>How rude! It seems there's no getting along with you lowly humans after all. Perhaps the error was mine in thinking we ever could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>(I can't let these people near Ines. I'll need to hold them off myself!)</td>
</tr>
