<td>W-wow, I can taste the excitement in the air. So, this is Halloween...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Whoa! It's even more extravagant than last time! Hey, look! The decorations are amazing as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Come on, kids. Getting carried away is fine and all, but we're technically here to work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I-I'm not getting carried away! I was merely identifying exactly what Halloween is for security purposes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>After all, my mission is to protect everyone during this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wow, that's quite some dedication you've got there. Well then, I've got a very important mission for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>A very important mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Woohoo! There's so much excitement in the air! I wonder if anyone here would be willing to drink this new medicine of mine♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hehehe. The mere thought of participating in Halloween again this year...makes me tremble with excitement...heheh...hahaha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You two! We're here on a mission today! Don't forget! ...Especially you, Elizabeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah. Gotcha! After all, last time was pretty crazy... We'll need to keep our guard up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yes...of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>These are the very perpetrators responsible for the previous ruckus. That's why I've taken the preemptive measure of hiring them as security.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Our job is to ensure a fun Halloween! So, Hayate, you must absolutely never take your eyes off of those two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So that's how it is. Do your best, Hayate. We want to avoid problems at all cost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I feel like I'm kind of being forced into this job, but...fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>All right! Leave it to me! I'll defend Halloween until the bitter end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>By the way, where is the crucial candy that we're supposed to distribute to everyone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh, I left that to Neica! She's supposed to be back soon, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We could just buy candy around here. Why did you have to ask Neica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well, I thought it would be better if it was homemade. Halloween only comes once a year, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You know how skilled Neica is, right? Just look at the accessories she made! I was sure she'd be good at making candy as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh! That sounds so fun! I want to make some candy too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Absolutely not, Elizabeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Speaking of which...Neica still hasn't returned yet. I wonder what's going on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's true. She's a little late... Magnus, let's go check on Neica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Fine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>All right! Time to begin securing the area!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Waaaaah! It hurts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Come on! It's your own fault!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hey, kids! Stop fighting! How can you fight during a festival that everyone's supposed to enjoy...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh dear, are you hurt? Are you okay? Do you want me to apply some special medicine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hey, Elizabeth! Stop! Put away that shady medicine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Gyaaah! The grim reaper!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hey! Alexis! Don't go ahead on your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This year's security detail is such a sweet-looking boy! How nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I wish I could give him some candy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...Huff...huff. I-I'm getting quite the workout...but I was entrusted with this mission! I need to see it through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Being security detail really is tiring, isn't it? Oh, that's right! Hayate, would you like to drink this energy drink?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It'll give you a real boost! Although your tanuki ears will, unfortunately, turn into rabbit ears...oh no, it's wolf ears today♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hey, security! Come this way! These kids dressed up as monsters are causing a ruckus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What is it this time?! Seriously...come on, let's go!</td>
</tr>
