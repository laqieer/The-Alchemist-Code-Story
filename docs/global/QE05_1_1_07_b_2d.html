<td>Your armor is different from that of the guards in the royal capital. Are you all from the rebel army?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We are no rebels! We are the Liberation Army of the South!</td>

<td>Ceclidis, that dog! I never would have thought he'd really convince the Holy Guard to work for him!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Can you not see that this is merely a pretext to give him an excuse to interfere with our domestic affairs?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmmm. There seems to have been a misunderstanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Our purpose here is to prevent the abuse of Alchemy. We have no intention of interfering with your affairs.</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You expect us to believe that?!</td>

<td>We have completed disarming the rebels, sir!</td>

<td>Good work. Now, all of you may go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We cannot allow you to have your weapons back, but this should be plenty of food and water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Go back to your camp or quit the war; do as you wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You're letting us go? What are you playing at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I told you. We do not intend to get involved with your affairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We are scouts and nothing more. We have no interest in involving ourselves in any kind of combat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Really...? We thought you lot were reinforcements for the Royal Army assaulting the harbor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wait, the Royal Army is assaulting the harbor? Why would they be attacking their own country's center of commerce?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You did not know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The harbor is under attack by the Third Legion at General Ceclidis' command.</td>
