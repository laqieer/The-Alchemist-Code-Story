</tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>You certainly do get into it. But how fun can it really be to make medicines and treat people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Oh, that's easy. It's fun to see them recover because of my medicine, of course! The fun is in knowing that I'm responsible for making then feel good again.</td>

<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>And putting them to use is better still! Then whenever I see someone start perking up, I try to imagine what else I can do for them. It's...exhilarating, frankly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>No wonder you always look so happy when you're treating people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Exactly. I had lots of fun when I was tending to you, too, Margaret. It was my medicine that was able to bring you right back from death's door, after all. Can you even imagine how gratifying that was?</td>

</tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Purple Cacao? But isn't that dangerous to eat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Peddler</td>
<td>Oh, it'll hurt after you eat it, to be sure! But that just proves how potent it is. And if you want to become a powerful witch—and I know you do—well, it's like they always say: no pain, no gain!</td>

<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>

</tr>
