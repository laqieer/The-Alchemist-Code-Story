<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Ugh, I really hate pushy customers. Take it up with management, you brute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Margaret, watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wha— Aaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Margaret! Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Owww... Sorry. I should've been more careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why did you charge on ahead by yourself? You usually fight alongside me. Please, just tell me what's on your mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh, um... Haha. Just, everything that's been happening. I guess I got lost in reflection. It's nothing to worry about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Let me see your wounds. Oh, dear me, this looks quite bad. Let's just use a little dab of this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Owwww! Gah, Lizzy, that hurts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>With a wound like that, of course it does!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That monster's saliva is poisonous, so we need to be very careful here. This medicine should help neutralize it. I think...about this much should do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Aaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Nnngh... That really hurts... Which is fine—I will endure any pain for your sake—but can't you at least try to be a little gentler?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hehehe! Look, Margaret. Your cut's fizzing and bubbling; that means the treatment is working! It should heal up in no time at all now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You seem to be having fun. I'm glad I had a chance to be your test subject.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I...really am glad, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(I guess I have just been a lab rat for her all this time. Or I would've been, if she'd had more opportunities to actually experiment on me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(But what if she's just saving me up until she has something really big she wants to test out?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hey, Margaret?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Maybe she really does get a sort of sick thrill out of experimenting on people who've fallen gravely ill or gotten themselves injured...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Margaret? Hello?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(But that doesn't change the fact that she saved me! Even still...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tuning me out again, are you? All right, Margaret, face this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Here, open up. Down the hatch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hrmpff?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(Ack, what did she just give me?! I knew it; she really does just think of me as a guinea pig! I mean, if that's what she truly desires, that's what I'll be, but—)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wait... This is sweet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Of course it is. It's chocolate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Chocolate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>From the contraband that girl bought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What?! But that chocolate's made from Rainbow Cacao! Isn't it dangerous?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>There's no need to worry. Based on my analysis, a tiny piece like that won't cause any harm whatsoever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>In fact, it should do quite the opposite! A small dose of Blue and Purple Cacao should help calm your nerves. So? How do you feel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oh... Now that you mention it, I do feel considerably less tense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hehe! Perfect! Rainbow Cacao truly is fascinating, in so many ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I realized when I was studying it earlier that it can actually be quite good for the body if properly portioned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>For example, you could eat some Red Cacao if you need a quick pick-me-up...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Green Cacao can lift your spirits if you're feeling down, and if you mix it with some Blue, it could even be a fairly potent painkiller! In addition to that—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, now! Have you thought about this before, or did you really come up with all of these potential uses for cacao in the short time since our job here began?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I came up with them while treating the girl, yeah! I just wanted to figure out how I could make her feel better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I was able to devise an antidote to neutralize the cacao's poison, too, which is why I'm so keen on experimenting with it further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>An antidote? You mean, there's a way to make it so the Rainbow Cacao won't be dangerous to eat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That's amazing! Without that danger, we might actually be able to open it back up to the market, and get those regulations rescinded. This could be huge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I suppose that's true. I wasn't even thinking about all that, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You weren't?! But your antidote could be a game-changer for everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You are a genuinely amazing person. How are you able to do so much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hehehe! I just have fun with my work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You certainly do get into it. But how fun can it really be to make medicines and treat people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>And how can you have so much fun when you're dealing with a patient who's...suffering?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oh, that's easy. It's fun to see them recover because of my medicine, of course! The fun is in knowing that I'm responsible for making then feel good again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's why I love analyzing different types of illnesses as much as I do. Devising possible cures for them is one of the greatest feelings in the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>And putting them to use is better still! Then whenever I see someone start perking up, I try to imagine what else I can do for them. It's...exhilarating, frankly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>No wonder you always look so happy when you're treating people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Exactly. I had lots of fun when I was tending to you, too, Margaret. It was my medicine that was able to bring you right back from death's door, after all. Can you even imagine how gratifying that was?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Lizzy...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(I can't believe what an idiot I've been! She wasn't deriving pleasure from seeing others in pain at all!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(Of course she isn't that kind of person. I knew Lizzy was the best! I love her so much. I'm going to stay by her side for the rest of my life! No more doubts—ever!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Lizzy, I'm going to do my very best so you can do all the experiments with Rainbow Cacao your heart desires someday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Are you? Well, that's great! I look forward to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yay! But first things first... Let's get going, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Goodness... One minute she's quiet as a mouse, and the next, she's sprinting off into the snow. She never changes, does she? What a handful my little sister is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I thought I told her to stop worrying me so much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hehe. I'm just glad she's back to her normal, cheerful self.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Come one, come all! If you seek to strengthen your magical powers, why not try some chocolate made with Purple and Red Cacao? Guaranteed to make you soar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Purple Cacao? But isn't that dangerous to eat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Oh, it'll hurt after you eat it, to be sure! But that just proves how potent it is. And if you want to become a powerful witch—and I know you do—well, it's like they always say: no pain, no gain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ugh! I'd say we found the right place, and the right guy, lying about the cacao without even a hint of concern or sympathy! He is the lowest of the low.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>But look at all the Rainbow Cacao he has! I could do so many experiments if I had even half that much to work with...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You sure could!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I can't believe how easy it was to find this place, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>(It's almost as if we were being led here...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hmm? Look, over there. That figure is behaving rather suspiciously, wouldn't you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Is she taking more cacao on the road to sell elsewhere? Something seems particularly off about her, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Halt! Who goes there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Are you guards? Why have you come?! We were told the regulations didn't apply here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Well, that's not a suspicious statement at all, is it? I sure would like to ask you a few questions...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Something tells me answers won't be very forthcoming, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Blasted do-gooders leaving us no choice... Dispose of them both!</td>
</tr>
