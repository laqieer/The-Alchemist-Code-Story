<td>This road leads to the city, aye! Soon we won't be able to see the locomotive!</td>

<td>How much longer until the overpass crosses the railway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>2 km until we reach the Panema Overpass, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>2 km, huh? Does the railway continue on straight from here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Squeak! The railway is laid out to avoid the hills, aye. There's one big curve further down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If we can cut across that hill, won't it save a little time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yep. Alkemono, calculate the route. It doesn't matter if there's no road. Find the shortest path to the overpass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
