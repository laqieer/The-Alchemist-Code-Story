<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Ve-very impressive, Captain Zahar! This is your best strategy yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Of course. I've set it up that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(Just as I thought, the enemy is headed toward the rear. No one in this battle can break through my defenses...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(Except that man!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Captain Zahar! The squadron protecting the enemy's mainline is headed straight this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Heh. Just as I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huzzaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Aim directly for the leaders! If we take them down, then it will change the direction of the battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(Exactly. In order to pave a path ahead, you have no choice but to defeat me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(I created this strategy exactly for this purpose!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I've been waiting for you! You, the man who ruined my strategy for the first time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So it was you then...! This time, let's end this battle properly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My name is Vettel! I am a proud and honorable knight of Envylia's Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I am Zahar! The Silver-Mane, the one who rules a corner Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So you are Zahar, who they call the Young Rider of Wratharis?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh? My name is familiar to you then. Very well, you shall give you last breath here, with that name engraved in your chest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hyaahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Arghhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What a terrifying battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The power of those two are so overwhelming, that it's impossible to get close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huff...huff... I've never encountered an enemy so strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But I'm still alive... If I'm alive, that means I can take him down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(Why does that man not go down?! I have not gone easy on him!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Do you dare to push me this far you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's far from over!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(No! I can't avoid his blow! I've no choice but to block it!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Heh...heheheh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Not bad, not bad at all! If you were to be the first to ruin my strategy, then it's understandable that you'd be the first to protect yourself from my sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(You're almost like a rare artifact I wish to collect. Show me your beautiful form!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Aghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Wh-what strength! My sword has become even heavier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>This is not the half of my strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ack...right back at you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(My sword is sharper than usual. Yet, he shows no sign of collapse.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(What is this oddly unpleasant feeling!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huff...huff... Zahar, I am grateful that I met you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Grateful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I would now have been able to experience your limitless strength and the joy of exchange blows, if I had not met you here as enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I see... I understand now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Vettel, withdraw your sword! The victory is mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What...?1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Look behind you. My soldiers have arrived at your front line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I have no interest in small fry fish. The life of the general you protect has reached its final moments...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Because I was holding you back here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>This fate of this battle has already been decided. Take your soldiers and leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What?! Do you dare show me compassion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Compassion? I have no need of such emotions. This is just part of my plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm going to push you to the limit of hopeless until I can hear the sound of despair ringing from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Let's fall back. Retreat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Captain Vettel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>There's no point in fighting any further. We will simply end up surrounded and destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'll accept the full blame of our retreat. You all bear no responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That's right. This is how it should be. This small stage is not where our final battle will be held.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'll accept your challenge. Good bye, Zahar. However, next time we meetâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That's my line. Away with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Heheh. Who would've thought that I'd find such a worthy opponent in battle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>(This is another first. This man truly does keep me on the edge!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The next time we meet, I will be the one to destroy you, Vettel!</td>
