<td>It's done. He's dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We didn't get any information out of him, though. Stubborn old thing.</td>

<td>It's only a matter of time.</td>

<td>What about the blue-haired girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The search is already underway, but her magic is going haywire. She's beyond our control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Well, it doesn't matter. She'll run herself into an early grave, and then she's not our problem anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That old fool was pathetic. He barely presented a challenge. I guess his magic must've dried up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Heh. Here in the country where women are above men, no one's gonna pay any attention to the disappearance of one old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Especially not an old Court Mage who wasn't long for this world to begin with.</td>

<td>You can't think properly when you're overheating.</td>

<td>I know! Why don't we go have some pancakes together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Do you like that idea? You'll have to calm down first, though.</td>

<tr>

<td>Lofia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Haa...haa...haa... Arghh! It's so c-cold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>She never seemed to feel the cold! I-I've never seen her shake so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>She must've used her magic to compensate for her lack of stamina, forcing her body to move beyond its natural limits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Arghhh...Nnrrrggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>This is all my fault.</td>

<td>Nyx...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>She's like this because of the time leap. If that hadn't happened, Lofia would've been fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The alchemic link between me and Mira is what dragged the both of you into Chance Encounter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>No! Lofia! No! Please, no! Don't leave me!</td>

<tr>
<td>056</td>

</tr>
<tr>
