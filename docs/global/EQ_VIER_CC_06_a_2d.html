<td>Try as I might to block it out...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...the cacophony of the feeding insects vibrates endlessly in my head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I cover my ears and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I have naught to sell to a dark elf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>So you're halfway through your transformation into dark elf, hm? Well? Which of our brethren did you kill? How dare you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Filthy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>However much time passes, wherever I go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>How do you just go on living like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Where are your manners? Who is your master?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Black ears like antennae, accumulating unwarranted contempt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No matter what I do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oi. How much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You've got guts, speakin' up. Sorry, there's not enough money in the world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Geh? Gahahahahaha! You tryin' to make me laugh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Beset by cruelty on all sides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There's nowhere safe to sleep, no time to dream, and my will ground away to nothing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>My life is already out of my hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hey, listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Welcome...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You call this fortune-telling? More like fortune-lying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Nothing you predicted happened. It was so wrong I should have just expected the opposite of everything you said to have happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's the nature of fortune.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So it's on the dot if you get it right, and on the dot if you don't?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's how it works.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Just tell me the truth. I don't appreciate such pitiful scamming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Even if it's not what you want to hear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huh. You're selling dreams, are you? I thought you were selling insight into the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No one can know the future. No one can know the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>There is more happiness to be found in being lied to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's not the kind of crap I thought I'd ever hear from a fortuneteller.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Then shall I give you a fortune guaranteed to come true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Payment upfront, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No, but I promise I'll make it worth your while if it's good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Fine then. Let us begin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hoo... The anticipation's got me on my toes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Here is your guaranteed fortune: "Sometime in the future, you will die."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's your play?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's a human failing to believe you can live on forever, which is why you hold onto dreams of the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yet all that truly awaits in your future...is death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Don't you have any dreams?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Only of death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh, good for you. At least you're consistent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Speaking of the death that waits in the future is pointless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's why I prefer to tell of events that will make you happy in this life. All you need to achieve happiness is to believe me when I say it will happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The thing is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I want to know about my death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>A philosopher, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The incredible thing about predictions is that they stick in your head, no matter how it pans out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I suppose that is the way of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Tell me how I'll die, oracle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's guaranteed to come true, right? The prediction of my impending death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Are you certain you want to know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Only if it is the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I don't know what...y-you all were counting on...but there is no limit to my power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You could defeat me right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You have the power to do so, yet you lack the conviction to see your ambitions through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>There is only one reason for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You still cling to your bonds to others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You've never thrown yourself into absolute solitude by cutting all ties you have with those you love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>If...your soul is lost...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I-I won't be able to...f-follow. P-please, Sol...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Please... D-don't...leave me. I don't want...to be...alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Did you see it? My death?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You're...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>In time, the sun will set and the stars that surround it will fall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>It's no good... It's the same as before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Well, did I actually die?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Did I die properly, along with the others?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I'm sorry. It's fragmented. I can't see it clearly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Well, that's hardly worth anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>It's fine. You don't owe me anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Hmph. How about this? A fortune for a fortune. Interested?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You're going to read the fortune of a fortuneteller?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Payment upfront, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You're going to charge me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It's only fair, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>With this, we'll really be even.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Umm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>It'll be a reset. I'm offering you a clean slate with me if you let me tell your future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Ok...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I've got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Well? What awaits me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Why don't you come with me and mine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What a rip off. That's neither fortune-telling, nor a prediction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Just an idea, really. One that will shed light on your past and let you make the most of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>My...past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>No human doesn't know that death is coming for them... That is why we try to leave behind legacies and children, write wills, and strive to leave our mark on history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>And me? I care way too much about "those who have gone before" if you get my drift.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I've read about the war of the high elves in history books and fiction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>The literature talks of a high elven hero who slew more dark elves than any other; one renowned for their magic, known by the name of Ephylinde.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Apparently their favorite phrase was "killing those who are evil is not an act of evil"...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>That...isn't who I am anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Why, because you're a dark elf now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>You know what sin creates a dark elf, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I don't give a damn who you are, high elf or dark elf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>So you'll take just anyone you think is powerful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You're starting to get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>You're very forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Well, there aren't that many people out there with real power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>The Veda Templars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Join us and your dream will come true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>You mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>You'll be able to die, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I am the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>You... You were once the light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Offer your service, and you will receive...a revelation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Even if I have been corrupted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>You have no dreams, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Mystic Tower Veda Fringe Dimension</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>That was what she said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>There's nothing to be excited about. I can't see any blooming seeds in her. No hope for the future, nothing to believe in...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Stop judging people by their ability to excite you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>She's like a shed skin, no substance. No fleeting desires, no base passions... A snow white soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>It's not a bad thing not to have high hopes. You pay more attention to your immediate surroundings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>It's just...insufferably dull.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>More importantly, does a person like this even have anything to trade for the power of another dimension?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>It's distasteful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>That rich, coming from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>You're not wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Are you really? No matter, you're here now. The fourth of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>We're about to see the dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>This...sweet fragrance...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>We can't move?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>It's an illusion... So powerful. It's so persistent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>At last, someone with power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Someone who can put me to sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>You're saying we're being manipulated by an illusion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Do I have to walk you through it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Bang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Sol's magic bullet?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Well, that was pathetic. You'll never hit the vital points at that rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Should I make it easier for you? Aim here, for my eardrum. It'll give you a straight shot to my brain. Take me out in one hit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>You're wrong if you think it'll be that easy to get me to do what you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Well, it was worth a shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Here, boy. Come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Killjoy. This isn't fair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Sometimes a hardy body is just an inconvenience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Are you nuts?! Now that you have the power of another dimension, you want to use us to kill you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Anyone will do. Anyone who will put me to sleep. Man or woman... It doesn't matter to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Any man who raises his hand against a woman is worse than a dog! That's my philosophy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>There's no gender in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Haa... Haa... Well done... Keep it up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Well, you're certainly more troublesome and interesting than I'd expected. You've got a lot of nerve making us do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Deceived again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I'm tired of all this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Hoping and trying not to hope every time I meet someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>If you're seeking death, you didn't need to wait for anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>I have nothing against you two. Your timing just happened to be convenient for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>I'm the one who invited you to join us, so I'm responsible for you! This isn't where you die! You know that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Stop saying such pathetic things!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>I'm not here to put on a show. I want to die as a high elven hero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>I am the corruption that must be extinguished. I am a dark elf, guilty of killing my own. I fooled the sun of Lost Blue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>This nightmare... I just...</td>
