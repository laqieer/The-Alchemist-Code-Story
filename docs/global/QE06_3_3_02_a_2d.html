<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>How did you get here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You mean, because you sent your Dismortants after me so that I wouldn't make it? I'd think the answer should be quite apparent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I cut everything to ribbons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It took more time than expected to exterminate them all, but Lady Celis was counting on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Therefore, I knew I had to make it here, come whatever may.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's the long and short of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Cut everything to ribbons? Umm, how many were there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I stopped counting after ten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Is she for real?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm going to say, maybe?<br>Anyway, Jubei, you say you were entrusted with a mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'll keep this brief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That is the general report I was entrusted to deliver.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That was the Blade Fox's purpose...from the start?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Celis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Tell me, then. What has become of Lady Celis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>My being here is all the answer you need, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You fiend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So, you cornered her and ran her down. But I would surmise you did not stay to witness her last moments, and thus her fate remains at least somewhat uncertain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This is a matter of pure conjecture on my part, but from my observations, Judius is a man who only trusts verified results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>As such, his answer to my question speaks more than the words themselves would suggest, since he did not confirm but merely imply Lady Celis' demise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh! So, you're saying that if the results aren't certain, he'll kind of dodge the question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That is my theory, yes. So, tell me, Judius... Am I correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hmph. She hasn't made it back here, and that's enough of a result for me. For all intents and purposes, it's the same as being dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Best not to undersell the strength of one's determination, lest you be caught flat-footed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Nonsense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>There was a time I shared your outlook, you know. But a certain someone relieved me of that misconception.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I wasn't sure how to improve my bladework, and that person told me this: swinging a sword is not merely a matter of technique or practice, but for whom you wield it—for whom you fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If you've found a person to fight for, then even should their heart turn to that of a demon, you will retain the resolve to defend them to the bitter end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Even if others malign you, you will become as strong as you must for the sake of that person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I learned all of this from the very person I fight for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>And she is the one who entrusted me to come here. So for that purpose—for Lady Celis—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I will crush all of your research to dust. And if my power is not enough, then I will draw power from all those who've been cut down before me, no matter how I may be perceived for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm not sure I understand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>My squad was captured by demons. I was on my way to save them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I wanted to let them die not as demons, but as people, even if it meant censure for breaking the corps' rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That's horrible! So your expulsion—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Rules are rules, and I broke them. Who would believe that they had turned to demons without even being bitten?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That was his doing too, then, wasn't it? How could you, Judius?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I was merely testing practical field applications. I will accept accolades for the results, but there is no call for reproach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Amane. Azami. Go outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I'll catch up as soon as I've finished with these demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Do as you wish. I'll simply take this opportunity to study your techniques.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Like everything else, I'm certain they'll be mere child's play next to the sheer power and tenacity of the Dismortants!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Off with you! Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Let's go, Azami.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Can you clear a safe passage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You intend to fight me and the Dismortants by yourself? That's suicide, you realize. Have you given up, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You know nothing of the Blade Fox.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Did you think we hadn't considered the possibility of our headquarters being occupied by demons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Ridiculous! You intend to bring down the entire building?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If we don't destroy all of the Dismortants, then our actions are truly meaningless. I intend to make certain we finish what we started, and leave no stone unbroken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It won't be as easy as all that, I'm afraid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'll do whatever it takes to finish off every last one of these creatures. And that goes double for you, Judius!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The demon called malice is running rampant over Wadatsumi, and I see its root inside you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>As the successor to the Black Star, I will excise that demon with my bare hands if I must!</td>
</tr>
