<td>This must be the deserted house that we were told about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yeah. This must be where we'll find that gang with the strange marks on their bodies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ack! What is that putrid smell?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That...is the stench of rotten flesh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Look at that wall, Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Was this diagram...drawn in blood? And these alchemic tools on the floor, I've seen them before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It appears that this place was some sort of laboratory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>There are traces of many people frequenting this place. It couldn't be more than a day since this one died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But all of this is so... This is nothing like the Alchemy that I know of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>How can such an inhumane deed as this be called Alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This must not continue. We cannot let this continue! Who would do such a—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Waaaaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That voice! It came from the other room!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Tch! We were too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Who are you? Why do you stand in my way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Why did you kill that child?! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This worthless thing? I could barely extract any Alchemia from it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I simply rid myself of worthless livestock. That is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Haaa...haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What...is this? Who is this man?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>A Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You came in search of the Sephira. Am I wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>This can't be! The Sephira are a people that value wisdom and compassion! They would never have a hand in such deplorable acts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>How can you be so sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's been a long time since they were considered to be the disciples of mercy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Even that was nothing more than legend and hearsay. Would it really be so surprising if this was their true nature?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's time to make a decision, Logi Crowley.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>There is evil before you. An unforgivable crime is being committed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But at the same time, these could be the people you were looking for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What will you do? Turn a blind eye to their deeds for the sake of your mission, or—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I will stop them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>This is wrong. What they are doing cannot possibly save anybody.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Are you sure of your choice? Even if it means sealing the fate of your mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hmph. Naive, but not bad. I'm glad that you were the first to find us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Isidore...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'm sorry. That name I gave you was an alias. I am not Isidore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>My name is Kamui. I'm the head of the courier guild known as the Fruit Peddlers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I am the one who bears the truth of the Sephira in order to impart it to the next generation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Kamui! Are you really one of the Sephira?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I am, and so too was the man you just cut down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>In this past one hundred years, without a place to call home, our people have split into two factions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We, the Fruit Peddlers, chose to adapt to the new era, to the new land, with hopes for the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The others, the Collectors of Wisdom, are lost souls unwilling to accept the loss of Sephiron, and have instead chosen to do whatever it takes to revive the great tree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>So then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes. Their purpose is the revival of Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>They will not shy away from any evil to accomplish that goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>And this... This is the result, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I did not expect them to have fallen so low.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Never could I have anticipated that they would be desperate enough to have a hand in blood-drenched, alchemical taboos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>As if you could understand! You were fortunate enough to have been blessed with Sephiron's final grace, Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>From the shadows?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>This level of subterfuge—these are the skills of Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>We have spent the past hundred years gathering wisdom from every corner of this continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Slothstein's magic, Lustberg's witchcraft, Wadatsumi's chakra, Saga's Ouija, and now...Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>All for the sake of Sephiron's rebirth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>We exist solely for this purpose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Here they come, Logi! They're stronger than they look. Do not hesitate to use whatever force necessary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
