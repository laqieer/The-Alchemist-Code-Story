<td>Are you...Tina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>How do you know my name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Kiki and Adel told me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You can speak to them?! Who are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You said you were sent on behalf of Tehre. What do you want with us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well, I come to you today to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Come on then. Quickly, speak up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ahh. I can't talk like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I end up stumbling over my words! No more! Enough of that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sorry, Voda, Fuu. I'll stop with the formal talk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm not quite sure what's going on. What is your purpose here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Tehre told me to ask you where Beelzebub is. He says, "Either Voda or Fuu should know."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>And what if we refuse to tell you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He says, "Would you rather have your village destroyed or tell me where the Sacred Stone is?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That brat...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It appears he's aware of our location as well. There's no doubt that he's working together with the Gluttony army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I don't want to do either, but...I can't allow these ones to lose their home...the Forest of Rukifojio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...Gurrrr.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Why are you with Kiki and Adel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ever since I was little, I could understand what animals were saying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>They're all my important friends. Tehre just doesn't get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>He tells me not to hang out with Voda's guardian beasts. "You belong to the Tehre faction," he tells me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That doesn't matter. We're all part of Saga. You're right to think the way you do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But if I don't listen to Tehre, these animals are gonna lose their home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's why...sorry! Can you please tell me where the Sacred Stone is?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That thing is dangerous. It's not something we can easily give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I don't know which of us are at an advantage in this situation, but I'd really prefer not to be part of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But it's for the sake of my friends! Once I give the signal, the Gluttony soldiers are gonna come charging down at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If you're not telling me, I'm gonna give the signal right away and they'll destroy this village! Come on! Hurry up and decide!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oww...! Huh...? Is that wand...floating?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>A child like you shouldn't have to do something he doesn't want to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Let's calm down and talk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If we talk it over, I'm certain that we can work something out! We'll find a way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...!</td>
