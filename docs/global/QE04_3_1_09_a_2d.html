<td>001</td>
<td>You come entreating me now, yet why did you not save Alia then...even if it meant breaking the law?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The law is meant to exist for the sake of Saga. Yet defending it has led to this result. How pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What about you? You say you want to protect Saga, yet you've joined forces with the Gluttony army. Don't you think that's pathetic?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Please, explain it to us so that we can be convinced you did it for the sake of Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I entreat you as well. I am well aware that we are still inadequate! However, our desire to protect Saga is pure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is a waste of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's not a waste of time! I have received the power of foresight from Asena and have seen the future of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I have seen the conflict...and the giant dragon's flames that will burn it all down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And, in another vision, I've foreseen Asena's death...at the hands of Georgios!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I am here to change that future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Tehre, please, speak to us in a way that will make us understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You do not see that this current situation is a result of your over-reliance on Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Over-reliance...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes. All of you have placed too much reliance on Asena...on nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's the same thing Georgios said...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So...is that the reason you began trading with other countries...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Of course. If we remained closed off from the rest of the world, our advancements would fall behind. Ultimately, we would lose the ability to protect this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Saga's fragility comes from the fact that all of you continue to rely on nature. In order to protect one's country, its people must become stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is that really what strength is?! Is relying on guns and weapons and neglecting nature the true definition of strength?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Artillery like this is commonplace in other countries. In order to withstand invasion, we must consider such weapons as an option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You are the one who is tolerating Gluttony's invasion of our country! What you are saying makes no sense to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Tina! Calm down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Tehre, does that mean you were aware that the Gluttony army was responsible for the outbreak of the Jam?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Of course, I was aware of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Do you know how many lives were lost because of that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>How dare you claim to be protecting Saga while sacrificing its people?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If it weren't for the Jam...countless lives could've been saved! ...Mocca, too, wouldn't be suffering under its corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You say you fight for Saga, yet all you're doing is acting as an accomplice in its invasion! I cannot...forgive that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hyaaaaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hmph. Your inadequate Ouija will not reach me. If you wish to know the truth, then prove that your resolve and power is enough to defeat me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This is not the full extent of my power! Hyaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I see. Alchemy, huh? Who...are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I am one who has vowed to protect Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>My power may be inadequate, but I will make you acknowledge my resolve! And I will have you explain all of your actions!</td>
</tr>
