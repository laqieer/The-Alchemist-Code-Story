<td>No matter how many I take down, they just keep coming back!</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>I told you, all I needed was for you to buy me some time. You cannot defeat them. They are beyond this world, ghosts without real substance or will.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Come, Kamui. Look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This is your home. This is the miracle that you have brought forth as the last Protector of the Sephira!</td>

<td>005</td>
<td>Lord Waginau?! Y-you're...?!</td>

<td>006</td>
<td>Nngh... It seems like perhaps I overdid it. I suppose it was only to be expected, having used the Burning Seal to seal Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>However, it was not all for naught. The Door within Sephiron has been closed, and shades have been drawn against the maleficent light shining down upon these lands.</td>

<td>008</td>
<td>Kamui, you who are my last disciple...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes, Lord Waginau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This is goodbye. Ha. Now that I think of it, you are the only disciple I have ever had.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Now this world has lost Sephiron, the Tree of Life. Such a waste... Another light lost from this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heed my words, Kamui. This will be a troubled time for the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The world will treat the Sephira with suspicion. Fear and distrust will come to eclipse justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Remember that Emmel's deepest wish was, and always will be, this: "Even so, live on!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Y-yes! I won't forget!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Good. Then, you who remind me of who I once was... Farewell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Lord Waginau! No...but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There will be time to grieve later. First, I must rejoin the Liberation Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I must go see what the situation is outside.</td>
