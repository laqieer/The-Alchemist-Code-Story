<td>You know, I do get where you're both coming from—I really do!—but even if you learn something from this inadvisable jaunt, wouldn't opening up sales for Rainbow Cacao to the public be...extremely difficult?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I mean, people are getting seriously ill just from eating chocolate made with the stuff. It's going to take a lot more than positive thinking to get the laws overturned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hmm. You do have a point. But as I was saying before, I really don't think Rainbow Cacao is all that bad overall. There's so much more to be gained from it than the court would have you believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Such as?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well, each of the cacaos has a disparate effect. Red enhances passion, blue calms, yellow makes one more honest, green grants courage, orange makes one friendlier, purple has a charming effect, and brown is...just tasty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>None of those things is inherently bad; it's just that their effects are really powerful, so if they're not used properly or carefully, they can be hazardous. But that's true of many things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Granted, Purple Cacao's ability to attract monsters doesn't do much to further my case...and, technically it is rather poisonous...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But still! Purple does not represent the lot, and I believe the other cacaos are very much safe for general consumption if properly prepared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Come to think of it, I guess Noah and Emma did say that eating some Green Cacao gave them the courage to make up with each other after their big fight...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So I guess you're right. There are potential benefits to be had.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>There you have it! And from the sounds of it, there are lots of people who are practically frothing at the mouth to get their hands on some.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Even literally frothing at the mouth, perhaps, having acquired their cacao from the black market with no idea how to use it. Which is why I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Aah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Excuse you? Are you not even going to apologize for running into Lizzy? That's bad manners, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wait, Margaret. Something's not right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Are... Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I-I'm...fine. Leave me...alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You are most certainly not! You're pale as a sheet, drenched in cold sweat, and your breathing's all over the place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We can't just leave her like this. It's probably best if we take her to a doctor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No...please. I don't want...to go to...a hospital. I'm fine...so just... Uuuoogh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I don't think you're in any position to decline medical attention, little lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No worries. I can look her over right here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hmm... You're showing symptoms of poisoning. What have you eaten recently? I can smell something sweet on you. Do you still have it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Sweet? Oh, you're right! It smells like chocolate, in fact. Which I'm guessing means...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Just as I thought! This is chocolate made from Rainbow Cacao, without a doubt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Aha. Well, that would certainly do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Poisoned by chocolate! To think so many would fall victim to such a thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Rainbow Cacao is a mystifying substance indeed, to cause such severe reactions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Little girl, I'd like to check the inside of your mouth, now. Open up and say "ahh," please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hmm, okay. Well, the good news is, you're going to be just fine! I happen to have some medicine on hand that should fix you right up. Let's see... Ah, here it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You're going to feel a little pin-prick, but do bear with it! It'll be over before you know it. Hehehe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh. So she actually can treat people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Of course! Lizzy's incredible. Like I said before, she's the one who cured my illness. I wouldn't be here today were it not for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hey! It's going to be all right. I will find the cure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>She was like a goddess to me then, coming down from on high to save me... And she still is, even now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>A goddess, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, excellent! That one worked nice and fast. Next, I've got some medicine for you to drink. It's a little bitter, but it should finish the job. Open your mouth once more, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Any change? That should've taken effect right away as well. No? How very odd. I was sure it would! Let's try this one next, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I don't know about you, but it looks to me like she's just having fun experimenting on that poor girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Of course she's not! Pr-probably...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>No, wait, I can stand by that! She's not. I think she's just gotten a tiny bit excited because she's never encountered these sorts of symptoms before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Lizzy's the type of person who takes any and every illness seriously and tries her very best to cure them all. There's no way she'd ever derive pleasure from someone else's suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>All right, here comes the next one! This one goes up your nose, so try not to sneeze it out, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Uoorgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Just a tiny bit excited, you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Well, thank goodness her symptoms have subsided, if nothing else. We should ask her how she came to be in possession of that chocolate once she wakes up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I can't believe the effects of Rainbow Cacao are so severe. If she hadn't literally run into us, things could've gone very badly for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yeah. She could easily have lost her life. We'll have to find ways to counteract those effects before we even consider trying to put it out on the market.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hey. I analyzed the chocolate the girl had with her. I can hardly believe how fascinating Rainbow Cacao actually is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Consider my interest in it well and truly piqued now. I feel like I could definitely make good medicine with it, and I'd love to run some experiments if the possibility should present itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>How can you even think of medicine-making and experimenting after someone was just suffering so much right before your eyes?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hmm? What do you mean? She's stable now, so there's no further need for concern, is there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I-I wouldn't go that far...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>She hasn't woken up yet, so I think it's a little too soon to...say things like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What? Did I say something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Aaah! Someone, help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Quickly, everyone! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What?! Why are there monsters here? And they're headed our way, no less!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Oh, could it be because of the chocolate? When I analyzed it, I found high amounts of Purple Cacao.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'd say that's a safe bet, then! There's even more of them now. They just keep coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Gwwwaaaaarrrrrggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
