<td>Hmm. You do have a point. But as I was saying before, I really don't think Rainbow Cacao is all that bad overall. There's so much more to be gained from it than the court would have you believe.</td>

<td>Well, each of the cacaos has a disparate effect. Red enhances passion, blue calms, yellow makes one more honest, green grants courage, orange makes one friendlier, purple has a charming effect, and brown is...just tasty!</td>

<td>None of those things is inherently bad; it's just that their effects are really powerful, so if they're not used properly or carefully, they can be hazardous. But that's true of many things.</td>
