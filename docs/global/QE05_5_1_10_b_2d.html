<td>Um... Dias?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm so glad you're alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Erm, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You seem to be doing well. Are you eating well? How are you getting along with Logi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I think we're doing fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Did...I say something weird?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So you really did lose your memory, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry... Am I that different from before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You have nothing to be sorry about. I think you're fine as you are. There's no need to hold onto bad memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hahaha. Logi and I have lots of memories with you that we'd rather forget, to be honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>W-was I really that harsh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sorry to interrupt your precious moment, but we do have to discuss something important with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I know. You want me to mobilize the 4th Regiment to aid the Liberation Army, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If possible, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>To put it simply, I cannot fight alongside the Liberation Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Why not? Ceclidis will wreak havoc upon this continent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Will the Holy Guard do nothing in the face of his savagery?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We've been ordered to stand down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Could you not help us for old times' sake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I assume it was Kamui's idea to have you come ask me, but as the Captain of the 4th Regiment, I cannot mobilize the Holy Guard's paladins on a personal account.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Our Lord Commander considers this matter an internal affair within Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We exist to maintain order on behalf of the Continent. We do not get involved with each country's welfare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But, still...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't make me repeat myself. I cannotâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Captain Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The Jam are approaching our barracks! They are clearly targeting our forces!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Take up arms to counter! The Jam will riddle their opponents with curses, so keep your distance and fight with alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What is going on? Our barracks are concealed with alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The Jam lack the necessary Alchemia detection to find them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ah, um... Sorry about this, Dias.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm being used as a distraction to keep Ceclidis' eyes off of our soldiers' movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The curse upon me seems to attract the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Kamui told us that if we were to approach you, Ceclidis would suspect cooperation between us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>He believed Ceclidis would send most of his forces this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We had to take some desperate measures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Kamui has a message for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>"An enemy's enemy is an ally, right?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Sorry to force your hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That weasel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Well, you know... Do your best. I mean, we'll help if you need us to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>That won't be necessary! Keep yourselves hidden in the camp, out of our way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Everybody! Form ranks! Get ready for a fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Protector Kamui! You will pay for this!</td>
</tr>
