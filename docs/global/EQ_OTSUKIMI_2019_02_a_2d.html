<td>002</td>
<td>Take this!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I didn't know Tamamo was so strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And Hazel... That firepower, decisive action... Amazing as ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(But...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Phew! The wolves are gone and we got the silver grass we needed! Yay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I feel a little bad. It was us who barged into their territory. They were just defending themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You're right! If you can hear us, we're sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Do I have to tell you to not go running off on your own? It can be dangerous out here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hazel...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There's something nostalgic about this place. Reminds me of back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hazel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>When is "back then"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We worked as partners when we were mercenaries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hazel offered to team up with me when I was still a novice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I was surprised. At the time, Hazel had already established a name for herself as an expert mercenary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Evelika is well-versed in magical engineering. Plus, she can handle her weapon really well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>She's also very agile and perceptive. More so than I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>She always notices when I add some toppings to my cheese dogs. Always nagging me like, "You're over-doing it," and "You need to eat more vegetables!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, you usually keep your cheese dogs plain. It's easy to notice when you add things to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>When you've started adding toppings, that means you've been eating cheese dogs frequently enough to get bored with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Now that's what I call perceptive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>She's such a mom. People always mention how they can't tell who's older between us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Evelika, you're so thoughtful and caring. I knew I could trust you to cover my back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hazel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Evelika...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Out of the way, out of the way! I'm ridin' here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Caris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh, hey! Evelika! Long time no see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I brought you guys something! Special moon-gazing dumplings from Carol!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Thanks Caris! But, uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wh-what's with that horde of monsters?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh, cool! They're stampeding this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Not sure why, but they just won't get off my tail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Heh, got me worked up though. Made me go super fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I think you're always going a little too fast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Why are you all so calm?! Why are those monsters so frenzied?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hmm... I don't know why, but they keep trying to get at these dumplings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>They're after the dumplings? Let me see them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>There's a letter from Carol. Let's see... "When I started making the dumplings, I realized I was out of flour."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>So I went shopping for some and this rainbow-colored flour was on sale! Aren't these dumplings so pretty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Rainbow-colored...? Reminds me of the Rainbow Cacao. I think red stood for passion, blue for peace, purple was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh, no! If you find a purple dumpling, keep it hidden! It'll excite the monsters and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Look at this! This one's purple! Looks weird, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well, would you look at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I wonder what flavor it's supposed to be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Aw, come on! What did I just say?!</td>
