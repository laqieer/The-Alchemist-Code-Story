<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Phew… That's all the deliveries for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Rachel!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Did you finish your shift? You did, didn't you? C'mon, let's hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>H-Hey! Moa! Don't pull so hard! Why'd you come all the way here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>To take you to that creperie I've been dying to try out! I've heard it's the latest date spot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Eve told me that if a couple shares one of the shop's crepes they'll be granted everlasting love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Isn't that wonderful? Everlasting love! You think it's wonderful too, don't you? Of course, you do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Er…yeah…sure. You really love talking about "love" don't you, Moa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Duh! Love brings people joy! ...Hm? Is that…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Eve and Fraise! This must mean…they're on a date! Right? RIGHT? Eeeee!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Shh! Settle down! Aha…so this must be the amazing Eve you've been telling me about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Uh-huh! And the guy next to her is her boyfriend, Fraise. Don't they look so cute together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>They're both strong and kind and they love each other very much. They're my ideal couple!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Their love defies all obstacles, even the curse on this country and their differing birthplaces. And the way they keep the flame alive by writing letters is just…TOO CUTE!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wow…that's pretty moving. So, they write letters, huh. Now that you mention it, I think I've delivered letters to Eve's house before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But not lately…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Eek! They're coming this way! This must mean…they're here to share those famed crepes! Quick, hide!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>W-Whoa! I told you not to pull so hard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Fraise, my sweet, over here! Hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Eve, darling, relax. Your legs may be used to walking in this icy country, but not mine…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't worry! I'll catch you before you fall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Er, that's not what I meant…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We have to make the most of our time together. Won't your work with the knights be getting busier soon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I want to make lots of memories now, so that I won't be lonely when we can't see each other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Eve…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Sooooo, let's start by sharing a crepe while we take a stroll and watch the sunset and grab something to eat…and um…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You there! What do you think you're doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You appear to be a knight from Envylia. We don't allow people from other countries to enter Lustburg…especially men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hey, cut that out! Why are you being so mean to him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Eve, I'm sure you understand. We've closed our borders and limited interaction with foreign countries for our own safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Outsiders will bring about ruin and unrest. The Lion Monarch's Charge proved this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Er, um…I realize Lustburg is taking that stance now, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Fraise would never do anything bad. And besides, Lustburg's circumstances have nothing to do with outsiders!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>If you're serious about being together, there's no way you can say it has nothing to do with him…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>…Come to think of it, haven't you been searching for a way to break Asmodeus's curse? Let me guess, no luck yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>…! Well, um--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Eve, darling…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>He may enter Lustburg only if you are married. So, go on--hurry up and tie the knot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>…Of course, the way things are now, if you decide to formalize your relationship then he'll end up an insect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>…What's her problem?! This is unacceptable!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yeesh! Moa, calm down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Let go! Let go of me!!! How dare she say that to Eve! Of all the rotten things to say!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Anybody who hurts Eve or gets in the way of her romance is gonna have to throw down with me!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That won't solve anything. It'll just make things worse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Eve...is everything alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>…Yeah! I'm fine. I'm used to getting into trouble…ever since I was in school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I feel like I should apologize for our plans being ruined… I was really looking forward to a fun date with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>…I'm always making you worry somehow or another, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Eve…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Poor Eve…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Sometimes what you think is important doesn't necessarily mesh with the real world, honey. It can be sad, even painful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>There's a lot you can't do. So, you do what you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…That's right. Mom used to smile that big smile of hers. Never causing anyone to worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>She kept loving the man she loved in her own special way despite all the naysayers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm proud of Mom. I look up to her…but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What's wrong, Moa? You look depressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Uh…do I? I thought I was doing a good job of hiding it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'm pretty observant when it comes to these things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Let me guess--it's about Eve?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>…Yeah. I feel like she wasn't her usual self yesterday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Eve's normally an amazing person! She's always upbeat and cheerful and kind and she always gives her all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>She does this thing she calls "Bridal Training" in order to find a way to break the curse on our country…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>So that witch's story was true… I can't believe someone would seriously consider doing something so bonkers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Eve is the type of person that would do anything for her love, Fraise. That's why she's my idol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I wouldn't be where I am today without Eve's bright smile and boundless energy…but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>…Something about the way she smiled yesterday was off--it was filled with melancholy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>…If it bothers you so much, why don't we go check on her after class?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Huh? Together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Yeah. I mean, you seem kind of nervous to go by yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Besides…I'm curious to talk with her myself. She's a strong female role model who doesn't let society push her around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Hiya! *Grunt* *Pant* Hiiiyaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Didn't you say she was feeling down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Umm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Oh! Moa! Did you bring along a friend today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Y-Yeah! I thought you--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>As you can see, I'm training! Now that I'm all warmed up, it's time to break a sweat wiping out some monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You gals care to join me? Nothing is quite as invigorating as physical activity!</td>
