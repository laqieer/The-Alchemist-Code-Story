<td>It's been several months since I left.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Don't get me wrong; I want to help Soren and the others. Help stop Goetia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But not until I find out what happened to Roxanne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Even...even a body would suffice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...No, I refused to believe that. I'll find her, one way or another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>And so time and again I found myself back in Slothstein and its winding alleys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Back to where I could find the truth for myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This must be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Several streets down, an imposing building stands squarely in the middle of a plaza.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hundreds of shelves overflowing with damning evidence squatted within its steely confines, a testament to Slothstein's crime-ridden underbelly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(Not surprised about the heavy patrols.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(Guess I'll have to find some other way in.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I crept from shadow to shadow for several hours in vain for an opening. There was never any.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Then, just when I was about to reconsider my approach...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(Where are all the guards?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(Seems like they were called away by something.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Guess this is my best shot at getting in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...There she was. But this time, she had a bullet with my name on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Black Rose. Remember it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We will meet again here, when it is right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Funny how things circle right back around to where it all started.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>On hindsight, this was a huge risk. Foolish, even.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But I took it. I had to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Did Goetia have her under their thumb? Was she on another of her infiltration attempts? Was the amnesia a front?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>At least one of it has to be true... Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(Hmm.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(No sign of her I can see...for now.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(Just the same patrols, although it seems a little light today.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Perhaps I was walking straight into a trap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Turn the corner and bam - right between the eyes, like she wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...Wouldn't that be a fitting end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I don't have anything to lose anymore, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What's one last dance to a man with a death wish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Coast looks clear...for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Best not to draw too much attention on the way.</td>
