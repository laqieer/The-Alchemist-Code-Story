<td>Greed Dike?!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes... The damage they've done is too great, and all we can do for now is defend ourselves until this blows over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>With this timing, it can't be a coincidence. If they're attacking here, too, then they must be trying to take Lucifer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I think I'm going to have to take Lucifer and hide it somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Take it...? But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I have to. Lucifer's power can be suppressed for a little while if I overwhelm it with a lot of Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is the only way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The worst that can happen is that I get absorbed by Lucifer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But if things stay as they are, Orion will get his hands on the stone, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Justice will be lost in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You're...right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Kanon, I'll do it. No. I have to do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This is my fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>For this world, and for you, Kanon...I will definitely succeed! Leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Dummy! Why are you trying to take it all on yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm going to help! Obviously!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's too dangerous to do it alone. If we do it together, then our chances of success will go way up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I know you're used to doing things alone, but there are some things you just can't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So let me help...as Lord Commander, yes, but more than that...as a friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There's no time. Let's get started!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Kanon, be careful not to get absorbed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You too, Lakina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaaaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huff...huff... Did that do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Kanon, don't let it get to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Gh! Aaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm all right! You've done this all alone until now, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Then let meâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ugaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Kanon...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Aaaaaagggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ngh... Lakina...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Kanon, you know how Alchemia have wavelengths, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The wavelengths of those from Northern Pride can affect Lucifer better than any other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That's why the Captain of the 7th Regiment is always someone from Northern Pride. Don't forget that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Because...I think you'll need to pick out the next captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Lakina, what are you saying? Why would I need to decide on a new captain?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Kanon, you saved me. You know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>And you can save so many other people, too, so I can't let you die here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I can't let the Lord Commander be lost. That's my duty, as the Captain of the 7th Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I want to save the person who cried for me. I want to save my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That is all that is important to me now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Lakina, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'll definitely suppress Lucifer, so Kanon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Save this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Lakina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Ngh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(Oh...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Lakina, don't go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(I'm so happy.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Lakina!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>(The last thing I saw was you, Kanon.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(That's why I'm happy.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I was able to temporarily seal Lucifer, and thus, was brought to this world alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>So that's what happened. I understand the whole story now, of how you came to be here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You've spent an absurd amount of time here alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'm used to being alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What could possibly be keeping you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>A very selfish reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I wanted to see Kanon again so badly, and I was scared that if I died completely, I could never see her again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>That's why I decided to wait here in this world for as long as I need to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I see. Well, what do you mean when you say you want to save Commander Kanon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I don't know when it started, but I began sensing her Alchemia here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That's not that strange, is it? I mean, you said yourself that this is the world between life and death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It's only natural to think that Commander Kanon must be dead. She was from a generation long before I was even born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yeah, I guess you're right...but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>It feels as though she is locked away somewhere in this world, still living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
