<td>Mmm. It's much better to be lazing around like this, instead of fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Besides, there's a lot of green and animals around this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh? Everyone seems to have suddenly gone somewhere. I wonder what the matter is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hey, everyone? Where are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well, never mind. Good night!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Scwhop! Caught you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This fluffy sensation is great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're a mixture of human, rabbit, and eagle, right? That's all the best things!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Your appearance and talent explains why you were sold to Lustburg as soon as you were born. Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ahh...mm...st-stop...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wow, amazing! I heard the rumors and came all this way to see you. It was worth it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Amongst my own, none of them have such fur like yours. Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Especially your tail! It's fluffy and moist qualities are exceptional!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Mm, excuse me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No, but really; these ears shouldn't be ignored either. This smooth and soft sensation is hard to find even in nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>E-excuse me! Wh-who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, don't worry. I'm Meldaâ€“a Beast Tamer that was just passing by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So you're the rumored Beast Tamer lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, there are people who call me that. Anyway, you are so, so fluffy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Umm, can you stop that? I can't sleep when you do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No. It's adorable, and it's not like you lose anything from me touching it. Don't be stingy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's easy for you to say...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You're tired, aren't you? You can sleep if you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If something happens while you sleep, I promise to protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Melda...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I won't let this fluffiness to anyone else's hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I really wish you'd leave me alone...</td>
