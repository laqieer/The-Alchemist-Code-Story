<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I crawled my way forward to where I stand now, my soul ever rooted in the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I once believed I loved to fight, and even after learning that such love was little more than a fleeting infatuation, I still couldn't bear to leave it behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I knew of no other way to end conflict, so I continued to swing my axe, through storm and calm alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And one of the aspects of that I enjoyed most, all this time, was sparring with you every now and again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It always made me feel almost as though I'd grown wings on my back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Urk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What's the matter, Lamia? Surely this isn't your limit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Not even close!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You will most definitely mourn after taking my life. But remember: though a flower may fall, its petals will continue to flutter and dance upon the wind...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...even if but for a brief moment in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You must fly on, Lamia. You won't tread on flowers anymore, so long as you remain in the air.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ride the winds of battle, and bring ruination where new growth is needed, for yet another thousand nights!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huzzaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You, and you alone, will never fall to ruin in my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>In the language of flowers, you are my happiness...my jasmine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Lamia. I want you to have this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This pendant! Isn't this your...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Will you listen...to one last request?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wratharis will surely face a great conflict in the near future. Countless innocent people will be affected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I want you to protect those who are unable to protect themselves. Fight on, as fiercely as is needed, to bring an end to the conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I will. I promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hatred does not suit you. Had I fallen by the hands of another, I suspect this poppy would have been stained with hate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>There can be no doubt of that. But I believe those other two would have carried on your mission, regardless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm so sorry...to have burdened you with so much... I just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's no burden. Truly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I will carry on your will. I will fight to the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So long as I know you rest in peace, I will fight on with no hatred and no regrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Heh. There really is nothing more I can teach you, is there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Soon after that day, just as Theresa said, Wratharis was enveloped in war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Experiments conducted by an underground organization rooted in Wratharis were suddenly exposed as a national endeavor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Gluttony Foss then denounced Wratharis, claiming the research to have been stolen from their labs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Other nations may have been involved as well, but they stayed silent—even the Holy Guard said nothing—so Gluttony Foss felt justified placing the blame squarely on Wratharis, and summarily invaded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Gluttony Foss demanded all documents and research relating to the experiment be handed over, but Wratharis denied the experiments even occurred, playing innocent to the bitter end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Having exhausted most of its resources in the already drawn-out war with Envylia, Wratharis was at a disadvantage during the initial stages of the conflict, which led most to believe it would end quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>However, a single knight wielding a spear valiantly fought on, unyielding even against the opposing military juggernaut.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>She displayed great determination and willingness to put her life on the line in the name of protecting those who couldn't protect themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Her inspiring conviction roused the other knights, bringing them back to their feet and giving them the inspiration to fight on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The war brought great devastation to both armies, and continued until the king of Gluttony Foss ordered a full retreat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>In the end, Wratharis succeeded in keeping Gluttony Foss' army from advancing much beyond the border.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This extended conflict later came to be known as the Thousand Nights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I finally had the opportunity to come see you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I did it. I inherited your will, and fought to the end with it...the end of one war, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh! Hello, Kalmia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'll be leaving this country soon, so I figured I'd come pay my respects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>For what? The flowers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ah, well... That too, but that's...not what I meant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Then what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I wanted to thank you for fighting with us back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's nothing to thank me for. I didn't do it for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We did what we felt was right in the name of ending conflict. Not as Envylian knights, but as fellow opponents to war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Mm. So you did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What do you plan to do next?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Nothing much different from what I'm doing now. I'll continue to protect Wratharis as a knight. There's still a ways to go before her wishes are completely fulfilled, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Wh-what? Did I say something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Not at all. I just think she'd be very pleased with that answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>O-oh. Well, it's your turn now! What will you be doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Mmm... Something only those who've survived the harshest of battles can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If we're to end all wars, we have to look toward the future. We can't be fixated on the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Hmm? What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hold that side! Lift on three, okay? Here we go! One... Two... Three!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>We did it! Nice work. Now the people of this village can get to the main road!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Right, but why are we knights of Envylia helping Wratharis rebuild? It doesn't make a lot of sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I understand how you feel, but you heard our captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Now that the war has ended, Envylia is hoping to form an amicable bond with Wratharis. We are to be the bridge facilitating that bond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Both countries have been scarred by the fighting. People on both sides of the border are sure to resent the other in some way. But we have to look beyond that and find our common ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Besides which, turning a blind eye to those in need isn't exactly the knightliest thing to do, now, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You're absolutely right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Would you look at that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>If you hate, all you receive is hate in return. If you rage, all you see is anger from those around you. It's a never-ending cycle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>(The wounded hearts of the people are gradually healing. However, the eyes of those who lost loved ones still show a dark shadow of animosity within them.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>(And although the fighting may have ended here, there are still battles taking place in distant lands, forever changing the lives of the people who live there. Which is why...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>(...I will keep your will to end all wars alive in my heart. I will end the fighting through whatever means I can.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>All right, everyone! Still a lot of rebuilding left to do, so let's keep at it! How about we take this over to—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>W-wait! Don't move that yet! It'll lose balance and—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Huh? Whoa! Aaaaaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>The road to peace is not an easy one to tread. Especially now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Phew! I'm glad you came back, Kalmia. Thanks for pulling me out of harm's way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>When you focus on one thing, you still can't quite see the forest through the trees, can you, Priscilla?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Hey, that's not nice! But, whatever; there's actually something I wanted to show you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Oh? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It's over here! Come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Is this...a garden? Did you make this? When did you even find the time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Lamia was saying she wanted to plant flowers, so we did just that, together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I know there are more important things that need to be rebuilt first, but...I couldn't quite resist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I just thought people might want something nice to look at in times like these. What do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You're right. There are definitely other things that should've been prioritized over this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Urgh... I knew it! It was a terrible idea, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Actually, I think it was a lovely thing to build. Thanks to you knocking this ahead on the list, these flowers can now help the people feel at peace, if but for a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Besides, the more time people spend admiring the flowers, the less time they'll spend on hate, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Yes... Yes, that's exactly right! I knew you'd understand.</td>
</tr>
