<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I was always alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>She was the one who saved me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>My only friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I will save her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No matter what...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I want her to smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>For that to happen... I need the power to save her...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Here and now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Nngh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Where...am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, good. It looks like it was successful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm Lakina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm the one who called you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Called me here? What do you mean? What is this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm the one who called you, but I can't imagine what great twist of fate may have brought you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Anyway, what's your name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>My name is Toritoh. Introducing myself properly is difficult, however...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The Holy Order called me General.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh! You're from the Holy Order?! So that's how you ended up here. This should be easier to explain, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This is the world inside the Sacred Stone Lucifer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>There is something I have to do no matter what, so I want you to help me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>W-wait just a moment! A world...? Inside of Lucifer?! What is the meaning of this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>To put it simply, this is the world between life and death. All things that die pass through the world that Lucifer created.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>They get filtered here, so to speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well...I am dead, I know that much, but your explanation really doesn't clear up much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>First of all, why do you know so much about Lucifer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>A single Sacred Stone can shake a country to its core... Why do you know so much about these stones when even I don't?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Because I'm the Captain of the 7th Regiment of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You're a member of the Holy Guard?! And a captain, at that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I've never heard of the 7th Regiment, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's not a surprise. It's one of the Holy Guard's... No, the world's...great secrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'll tell you about it, about the group I belong to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The regiment of one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Lord Zain, where are we? What is this strong Alchemia I feel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Lakina... I beg your forgiveness, but there is a responsibility that I must entrust to you, even at this young age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Here and now, I appoint you as Captain of the Holy Guard's 7th Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The 7th Regiment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Only the Lord Commander and the council's Most Reverend Bishop know of its existence. Here...look at this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wait, is this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yes. It's the Sacred Stone Lucifer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The 7th Regiment was founded to keep its power under control, with this stone being handed down over the years to the next captain of the regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>To sacrifice their whole being for the sake of holding back the power of "Pride" and protecting the world order, that is the job of the Captain of the 7th Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>To protect the world order?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Spawned from the seclusion of this Sacred Stone is the sin of Pride...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Lucifer sorts the souls of those that have passed, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>In the world born of Lucifer—the world between life and death—souls who succumb to the stone's influence will meet their doom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The strong souls who don't give into this power gain the right to become phantoms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You can't be serious... But...power like that—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>To keep those souls it deems worthy bound to this world...such is the power of "Pride."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Among the powers of the Sacred Stones that are already known, this power stands apart, and we, as members of the Holy Order, have a responsibility to protect the world from it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>No one knows what kind of chaos the Sacred Stones might bring if it becomes publicly known how directly they relate to alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Seven countries on the Continent of Babel and each country has a Sacred Stone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>That's right. That's why the Holy Guard is stationed in all seven countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I see... That's why the headquarters of the Holy Guard and the Holy Order are in Northern Pride, where Lucifer is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It's helpful that you catch on so quickly, Lakina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I get the gist of it, but how do we keep Lucifer under control?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Those who are close to death are forcefully pulled into the world of Lucifer—physical body and all—by the power of Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That's the terrifying thing about Lucifer... If it's overlooked, what do you think will happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Lives that could otherwise certainly be saved would be lost. Lives that should still continue on would be extinguished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That's right. That's why those who are adept in alchemy are assigned to Lucifer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>They regularly pour their Alchemia into the stone to keep Lucifer's focus on them. You could almost call them managers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>They keep Lucifer's Pride under control, and to the best of their abilities, keep the unnecessary deaths to a minimum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Which protects the world order...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>And that's why my life...will be spent here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>If you agree, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I think this may just be the workings of fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Lord Zain, I would be honored to take on the captaincy of the 7th Regiment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Then, I was summoned as a phantom?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yes. I wasn't sure whether I'd be able to summon you here or not, but it seems you have a stronger soul than most.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I would expect nothing less of someone referred to as General among members of the Holy Order. Perhaps this is also fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Is that really the truth, though? You took on this self sacrificing mission all alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Yes. In a comparison between my life and the world order...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>It is obvious which is more important, is it not? I knew it had to be fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>That may be the case, but I can't agree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Lives are not something that should be left to fate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You can't just let yourself become a victim! You can't allow yourself to be someone else's scapegoat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Don't try and wrap everything up with a nice little bow by calling it fate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Toritoh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Someone in my past fought tooth and nail to teach me to reject that kind of mentality...so I refuse to believe that everything is determined by fate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I don't know for sure if I'm one to talk...but I still won't simply sit back and let someone live that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I won't ask the details of your circumstances, but I do thank you for getting upset on my behalf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I feel I can trust you, so please, lend me your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Before that, tell me something: You're the manager of this stone's power, correct? Why are you in here yourself, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>If this is the world between life and death, does that mean you've died as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Well, not exactly, but...it's hard to explain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Of course, since you're lending me your strength, it would be best if I explain everything to you in full.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Hm... All right. Where should we start?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Hn...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Phew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>(Doing this every day, alone... Going toe to toe with Lucifer...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>(To face the power of Pride that could consume me if I let my guard down...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>(I cannot let that power grow out of control. That much is certain, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>(It's a bit lonely.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Thank you. You can just set the daily necessities down over there, as always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Sorry, but I'm not your average Holy Order pleb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>What? Who...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Who are you?! How do you know about this place?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>There's no need for names because this is where you die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
