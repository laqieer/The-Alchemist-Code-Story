<td>- Goetia, Slothstein Branch -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>She's still unconscious, huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'll leave her in your capable hands, then. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The Goetia doctor bows and exits, leaving Emrys alone with his thoughts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(To think I'd be reunited with Eira like this...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(What was she doing in that mansion?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>A small sound coming from the throne room prompts Emrys to flatten himself against the wall and listen in silence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(A guest? At this hour?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They come for our prize, my Queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I daresay they will have found...alternative entrances into our abode.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>As rats do, I suppose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I expected the Holy Guard, but the meddlesome courtesan as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>She must be taught her place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Gladly, my Queen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>They won't want to leave after what I'm about to do to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(Pursuers, hmm?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(Guess I should look into it myself.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>- Underground Sewers -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ugh, I definitely don't miss this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Far better than being welcomed with steel and lead, at any rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Meep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Haaah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wait. Did you hear that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>A shuffling sound issues forth from around the corner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>*sniff sniff* Meep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Stop pacing, Roxanne. You're giving me a headache.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm...I'm sorry. I just can't sit still knowing they've got Soren AND Eira...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And we've got no way of contacting the outside world—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Meep! Meep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Chip!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wait, how did you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Little guy's got an uncanny ability to slip past almost everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You've seen better days, Rox.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>No thanks to you! Where in Babel have you been!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>With Shion, no less!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Shhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Shion removes a hairpin and smiles wryly, gesturing to the lock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You can ramble to your heart's content when you leave this sorry cell behind, Miss Roxanne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Assuming you can make it out quietly, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Shion, I'll keep him occupied.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(It's that man I passed on the street some days ago... The one who looks similar to...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hold your hostilities. I mean you no harm...for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>My name is Emrys. I only want to know why my sister was at your mansion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You're Eira's blood-brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The resemblance is quite uncanny...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>How do we trust you won't bring the whole base down on our heads?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Considering I caught you in the act of jailbreaking, it would have been an easy matter to call the guards instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Please, I need to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If Eira can fight for you so fiercely, you must be important to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>So that's what the explosion was. Eira was defending Soren!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Why would she do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>We met her at Tröstendorf, a village north of Lustberg. She was living out in the forest, relying on scraps to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Soren helped get her Alchemy under control. She thinks of him as a brother, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>She came all this way to visit him, and the rest, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>(...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>We can speak later, in less hostile environments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I don't know where Soren was taken, but this base isn't that big.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'll create a diversion and buy you as much time as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Wait. I'll go with you. Make it seem like you caught me skulking around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The rest of you go on ahead and find Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>All right. Give me a good show, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Don't get yourself killed, dummy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hah! If only I had a zeni for every time you said that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>End of the line, fool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You won't get out alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Bah! Your security is garbage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Well, well, look who it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hello again, Prince Charming. And there's the handsome fox who's been in our employ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...Madam Eliza. I have everything under control—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Count me surprised, Emrys. You act about as well as you lie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>And I was just thinking of sharing a secret with you. About your sister's disappearance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Seeing as you're so ungrateful as to consort with rats, however, I'm afraid our little partnership is off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Nesha, if you would be so kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Oh, how I LOVE naughty little sinners.</td>
