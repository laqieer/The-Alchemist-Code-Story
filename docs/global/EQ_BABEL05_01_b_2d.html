<td>You weren't half bad back there. I suppose that's only to be expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You... You, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Will. Well, that's Mister Will to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No, uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No need to feel shy. We're friends! Call me Will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No! Could you stop? That's not what I'm asking at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wow... You don't beat around the bush, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Nope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I love it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ugh. Troublemaker, huh? More like troublesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Whatever. Thanks, I guess... For saving me back there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Eh. I'm sure you would've been fine on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes, but you saved me a bit of trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Heh. You say that, but you know that you were the one stirring the pot, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>People in this country often forget, but Alchemy is a forbidden art, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Use of Alchemy is restricted to those few who have gained access to it through the proper channels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And these ruins... Do you even know what they are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I said, no. I have no idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's why I'm here. I wanted to learn more about them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm...looking for my brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ah. The one with the same hair color as you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Do you know something about him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's not the issue here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>My purpose here is these ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>These ruins...and you, Albea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I think it might be best if you went back to your...tinkering and forgot all about this little research expedition of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>For your own safety, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You... Are you going to try to kill me like those other people did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Aw, don't lump me in with boring grumpy-pants like those guys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm just saying that you might be better off continuing to...not know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Stubborn, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm with that girl on this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's impossible to understand something if you don't learn about it! It's pretty cold of you not to share what you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Who...are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Me? I'm Mira! Such a great name, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Mira... How long have you been here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I didn't sense your presence at all. It's almost as if you just...appeared out of thin air.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huh? I've been here for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Seriously?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Come on, pineapple head! Just tell her what she wants to know! Look at that face! How could you say no to that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Pineapple...? Tch, I don't have anything to tell her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Of course you do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>About Alchemy! And about what you saw in these ruins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>About the Cursed Beasts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Cursed...Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Y-you know about the Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Oh! So they are still around! Eheh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Answer my question, little girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What was it that you said? "You might be better off continuing to...not know"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>How about a trade?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>A trade? For what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Information, silly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I don't think so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Look, I already told you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Listen here, Mira. This Will guy is gonna tell you whatever you want to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You don't get to decide that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Fine. Then kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You won't do it, will you? Well, in that case, I'll do as I please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You'll just have to deal with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I'm just saying that maybe we should negotiate a little more before you offer up what I know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Ready? Question number one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Will, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Look, I'm telling you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>What time period are we in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I... What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Has the world ended yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Um, are you...? What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Was it all...for nothing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>For what reason did we go to war with each other?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>For whom does Alchemy exist?</td>
</tr>
