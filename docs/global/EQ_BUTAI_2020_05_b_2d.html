<td>Oh, but I am. They don't call me a chivalrous fool for nothing.</td>

<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You didn't reply. Instead, you gripped that dagger in your shaking hands and slowly stepped towards me.</td>

<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>——! ———!</td>

<tr>

<td>As you advanced, your soundless voice escaped through your chattering teeth.</td>

<td>———?!</td>

<td>I've left... instructions. I'll just be retiring for... a little while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>———!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You swallowed your words and aimed your dagger at my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I grabbed your wrist to stop you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This isn't want you really want, is it?</td>

<td>——! ——!</td>

<tr>

<td>——! ————!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I took your hands in mine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That's good enough for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>And guided them to plunge your dagger into my chest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>———!</td>

<td>My name... is Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Sol?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm another blank, just like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I think you got the wrong address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>So whatever you sent... it's going to come right back to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>That's a... shame...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The Sacred Sword, Excalibur... I'd like to take it in hand, just to see the looks on people's faces when a lowly thief from Lost Blue wields it against them—but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>———!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I'll take on your dying wishes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I appreciate it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I'll observe the world in your stead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>And if your successors can't cut it, I'll step in and pick up the slack. Should be easy pickings if your will is all for show.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Right...</td>

<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You've gotta be kidding me.</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>———! ———! ———!</td>

<td>I think I heard you calling for me.</td>
</tr>

<td>———... ———... ———...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yet my call for you, mingled with my dying breath, was lost to the sound of the rain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>———!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>But somehow, I know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'm only here because I wanted to express my gratitude. Here... This is for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>A... bookmark?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Surely your hatred of me doesn't trump your love of books?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>These pressed flowers... They're asters, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Will you accept it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Somehow, I can tell...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>——!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>That my words reached you all the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>——…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>My light...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I entrust it... to you.</td>

<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Just how long is it going to take to clean this place? I feel like I've been in here for years!</td>

<td>Northern Pride: Archives (Present Day)</td>

<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I bet there was so much more he wanted to tell us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>And even though he didn't get to, he wanted us to live on in his stead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I can appreciate that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>So... I think I understand what he intended with this diary a little better now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>There is too much darkness in this world for it to be fully—perfectly—illuminated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Some oceans are simply too deep for light to penetrate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I know that my own light will be extinguished one day, but I have faith in those I have entrusted with my legacy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>So long as there are those who long for the light, I believe that my successors will ensure that it reaches them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>They shall be the lights that guide this world to peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>The light that guides the world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>"This burden seems too great for me."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I will be the eleventh to take this seat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>So, like my predecessors before me, I must shoulder the weight of the Holy Guard's absolute justice. And yet, I fear it will be too much for me to bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>But I won't shy away from the mission you entrusted me with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Together with those who remain, I shall carry on your will, your hopes, and your dreams for this world, and achieve them in your stead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>We are the lights of this world, and until our dying breaths, we will continue to burn like stars—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>"—and shine brightly for all Babel."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Hey, Kanon! Quit spacing out already! Look at how much work there's still left to do! We'll be in here until we're old and gray at this rate! Hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>This is no laughing matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Please excuse him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Annoying, isn't he? I ought to bludgeon him to death with a book.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I know not whom this record is meant for...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Anyway—I wanted to talk to you about this diary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Only that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Lord Zain left it here, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I want it to be a tale that will make you smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>It was dedicated to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I guess you could say it's... his final love letter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>————.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Are you smiling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I never forgot you, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Not even for a moment. Your existence is carved permanently into my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>"Shhh."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Target in sight. Requesting further instructions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Capturing the Lord Commander is our top priority—dead, or alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>The former Captain of the 4th Regiment has been stripped of his status as a paladin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>In the Dark Wings of the "Stage" (Present Day)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Our intel suggests that the target has already made a pact with the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>The Magna Code clearly states that those who would bind themselves to the darkness must be purged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>We will slay him in the name of absolute justice. It is our duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I'm the one who struck down the embodiment of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Your heart has been swallowed by darkness, traitor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>I entrust it... to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>I'm the one who robbed Lord Commander Zain of his life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I know... you can do it. You embraced the darkness... no one is more qualified. You... and only you... can find a way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>You were a captain once! How could you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Carry on my... will. Spread light... throughout the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>I am the Demonic Spearman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Kudan...stein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Such reminiscences are useless to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>After all, there is no light within me. Fallen to darkness, I walk this world a shadow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>I am a deliverer of abandoned ideals...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>For darkness has no address.</td>
