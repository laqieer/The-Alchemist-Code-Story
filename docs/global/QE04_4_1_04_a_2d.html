<td>Why would it suddenly stop?!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This is perfect! All I need to do is slice its legs off and send its towering body to the ground! Then we'll have no need to climb its back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hyaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Keh! It's tougher than before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>His attacks aren't making a scratch! What's happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It doesn't look like it's about to move, either. In this state, we have no way of reaching our destination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Mocca, how do you read the situation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I might just be imagining it...but it looks like the dragon slows down after each spurt of fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It must take up an absurd amount of energy, so after each attempt, it has to rest before it can do it again...or maybe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The fire increases its body temperature to the extent that it needs time to cool down. It might even be able to harden its scales...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>To stop us from attacking it from the outside while it's recovering...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Then, let us return to the Wind Temple and flesh out a plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Call back Voda and Fuu, and together, we'll figure out how to reach the core and destroy it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What if it starts moving again while we're away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Rega, you keep a lookout. Report to us if you see the dragon move even the slightest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'd like to start moving some of the animals to safety in the meantime. Would that be okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I don't mind, as long as you stay near the Wind Temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Understood! Let's go, Kiki!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Georgios, you go with them, too! With your blade unable to breach the dragon's scales, we have no better solution than to rely on this plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hmph...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What's the matter, Tina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's nothing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Glurrrppp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Tch, looks like the dragon's current state has no effect on these! Get out of the way!</td>
