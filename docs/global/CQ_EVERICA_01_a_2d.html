<td>Would you ever want to join up with me? You know, like a partner?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Your...partner? But I'm still just a trainee...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It doesn't matter what you are. When we fought together, I could tell you had a keen eye for battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I bet teaming up would give us a real tactical advantage. So what do you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It... it means a lot to hear that from you, Hazel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'd love to be your partner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Being partners means you're equals. You play to each other's strengths while covering each other's weaknesses, like two parts of a whole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So when I say I'm counting on you, I mean it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hazel was one of the senior mercenaries. We had fought together a few times on the battlefield when she reached out to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>She was so strong. The way she dispatched her enemies in battle was a sight to behold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I really looked up to her. To have someone like that tell me she was relying on me made me so happy. It did wonders for my confidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And that's how we became partners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Since then, we've fought together in all kinds of battles, and we've always come out on top.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There were times when I thought I was done for, but she always got me through them. It was like as long as we were together, we couldn't lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Until...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...that battle changed everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We split up to try to corner the enemy...but she fell right into their trap. Her injuries were so severe that she lost all four of her limbs....</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...because of the plan I proposed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I was the one who decided that we would split up and try to catch them in a pincer attack. I thought we could take them alone, but I was wrong. It was my fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It was all...my fault. I thought I had a keen eye for battle. She put her trust in me. She relied on my judgments. And that's what happened to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If only I had paid more careful attention to the enemy's movements, then this never would have happened. She never would have... Hazel never would have...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Evelika</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Caris...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I hear you've taken on yet another dangerous assignment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Do you really think getting yourself brutalized like this will make your partner happy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We're mercenaries. No matter what happens, we are responsible for ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hazel was badly injured, but she is the one who bears that responsibility. Not you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Caris...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Thank you for saying that, but I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm...just completing my assignments as a mercenary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Evelika!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...This isn't like you. The way you fight...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yes. I am a mercenary...  And I complete my assignments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Even alone, I can still fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hiyaaaa!!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ha!!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Guh...!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>*pant*pant*pant*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Tch...! They're everywhere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Uuuuoooooo!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh...!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'm not going to die here...!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(Though...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(If this could be my atonement, then maybe...maybe this would be...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Don't give up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huh!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>!!??</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Guh!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Uwaa...!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Phew. Just in time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hazel!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Are you alright? What's going on? I've never seen you fight like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What...? What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Caris filled me in, and I came after you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Caris told you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>But Hazel, your body! What happened!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>We'll talk later. Right now we need to deal with these guys. Watch my back, ok?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...Of course!</td>
