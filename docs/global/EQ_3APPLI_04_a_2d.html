<td>Huh?! Did they disappear? What happened?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Why is it just the two of us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Since they're not from Babel...I think those two don't have too many memories of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Chloe, you have people here in Babel who still remember you...that's why you don't disappear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>No!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>No way... Is that the Rayvner?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'm not sure, but that's the enemy, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's right! Chloe, try to remember!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>My memory is hazy...and I can't remember clearly...but I understand they're the ones we must defeat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
