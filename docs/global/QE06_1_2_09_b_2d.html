<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I know, I know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Not getting along? Impressive that you still have the energy for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>The time will come for your powers to shine. Wait patiently for that moment to unleash it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>O-okay...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>How pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Captain Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So you noticed, did you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If you really intended to end this, you wouldn't have a problem against the Discarnate Power alone, not with the techniques of the Black Star up your sleeve.</td>

<td>Feel the wrath of my clan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Are you satisfied?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Somewhat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You did what you set out to do. That should be enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Is that what you would want to hear if you were in my shoes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Don't get cocky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's not over yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I know. I'm still not strong enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You impudent little brats! And you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You were the one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I did my part. There's no way you can win now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I hereby invoke the bars set upon the gates of the four gods. The shackles and forbidden gate shall be concealed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>All shall be bound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Grr... Aaaaaagh!!! I-I cannot move?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Great job, Azami.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You bought us just enough time to form the force field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Celis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You should always hide your ace up your sleeve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>How...dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You can't run now, demon. The tides have turned.</td>
