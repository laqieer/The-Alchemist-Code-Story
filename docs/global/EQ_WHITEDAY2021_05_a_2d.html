<td>Bleaugh... I second that revulsion.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hey, you lot! What're you doing?! Have you forgotten how much I'm paying you?! Do something about these monsters already—</td>

<td>GRAAAAWR!!</td>

<td>I've just been storing a large stock of marshmallows for the White Day Fair! But when I tried to take them out, suddenly—</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Right, okay. We get the picture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This could turn real ugly, real quick. We ought to dispose of these monsters before more arrive.</td>

<td>Tsuru? Tsuru, are you okay?! Your face is contorted in pain!</td>

<td>Roger. Come on, this way, Tsuru—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What? But the storehouse is that way. You want to run there? "We have to hurry and destroy that flour," he says...</td>
</tr>

<td>017</td>
<td>Hmm, it's not impossible with his speed, but not in this state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...All right, then. In that case, I'll go with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You sure about that? If Tsurubami ends up losing it—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It'll be fine. I believe in Tsuru.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Understood. We'll open a path to the storehouse for you. Just don't overdo it, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You have my thanks. Come, Tsuru, let's go!</td>
