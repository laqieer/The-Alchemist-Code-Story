<td>Phew... We managed to defeat them, but all this fighting is starting to take its toll.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You're right. Depleting all our energy will be foolish. Let's rest here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I hope there's water around somewhere. I'll look for a spring. Hold on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Um, Captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm sorry about just now. I should never have lost my cool like that during a mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Don't worry about it! More importantly, about that earlier question...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I do believe what Captain Cadanova said was true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Power won't solve anything. Only the heart of justice will overcome—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I told you; those are ideals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Something as uncertain as justice cannot suppress the darkness of the heart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The darkness of the heart...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>During the destruction of Wadatsumi, I witnessed the same hell that Kagura did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Having been there at the time for my studies, I fought as hard as I could with my few comrades, to protect the royal family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ultimately, only Kagura and I survived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I boasted more strength than any of the other knights present at the time. I was also confident that I could beat anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>However, I was completely powerless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No matter how much I wielded my sword or I took down the enemy, I couldn't stop the burning of the town nor the ruthless slaughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In the end, my power wasn't able to change anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It could neither protect Captain Cadanova nor Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's not true! You did do something. You saved Kagura's life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah, that's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>However, she remains one life in contrast to the countless people who were slain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I was unable to stop the destruction of Wadatsumi. As I tasted my powerlessness, I could feel the darkness swelling in my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I wanted to massacre all those devils who burned that beautiful forest and slaughtered those innocent lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That was the justice I desired to enforce.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I felt the same when the invasion ended, and no punishment was given to Greed Dike who had destroyed Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If something so outrageous were to be forgiven, then I, too, should be allowed to destroy Greed Dike with my own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I wanted to obtain enough power to punish Greed Dike and enforce my justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>However, I quickly regained my sanity. I realized that if I let this darkness engulf my heart, I too would be consumed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Thus, I forced myself to bury it deep within me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>To this day, I use my willpower to discard myself of all emotions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You understand now, don't you? Justice can't suppress the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Justice is malleable and can itself be tainted with darkness, as mine was then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Only power can counteract the darkness—overwhelming, pure, and all-transcending power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I don't believe that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>In fact, I'll shine the light of justice on you!</td>
</tr>
