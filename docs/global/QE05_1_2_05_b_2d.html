<td>W-wow, the two of you were able to chase all those monsters off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Fantastic as usual, Kamui! If only I could make use of Spiritbonding in the same way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ah, but if you could, perhaps you would not have practiced your swordfighting so diligently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>True! It's good that I'm only good at swordfighting, since I'm really bad at doing two things at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>By the way, Isidore... That sword...</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You noticed! I knew you loved me!</td>

<td>008</td>
<td>I went into the treasury this morning just for this beautiful sword!</td>

<td>According to legend, there was once a dragon as big as a mountain which was drawn to Sephiron's energy, and arrived with the aim to devour her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>In order to defeat the dragon, they gathered the wisdom of all in the village to create this blade made of Sephirium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Its name: the Dragonslayer! No foe can stand up to a blade which can cut down even a dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Is that really necessary?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, Kamui. There's not a romantic bone in your body. Come on, look at it! It's cool, right? Dragon! Slayer! No...? Nothing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Fine, fine... Well, more seriously, the villagers are getting quite concerned about what is happening out here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Gluttony Foss has been split into two, North and South.</td>

<td>Then a bunch of villages got burnt to the grou—</td>

<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Er, sorry. I didn't think before I spoke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's fine. I'm used to your lack of tact by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Urgh... Harsh, but fair...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>In any case, we should head out soon. I would rather not encounter a group of monsters like that at night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It should be this way! Over this hill, and then—</td>
