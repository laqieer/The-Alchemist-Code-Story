<td>Gaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>And fire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(It’s so easy to swing... It does exactly what I want it to. It’s like the weapon is an extension of my body!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(It really was too heavy... The expectations turned into pressure...just like she said.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(Oh, I see...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(I was saved by her words. By her sounds... All I could think about was moving forward, but she taught me something all the same.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(I’m not fighting alone. There’s someone by my side! This is probably the path Nina walked...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(I’ve accepted my own weakness... I’m going to begin fighting for myself. So I can become the best me I can!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I...will walk down my own path! This sword is proof of that decision!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...Phew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...That signal cannon shot and my resolve really motivated me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>“Sounds” are incredible... You were right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Sharon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Whoa! P-please don’t jump out at me like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ahahahaha! Your face is so red! Cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Please stop! ...I’ve completed my mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Thank you. I was able to find my resolve because of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...I should be the one saying that. Thank you so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yeah. You’re definitely at your cutest when you’re being honest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>C-cute?! I’m not...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I’m glad you’re safe, Little Sharon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Sorry about earlier... I said horrible things to you...but you still worried about me anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Because there was once someone who worked towards a future where humans and therians could help one another and laugh together...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We should be able to understand each other one day, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...That was Nina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I guess I’m not the only one who respects Nina and aspires to be like her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That’s right! We both look up to Nina. So let’s be friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>All right, let’s head back! Time to fire the “we’re home” shot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Thank you for your guidance...Instructor Bertha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh? Sorry, I couldn’t hear you over the sound of the signal gun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...It was nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What? Sorry, sorry. Say it again! Please?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...It’s a nice sound, isn’t it? The signal shot of victory. It doesn’t hurt my ears at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What?! Sharon couldn’t join the Scarlet Flame Guard?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Is it because she attacked the Wratharis army on her own?! Ahhh, I should’ve stopped her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Calm down. It’s not that she “couldn’t join,” she just “didn’t join.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...Of course, the decision she made wasn’t exactly praiseworthy. However, she got the drop on the Wratharis army and created an opportunity for us to defeat them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...You could say that her value increased even more after this incident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You gave her that sword, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That’s right. That other one was still too heavy for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>She’s just like you. Heh, you’re a pretty good instructor now. You were able to overcome it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes, probably... So where did Sharon end up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Both the Scarlet Flame Guard and Blue Flame Guard wanted her to enlist with them... However, because of Sharon’s strong wishes, she was assigned to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The Royal Knighthood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What?! She’s going to join us...instead of going to the Scarlet Flame or Blue Flame?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I have to go ask her about this! Please excuse me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Sharon! ...Good, there you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What’s wrong, Instructor Bertha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I’m not your instructor anymore... I’m not sure I was able to teach you anything, either...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Teaching others is not really my thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I learned many things from you. So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...I’m glad you were my instructor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Sharon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Oh, but...I came to ask about your assignment. Are you really okay with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Oh, that. Regardless of which knighthood I join, they all share the same goal of protecting Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>So since that’s the case, I...wanted to fight by your side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>B-by my side?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yes, I believe I still have many things to learn from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...I’m greatly indebted to you. I want to pay you back little by little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Also, I thought I’d have more opportunities to interact with the Envylia Orchestral Band if I was a member of the Royal Knighthood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>But...what about your aspirations?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>They haven’t changed. But, I learned that going my own way doesn’t mean I’m going against my aspirations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I want to walk my own path. Your signal shot gave me a shove in the right direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...I’m happy to hear you say that, but... Hmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...No, I’m happy! I can fire an “we’re home” shot for you again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I’m happy too, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Oh, your sound... Heheh, what good timing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>This “sound” is the sound that supported you, right? It’s a nice sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>The parade has started.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Ahhhh! Oh no! I forgot they’re debuting the new song! Patty will be so angry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The new song... Can I come hear it later?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yes! Of course you can! All right, see you later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Part of protecting the country is protecting “sounds” as well as people... That’s the duty of Envylia’s knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>That’s why I want to keep swinging this sword. I will surpass the person I admire while walking down my own path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I look forward to working with you...Instructor Bertha.</td>
