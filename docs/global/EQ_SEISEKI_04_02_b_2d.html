<td>001</td>
<td>Ugh...agh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I see. Your bravery is not unfounded. Your dexterity is impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>However...you chose the wrong opponent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ack...I'm still not done yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Enough. The contrast in our abilities exudes from our bodies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I won't have you underestimate me! Compared to that fight...these can hardly be called scratches!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'll warn you that if you endure any more injuries, it'll have lasting consequences. You may die, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm well prepared for that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Are you back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yes! I felt that something serious was going on so I ran back as fast I could!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>More importantly...what this?! Who is this girl?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm not a girl, I'm Suzuka! And who do you think you are?! Don't get in the way of our battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What do you mean battle?! You're just one-sidedly taking blows!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It'll be dangerous for you to continue any further. I don't know what's going on, but you've lost. Now put down your sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's nonsense! I still haven't been defeated! My sword is still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ughh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>See. What did I tell you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ack...you villain! Getting in my way...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You can hardly stand. Quick, you need to look after your injuries before it's too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's dangerous; get back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Enough with this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Lord Commander Zain is busy right now! Can't you tell?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If you want to challenge someone, you must choose the time and place! When you're going about things hectically, it's hard to go easy on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Go easy on me...?! I never...agh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I've lived my life with just one goal: to become the best blademaster of my time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I learned to hold a sword before chopsticks. Both night and day I continued to practice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Even after I was acknowledged as a first class blademaster...I continued to travel and challenge others in order to hone my skill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So why can't I even get a single blow in without being hurled miserably to my defeat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ah, is that what you're worried about? The answer is easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Your sword is lightweight, especially when compared with Lord Commander Zain's sword. It's just that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You little...! How dare you stick your nose in other people's business and pretend like you know everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I saw more than enough. Besides, you just said yourself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>All this time...you've been fighting on your own, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You want to become the greatest blademaster of your generation. I think that's a wonderful dream, and I think you might actually be able to achieve it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But...the way you are now, I don't think it's possible. After all, you're only using your power for yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Only for myself...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The look on your face says that's to be expected, but...that's not the case for Lord Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Lord Zain's sword is the Lord Commander's sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Each blow he deals must be stronger, faster, and more accurate than anyone else in the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>He seeks to save the continent, to carry the lives of thousands on the blade of his sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That's why...at any time, any place, he can't afford to lose to others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Can you stop this weight with your sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Is your power enough to beat a sword that carries the will of countless people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Umm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I...I give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Okay! That concludes this challenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What is your name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I see...Su-Suzuka.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hey... Suzuka. Why don't you come again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You're not a Lord Commander, so you may not be able to carry the lives of thousands on the blade of your sword, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'm sure that you'll be able to obtain your own strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>When the time comes you can just challenge him again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Lord Zain isn't the kind of person to run away. I'm sure he'll accept your challenge again. Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Oh...yes, but I'd prefer if it was when I have more time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>See! So let's heal your wounds properly first! I'm going to help you bandage them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Tsk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>All right. It's done! Don't push yourself too hard anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I thank you, Kanon. You prevented me from killing unnecessarily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Come on, Lord Zain! I'm sure that wasn't your intention!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ka-Kanon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>S-so you're Kanon?! The Paladin who drove Zangetsu, my eternal rival, to the ground?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>U-um, yeah, but...it was all thanks to Capitan Kudan and Kagura...and stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I know that this might be too forward...I don't mind if it's just for now...but would you please keep me by your side?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>B-by my side?! What are you saying all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I know I am unworthy! I am painfully aware of my own inadequacy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It was brash of me to attempt to challenge you, Kanon, and the Lord Commander when I am only just as strong as Zangetsu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>As both of us are women, I want to know the source of your strength and gallantry that allows you to hold your own men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Please teach me this and let me stay by your side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I-I'm not sure...what do you think, Lord Commander Zain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It shouldn't be a problem. We have a long and difficult fight ahead of us. Every additional friend who stands by our side is a blessing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Bu-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I'll say this once again if you insist on not allowing me to accompany you at your side...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Then I'll end my own life here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Why do you have to be so extreme?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Seriously...fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I don't think there's anything I can teach you, but if I leave you on your own there's no knowing what you'd do to yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Th-then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Yes. Let's fight together, Suzuka!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Thank you, mistress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Huh?! Hey, why are you calling me mistress?! Stop it! I don't like that title!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Why?! I have acknowledged you as a worthy individual to whom I will serve. Of course, I will call you, mistress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Knock it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Oh, my mistress! Please, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Kanon has the power to almost unfairly draw people to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>She is quite different than me and Cadanova. She may be the more worthy one for this day and age.</td>
</tr>
