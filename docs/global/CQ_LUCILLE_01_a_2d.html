<td>Yes! Did it! I love making weapons! It's the best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What in the world...? Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I am Suiran. I’m a blacksmith from Wadatsumi. I am looking for the blacksmith Lucia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Uh... That's me. What can I do for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh! Nice to meet you! Recently, your weapons have been the talk of the town—among blacksmiths, at least. I wanted to stop by and take a look at your workshop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So you're a blacksmith as well, huh? If you don't mind me asking, what's with that giant hammer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is what I use to smith. I employ various mechanisms on this hammer to make my weapons. What do you use, Lucia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wow, that's so interesting! I've never seen anything like that. I guess every blacksmith has their own style! As for me, I don't use any tools.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What? How can you smith without tools?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, I'll show you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There we go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Th-that's...amazing! It was like the iron had a life of its own—like it just shaped itself into something new. It's more like magic than blacksmithing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm sure that your weapons will just keep getting more and more popular...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yeah? It's totally normal to me, though. Whatever! Let me see your hammer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wow, wow, wow! So how do you use it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm surprised you don't know! While the iron's hot, I shape the weapon by striking it like "clank, bang, clunk!" and "wham, bam, thunk!" I'm really proud of my hammer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I like to keep things simple, so I always use my hammer to make my weapons and it's done in a jiffy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>As much pride as I take in my work, more than anything, I just love seeing my clients happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So long as they are pleased with my work, I’m satisfied, even if I'm making a weapon that will be used for war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh? I don't get that mindset at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I don't think about that stuff. I just make what I make because I think it's fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What? That's no good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>A weapon that's made with that kind of unfocused feeling can never be good, no matter how popular it might be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I don't know. I think what I make is pretty great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>There's no way that your arms are better than mine, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>How dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I guess I have no choice but to prove my weapons are the best by defeating you in battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Fine. Let's go outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Don't forget, the winner is the one with the better weapons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I know, I know! There’s no way I’m losing to you!</td>
