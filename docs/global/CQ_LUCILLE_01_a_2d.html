<td><img src="../img/portraits/lucl.png" alt="Lucia" height="128"><br>Lucia</td>
<td>Wow, that's so interesting! I've never seen anything like that. I guess every blacksmith has their own style! As for me, I don't use any tools.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suir.png" alt="Suiran" height="128"><br>Suiran</td>
