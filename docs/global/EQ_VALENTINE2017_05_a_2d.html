<td>Wow, we really got our effort's worth... That being said, what's up with those monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Is its effect really that powerful? I wonder what is attracting the monsters?</td>

<td>Didn't that one go rushing towards the purple cacao? What was purple again?</td>

<td>Um, purple was captivation...? Do you think they're being captivated?!</td>

<td>Oh! You know how they have the arrows for monsters that charm them? I was wondering how that works, but maybe they paint some of this on them!</td>

<td>That makes sense...these monsters can be pretty smart...</td>

<td>So, they use them not as a love potion but in combat...</td>

<td>Well, in this world, when it comes to 'charm effects,' it's not so much a, 'Oh my god, I love that guy!' kind of effect. It's a little more scary and unusable than that, isn't it?</td>

<td>Totally.</td>

<td>Anyway, let's manage the purple cacao a little more carefully at the plantation...or in each country as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hm? Even as we speak...here comes more of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Let's just get rid of them first, so we can enjoy Valentineâ€™s Day!</td>
