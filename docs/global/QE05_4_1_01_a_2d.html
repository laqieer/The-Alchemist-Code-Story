<td>Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>So that is the end of that... For now, I suppose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Seems like it. Hmph. I even left the city to try and stop their pursuit, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I didn't expect them to keep up this onslaught. Time and place don't seem to mean much to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Corpse... The dark side of the Holy Guard. Looks like they've got expendable fodder aplenty, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Corpse has their fingers in every pie, from important seats in the offices of every country in Babel, to places among the ranks of the knight orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Only a select few are privy to the big picture, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>And you are one of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Now you've turned your back on them. Why the hell would you do something like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That is irrelevant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I have my own objective. We had a disagreement, nothing more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I expect you'll pay for that one of these days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmph. You think I would lose to those fools?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>They're an enormous organization, on par with nations—that's like going toe-to-toe against a colossal beast with a will of its own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Nothing they do, whether it be good or bad, can be stopped by just one person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's good to be proud of your strength, to be able to rely on it. However, it is foolish to underestimate one's enemy as a result of that confidence. It won't end prettily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Tch. I don't want a lecture from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I am doing what I think is right. No more, and no less. Should that take me down a path that is difficult to traverse, then so be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hmmm... So no one who can contest that strong will of yours has appeared before you yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You are an unfortunate fellow in some ways, young man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We have finished making room for the wounded, sir. Sorry for troubling the two of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. You've been good to my cousin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hmph. I thought she was still a child, but then she went and crossed the desert all by herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Seems like she's finally got some sense of self-preservation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Heh, look at you! Who knew you had a soft side?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Anyway, why haven't they come back yet? Kamui and the others should be here by now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>There isn't much to gain by hanging back. If we're meeting up, it's better to do it sooner rather than later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>According to the scouts' report, Gluttony's army has crossed the border.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If we go back to the city, we could at least provide a diversion so that—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No, not yet. Now isn't the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What do you mean? Are you just going to sit back and watch them slaughter the people of the desert?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Why do you think they are invading the Desert Zone in the first place? What do they have to gain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That's... Well, now that you mention it... Not much, I guess. They've still got the civil war going on in Gluttony Foss, don't they? Why are they sending soldiers all the way out here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>They have the same objective as Corpse does... Is that what you're trying to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hmph. Clever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Corpse rarely makes their moves obvious. Yet this time, they have done just that. It was almost as if they knew that Gluttony Foss would invade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>They aren't the only ones. You appeared, too, as if you had foreseen it all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Both Corpse and Gluttony Foss are seeking the same thing—and what is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>They want to get their hands on a druidic priestess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Then there's the group that Marie called the Collectors of Wisdom... Don't tell me this Corpse or whatever wants Marie, too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>All of this has come from the lingering vestiges of the vision of one man. It amounts to nothing more than nonsense spouted by a deluded fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>As the survivors of an ancient race that is now all but lost, it is up to us to cleanse this filth from their minds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Now, as for what happens next...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I expect Gluttony's forces will prepare for their second invasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>They certainly faced some losses, but it will only take a week for reinforcements to arrive from the royal capital. We should expect that that will be all they will need to regroup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>They may—no, because they have suffered such a large and brilliant defeat here today, they will—dig in their heels all the more. Not to mention that even now we're at a huge disadvantage in terms of numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We may have won the day, but that day will soon end. This is merely my opinion, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I agree with you. There are no fortresses or citadels in the desert that require resources on a large scale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The climate is in our favor, but that alone won't help us push back their army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Then what're we gonna do? Even if we keep poking, we'll just end up getting ourselves killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Right. That's why we have no option but to go on the offensive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The Gluttony army may have the numbers, but those numbers will also serve to slow them down. We need to decide the battlefield for ourselves and get there first, so that we can get the jump on them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You wanna set up some kind of guerrilla warfare? There's nowhere to hide in the desert, though. I guess we could just keep hitting them at night...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You're right about catching them unaware, but our target won't be the Gluttony army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>We're going to attack the jewel in Gluttony Foss' crown, the royal capital itself... Eos.</td>
</tr>
