<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hmph. Ran off with their tail between their legs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Um, so... Mister Gormalas?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Just Gormalas is fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>All right, Gormalas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm Tomas! This is Fons—the bigger one—and Reeves is the smaller one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So, were they acquaintances of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Nah. Never saw those guys in my life, but I’m not surprised they knew me. Probably seamen of some sort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Seamen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yeah, the sort that aren't honorable, but aren't complete good-for-nothings, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Like...former pirates?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If I had to guess, I’d say they were probably pirates that I got the better of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wow! You're seriously strong, huh, Gormalas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, hey! I forgot to thank you for your help just now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You even offered your help when I was at the pharmacy. Seriously, thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You've got it all wrong. I'm not the charitable sort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Then why did you help me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hah! You're still just a kid, huh? You've got a lot to learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I never help anyone out of the goodness of my heart. There's always gotta be something in it for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Something like what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Something worth the work I've put in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Worth? Uh... I don't know if I really have anything like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I don't think I'll be able to pay you back for helping me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I don't know about that. You definitely have something worth my time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Tch. You might regret being so bloody innocent one of these days, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Heh! Anyway, this is pretty exciting for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I can’t believe I bumped into my hero twice in one day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Uhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I wanna explore the world! That's why I've always looked up to you, Gormalas! We’re both from Saga, too! Hehe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I've never even seen the ocean! Maybe I should become a pirate, too! Haha, just kidding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Tch... There's gotta be limits to how naive a kid can be. You can't just joke around about becoming a pirate like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Your fighting style isn't half-bad, but it needs a hell of a lot more polish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>And fighting out on the open seas isn't anything like fighting on land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>There're completely different techniques and strategies you need to know. The way you are now, you wouldn’t last a week before you’d be sleeping with fishes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>On top of that, a pirate's got to be smart. Strength'll only take you so far. If you don’t have the brains to back it up, you’re gonna end up getting swallowed up by the sea sooner or later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What? Got nothing to say? Heh. I guess you hadn't thought of that, aye, boy? It's not an easy business, pirating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Um, so by brains, do you mean that I should study more or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'll definitely train more! And I'm not good at studying, but I'll do my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>R-right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What should I study? Like, to become a great pirate like you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Heh. Less talk, more action, huh? You’ve got the right attitude. Your eyes, though. Hmph... They’re still too soft.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Uh... They're just a normal blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh! I've been told that they're the color of the ocean! The ocean's blue, too, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>And I heard that the water in the ocean is salty! How do fish live in salty water? That's so weird!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ugh... That childish innocence of yours is starting to make me feel sick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I mean, sure, I'm sure there are places where the ocean is just clean and bright like that, but it's not that simple up in the northern seas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>There, the waves are so vicious that it makes it difficult to make food, let alone sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>And I don't know how many times I've seen ships where sailors died just because the voyage went on longer than expected and food ran out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Do you think you could handle that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Uhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Seems like this has knocked some sense into you, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>No, I just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Grrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Fons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>There! I told you, it's Gormalas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hah! Fools! I should've put you out of your misery while I had a chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You'll pay for what you did to us earlier! Let's see how you do now that you're outnumbered!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>This will be our revenge for you stealing our pirate flag!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>This is the end of the road for you, you miserable cowards! This is what you get for running from the seas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
