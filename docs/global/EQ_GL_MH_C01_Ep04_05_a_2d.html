<td>Hey, I found a set of stairs. Looks like they go underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Assuming this is an old tomb... a burial chamber, perhaps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Only one way to find out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hmm. It's not as ancient as I thought. It smells... sharply sterile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Like spilled chemicals, or some other odd substance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Maybe it has to do with those weird storage tanks over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And are those... monitor displays?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I don't think we're in a tomb, honestly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wait, what's... that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Roxanne peers over at a small heap of humanoid corpses strewn haphazardly across the floor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Eerily enough, they are completely drained of blood, and are now little more than dried husks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ugh. How long have these been down here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No idea. I can't tell when they were killed. They're too shriveled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Soren? Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>My head... hurts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(I've seen this... scene... before. But where? And... why?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Grrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Roxanne! Watch him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm on it!</td>
