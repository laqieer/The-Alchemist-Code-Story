<td>(We've managed to fight off the first wave. Still, the enemy's main army lies further ahead. When will they attack?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(It's difficult to fight when I'm not positioned at the vanguard.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There you are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You again...what is the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well, in the battle earlier...I was stunned by the way you led your men. That being said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I see the confusion amongst your soldiers now. With you usually at the vanguard, they are not used to this new formation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Are you still thinking about the scolding you received from your varlet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Lord Gane, why did you come all the way here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You are not my subordinate. There is no reason for you to be here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's true that I am not your subordinate... However, I am a knight. Isn't it natural for me to make a stand in battle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I see. That is true. Well then, tell me honestly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Why do you follow me? What is your goal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I am here to help you, my queen. How is that for a reason?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Do I look like someone who needs help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sigh... I guess that reason isn't convincing enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're are strong... And, indeed, you do not need my help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well then...I'll tell you my goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>My father is a Paladin. However, there's nothing about him that stands out in particular. Furthermore, he never commits blunders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>He's an honorable knight... I know that sounds good, but he truly is a harmless, mediocre human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I do not want to become like my father!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I will rise in the world! Yes! I will ascend all the way to becoming a king!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That is my hope! I will do whatever is necessary to achieve that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I have already gotten close to you...for this reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(So...he'll do whatever is necessary to achieve his goal...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Pww...pwahahaha!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What's so funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I found your whole speech quite stimulating! I appreciate your resolve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Here they come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Soldiers of Envylia! We are all in this together! Follow me. I am Lucretia, the Queen of Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Queen Lucretia...are you sure about this? You'll be scolded by your varlet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Who cares. I'll do things the way I want to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Gane! Follow me! If you wish to be my groom, then focus on the enemy before us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, my queen! I am your knight and I will accompany you to the ends of the earth!</td>
