<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We've finally managed to corner you! Come on! Give back the candy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes! Please, give it back. I can't afford for rumors to spread about my candy containing powerful mana!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Numu, numaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wait. Let's hear them out first! It may solve the mystery of this entire fiasco.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Usually...monsters won't enter a town. There must be...some reason behind their actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Numu...numu, numu, numu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmm. I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What did the Rattys say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They said they wanted to attend a human festival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>They became envious after seeing the humans eating candy and enjoying themselves so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>When they caught a whiff of the candy, they couldn't contain themselves any longer. By the time they came to their senses, they had already stolen the candy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It appears that this candy contains the effect of stimulating "the desire to enjoy Halloween."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I guess you can call it the power of Halloween. Usually, its effect would be limited to boosting the fun a little and not much beyond that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But their fascination with Halloween was too strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So...it sent them into a frenzy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So that's what happened...huh, Mia?! What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Sob... So that's what happened. I'm sorry...I didn't realize at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Actually, I think it would've been pretty difficult to realize what was going on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So...it appears monsters also have the desire to enjoy Halloween.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey, why don't you give them some candy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Just enough to make them feel better. I mean, it's Halloween after all. Right, Neica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Y-you're asking me?! I...well, as long as there isn't any strange mana inside of my candy then...I guess...it's okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What should we do, Hayate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What do you mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Our mission is to protect everyone's Halloween.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If the Rattys wish to enjoy Halloween then I want to allow them that pleasure, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I think it's fine. The townsfolk think that it's a costume anyway. They won't notice at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Heheh. She's right. I think we should do...what we must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What we must do...right! All right, everyone, let's distribute the candy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>U-Um... Can I go back to the house once? I'm thinking of making some additional candy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No! Neica, you're gonna pass out the candy with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Whaaat?! If I knew I'd have to do this...I would've worn a costume that hides my face completely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wow! Candy! Trick-or-treat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It looks so good! Give some to me too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hey! You guys have to wait your turn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Okaaay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(Both children and adults alike are enjoying Halloween. This is an amazing festival!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(We must protect the peace here...so that everyone can enjoy Halloween next year as well!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Numaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hey! You already got some just now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Have an amazing Halloweenâ˜†</td>
