<td>002</td>
<td>Haven't we suffered enough already?!</td>

<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The stomach's...glowing green. I suppose that's where we go next.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The last one is wind...right? Unless we do something about it, all their deaths would have been in vain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ack! I can't move! What terrifying power! It's beyond any storm I've ever seen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I can't budge at all... If we're attacked like this, we're finished!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We'll be killed at this rate! We've... We've got to come up with some kind of plan! Uraaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We weren't able to dispel it completely, but at least we can move now! Let's go take out the last core!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huff... Huff... Dang it! The wind's too powerful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Curses... Am I...not strong enough?! Am I too weak to deal with something like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Mocca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Tamis! No! Stay away! I'll handle this somehow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The Sprite Trio...are no longer with us anymore, I see. Fear not... I will take it on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You can't, Tamis! Not you, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Tamis...has the Wind Matter been restored?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No. I rushed all the way here when I felt the veil of wind shrouding the Sprite Trio fade away. I haven't been able to fully awaken it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What do you expect to do without it?! Tamis, I won't let you do this. I...I'll find a way to deal with it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Even without fully restored Wind Matter, I still have the Matter given to me by the Sprite Trio. I'm the only one who can handle this now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I've got to be the one to destroy the wind core! Even if I have to risk my life to do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What are you saying?! You can't sacrifice your life for this, Tamis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The Wind Matter has been infused with the power of the other three. I can funnel their power using the wind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If the wind's too meager...I'll compensate with my own life force! I need to do whatever I can to bring out the full power of the Wind Matter, or else every sacrifice so far will have been for nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I don't care what means I have to stoop to! It will all be worth it if there's even the slightest chance of fully awakening the Matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Haaaaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No! I won't allow it! I'll break my vow if I let you die! I swore I'd protect you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This is all we can do now...to fix this situation...and to ensure that no one's deaths here were wasted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There's no guarantee that destroying the wind core will lead to the dragon's defeat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Tamis! Don't do it! Stop, please! I can't take losing anyone else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Especially... Especially you, of all people! So please...don't do what you're planning to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? That I would do whatever it takes to restore the Wind Matter to its natural state... Besides, I've never been happier. I finally get to be of help to you, Mocca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We can't know for sure that I won't survive this...but I'll say it anyway. Thank you for everything. No matter what happens, please...live your life to the fullest, Mocca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Tamis, no! Don't go! Argh! I can't move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Guh! Tamis, wait! My legs won't budge... Move, dang you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Why...? Why did it have to turn out like this?! Come back! I don't want to lose anyone else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Tamis... You don't have to do this! Please, I'm begging you! Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Mocca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Please... Someone save her! I can't lose her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Tina... Please... Save...her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(She's so thin! It can't be... How come I've not noticed it before?! It's never even crossed my mind!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
