<td>Ooooh...</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Is this your first time in a city? It's quite the sight, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>many... things! Shiny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>For all their faults, humans do manage to create some truly impressive constructs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(Thankfully the humans here seem to lack magical aptitude, no one has been able to see through the illusion I cast over us)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(Still, we shouldn't wander for too long, it would be best not to draw any unwanted attention)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Shall we get going? It wouldn't do to keep your friends waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>*grumble* First Siegfried disappears off somewhere again, and now Soren and Blair leave on some trip without inviting me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And he still has the gall to ask me to take care of guests in his stead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Although he did seem kind of desperate... I just can't refuse him when he pleads with such sincere eyes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sigh... I guess I do owe him for all that trouble I put him through when we were preparing Blair's clothes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>*Knock Knock!*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That must be them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Soooo Adorable!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ahhhh, you're so fluffy! And cold! And what are these furry ears? Are they real?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>soft.... pillows.... can't... breathe</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(This lady, she can see through my illusions? Fufufu, she's a sharp one...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Greetings, I presume you are the owner of this mansion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Indeed, and you two must be the visitors that Soren told me he was expecting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ah, that is the acquaintance my friend and I are seeking. But first... could you perhaps let my companion go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>must... escape ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh dear, where are my manners! Your companion was just so adorable that I couldn't help myself, my apologies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That is quite understandable, she is such a darling after all. Her name is Eira, and you may call me Morrigan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Nice to meet the both of you, I'm Roxanne and a close friend of Soren, he practically treats this abode as his home...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>And he also did not mention that my guests will be quite so fetching! Now I feel rather unprepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh worry not, you are certainly more than adequate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Thank you. Now, unfortunately both he and Blair left for a research trip just this morning...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>He tried to tell you not to come, but apparently the little one hung up before he could get a word in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>... Big Bro... gone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh my, so our journey was in vain then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Not to worry, their trip is a short one, and they said they should be back by tomorrow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>In the meantime, Soren has asked me to play host and show you around the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm afraid we'll have to decline. We'd rather not wander around lest we attract unwanted attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Don't worry, no one in Slothstein would dare mess with me, and even if they did they'd soon regret it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Besides, the little one has never left her countryside home before, wouldn't this be a good opportunity to broaden her horizons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>... Eira, what do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>... if... Big Bro says...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>then... okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well, it seems we've reached a decision. It looks like we'll be taking you up on your offer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wonderful! There's plenty of fun to be had, so let's get going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>follow... Pretty Sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Awww, I love you already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I had a feeling it would be something like this, but... couldn't you have picked a place with less people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It's summer, so of course the beach is the place to be! It'll be a nice change from the frigid air where you come from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Besides, everyone is too busy having fun to take any interest in both of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Oh... the cold never bothered me anyways. Then again, it wouldn't hurt to live a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Eira... melting...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Come now, don't sweat the details. I know, lets head over to that beach stall and pick up a cold snack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hey girls, you seem a little lonely, how about you join us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yeah, we've got plenty of booze with us, let's have a great time together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>(Oh great, these type of fools. I wish Sieggy was here to get rid of them... ahhh, if only he were here with me...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hey lady, what's the deal, you're hurting our feelings here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It doesn't matter which of you comes along, if you're not interested, we'll just take this small cutie here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The thug grabs Eira by the arm and roughly pulls her</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...ah! Hurts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Release her at once fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Don't you dare hurt her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Oh yeah, or what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Watcha gonna do about it? A broad like you is better seen not heard, gwahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Oh no you didn't... Well, this 'broad' is about to change your mind!</td>
