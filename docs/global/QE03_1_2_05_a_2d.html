<td>I've only recently managed to ride a Broom Ace. I'm sure our teammates won't be satisfied unless you're the Face.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You know that Rebecca is going to be the Face of her team, right? It's got to be you, Liz!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But...</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Besides, our other teammates feel the same.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What?!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Liz, do you remember how you took out Rebecca's Battalion the other day?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>When I told the rest of them, they all placed a lot of expectations in you, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What?! They have expectations...in me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yep. It means that you're no longer a useless and inferior student.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I have high expectations for you as well, you know? All things considered, I doubt there's anyway I can beat Rebecca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If we're gonna do it, we all want to win. It's an honor to win the Sabbath, and it'll give us an advantage in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Liz, you carry all of that on your shoulders!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>O-okay...I understand! Let's do everything we can to win!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Um, excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Is this the audience entrance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Um, yes. You can enter from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Liz! The insects showed up again! Hurry up and guide that person so you can come back here and help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ohh! Please leave this to us and enter inside!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Thank you! Be careful!</td>
