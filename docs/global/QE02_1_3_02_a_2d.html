<td>Until just before the wedding ceremony, Ethan was imprisoned at the Beckram's mansion. That's what you said, right?</td>

<td>It happened about three months ago. Alvarez stormed into my family's house, bringing Alkaroids with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fion.png" alt="Fiona" height="128"><br>Fiona</td>
<td>He said, 'You've committed national treason by continuing to hide the presence of the Sacred Stone Belphegor, even though you knew the danger it placed our country in.'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>I see. Three months ago means about a year after he took over as mayor after Edward's death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>Might you say he was waiting for the suitable moment to take down the old Elester family?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fion.png" alt="Fiona" height="128"><br>Fiona</td>
<td>That may have been the case. Alvarez threatened me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fion.png" alt="Fiona" height="128"><br>Fiona</td>
<td>...not only with the destruction of the Elester family, but with the execution of everyone down to the servants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>That's a pretty aggressive way to go about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>But, wait. Alvarez's visit was to blame you for hiding the Sacred Stone, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>If you reverse engineer the situation, it means he knew the location of the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>Do you think the Beckrams had already gotten their hands on it at that point?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fion.png" alt="Fiona" height="128"><br>Fiona</td>
<td>I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fion.png" alt="Fiona" height="128"><br>Fiona</td>
<td>But, that's when Alvarez began to present me with conditions to save the Elester family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fion.png" alt="Fiona" height="128"><br>Fiona</td>
<td>He said to me, 'As I am the current mayor, if you become my wife, you can avoid the worst outcome.'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fion.png" alt="Fiona" height="128"><br>Fiona</td>
<td>He told me that I had no choice.</td>

<tr>

<td>Did you have a previous relationship with Alvarez?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fion.png" alt="Fiona" height="128"><br>Fiona</td>
<td>Me? No, I wasn't acquainted with him at all. I believe that was our first meeting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>Then we should assume he approached you to use you in some way. Perhaps to find out the location of the Sacred Stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fion.png" alt="Fiona" height="128"><br>Fiona</td>
<td>No, I have no such powers. I didn't even know about the existence of the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fion.png" alt="Fiona" height="128"><br>Fiona</td>
<td>In any case, Ethan was imprisoned because he tried to save me from the marriage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>So, seeing this situation, you made the decision to marry Alvarez to protect the people of the Elester family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>That explains the sorrowful expression on your face at the wedding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fion.png" alt="Fiona" height="128"><br>Fiona</td>
<td>I had...no other choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>Listen to me carefully. Women are born in this world to be happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>That's the only thing that should matter to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>You're not here to sacrifice yourself, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fion.png" alt="Fiona" height="128"><br>Fiona</td>
<td>Edgar...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>That's some moving stuff, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>Anyway, I doubt I'll be able to see eye to eye with this Alvarez guy regarding anything.</td>
</tr>
