<td>Wait... What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It looks like that stone Rochelle found at the ruins...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The same! Heh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's probably not exactly the same thing, but it definitely came from the same place.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Damn you!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't move. Who's behind all this?</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Give up. You're in over your head. You can't even begin to imagine how powerful the people involved in this are. Don't you dare think you can get away with—</td>

<td>Eek! Y-you thieves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Look who's talking. We have plenty of evidence of your deeds.</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ngh! Dammit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You all right there? Are you hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I-I'm...fine. Uhm... Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Are you sure? You're unusually...not energetic. I know things didn't exactly go as planned, but at least you can report good news to your chief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No! I mean, I am happy about that, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I just wish I was stronger.</td>

<td>Ishuna...</td>

<td>You really are honest and straightforward.</td>

<td>024</td>
<td>Right, Rochelle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I guess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Okay, fine, I'm alone on this one. I'm going to report our success to Chief.</td>

<tr>

<td>If you would, please.</td>

<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh, and thanks Glanz, Rochelle! Maybe you two can train me sometime?</td>

<td>Believe me or don't, but the more Izzy focuses on Chief, the less I belong.</td>

<td>What? What are you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Mixing white and black just makes gray. I cannot sleep when it's gray. It's dirty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But...I'm calm now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Okay. By the way, Rochelle, can I see that stone you picked up at the ruins? I want to compare it to what we found in the mansion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If Glizzy wants it, Glizzy can have it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Thank you. Hmm... They really are made the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The same! Heh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wait... If we combine them... Is this...a key?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>He's looking for some key for the ruins. He doesn't even know what it's supposed to look like, but he wants me to find it. Outrageous, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Could it be...? I suppose I could ask Freed next time I see him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Calm now. Calm and...sleepy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wait, hey! Don't curl up to sleep here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Glizzy is my pillow. It's been decided. G'night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Did you really just go to sleep?! Oh, please, no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>So she trusts me, huh? But if she could see these hands the way I do... I'm the exact opposite of what she thinks of me.</td>
