<td>Let's just say they met a swift end.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The...s-sky we chased after...for so long i-is...fading, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>My soul...will n-never stop...following you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're the only one left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Even you cannot defeat us all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We'll stop you before you do something that can't be undone. That's the least I can do for someone from my homeland.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What do you mean "before"?! He's already caused so much damage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Let's make him pay for everything he's done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You've brought terror into the lives of the people of Babel and caused substantial harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>As Lord Commander, keeper of the peace in this world, I cannot forgive you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hmph. You don't even have the strength to talk back, do you? There's no point drawing this out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Let's finish this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>As for the Templars' remains...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Vier...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Do you ever dream of the future?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Only of my own death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>At least you're consistent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I haven't set a date yet, but it's in on my to-do list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You're not ready to lay down and die right now, though. Are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Perhaps not. In the end, my destination will be the jaws of the afterlife...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But, for now, there's nowhere in the world I'd rather sleep than here. The beds are just too comfy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We're on the precipice of the final battle, and yet, thanks to you, everybody is sleeping like logs. They'll be well-rested come tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Except for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I can't sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I could get in bed with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That'd be unfair on you. You have to stay awake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I can't sleep, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Come on. Just this once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Let's talk about our dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I didn't mean for that to come out so...cringy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ahahaha! It was cute, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'll take that as a compliment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You should!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You've taught me a lot, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Have I been a good teacher?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>When it comes to giving your students good dreams? You're the best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Tee hee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The Templars' Number Four, Vier, was found dead in Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh! Good morning, Acht. Did you sleep well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The cause of death appears to have been blood loss from severe lacerations. However, as the body was left in the center of the battlefield...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I hope you always have good dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>But, well, don't worry. You can count on me to give them to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It had been trampled and battered beyond recognition. Were it not for some eyewitness accounts we collected at the scene, we would not have been able to identify the corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Füry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Just let me do it alone. No one needs to fight but me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It's conceited to think you can defeat a whole country by yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I don't care whether I make it back or not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It doesn't matter if I fall! So long as the damage caused by we who have been persecuted will leave its mark on history... So long as some light will remain in Lost Blue, faint though it may be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I could ask for nothing more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's all up to you. Give them the fight of your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Somehow, even that line sounds like a curse coming from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>In a sense, it is. It's my mournful wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>To think we'd join forces with Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Why not? We all know how this is gonna end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>With their deaths?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Hehehehe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Ikasa was the one responsible for that prayer, wasn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>So you knew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It'd be nice if you could watch over her for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What if she doesn't break?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Good point. I think...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I think she'll end up putting a spell on the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>So, let me get this straight. Your magic rites allow you to use your experiences to manifest things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Yes, that's correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Good. Then the time we spent here won't be for nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The little taste of peace we've had here might just come in handy someday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You want me to use these happy experiences as fuel for my rites?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You can, right? Or is that a little too optimistic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I'm glad you're our sun. That you're the one watching over us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Perhaps, one day, even these gloomy days of rain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Will feel like they had a purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Acht... I really hope you survive this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The Templars' Number Five, Füry, was found dead by Northern Pride's castle gate before the decisive battle had begun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>No matter what happens, you shouldn't blame yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Her body was given a modest burial by the Paladins who discovered her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Sieba...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>If one of my blades is stopped, I've gotta immediately strike with the other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Because I fight with my heart and everything else on the line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>And you don't want any help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Not until the battle is decided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Just remember: I don't know what Yauras looks like. And I'll be marching with Greed Dike, so I might not be able to catch up with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Whatever. Just stay out of my way, unless you want a punch in the guts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You're starting to sound like Neun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I'm starting to sound like him? More like he's starting to sound like me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>If that's the case, try to be a better influence on him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Why don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>He doesn't listen to me any more than you do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Heh. I don't bow down to anyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>There's no denying that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Our life down here has no meaning, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I want to change that, even just for a moment, before I wink out of existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I have to win at life at least once, or I'll never rest in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>But even if I lose in the end...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I want "us" to win. Together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I am the soldier who encompasses the best of both magic and might.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>And I'm the greatest dual-wielding swordswoman in the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Together, we can turn this world on its head!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Let's seize ourselves a real victory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>And dazzle the world while we're at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>The Templars' Number Seven, Sieba, met her end in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>We have confirmed that it was Yauras who killed her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Hehe. You've got some gorgeous equipment there, Acht.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Don't you ever forget to polish it up, okay? And don't let anyone hold you back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>We have yet to recover Sieba's body. Saga is a huge area, and the exact whereabouts of her final stand were muddled by the chaos of battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Zehn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Is this...for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>You're giving me a ball, Acht?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Well, I noticed that the one that you're always carrying around is covered in blood, and falling apart at the seams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>What! Wh-when did you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>You were adamant about not joining the Templars, so when you finally did I worried we'd forced you into it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>You have nothing to feel bad about. It was only because of...a family matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Still...I wanted to express my gratitude in some way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I remembered how happy I was when Sol gave me a gift, and I thought...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>You mean that shabby-looking eyepatch of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Hehe. Guess we've got something in common.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>We need to take better care of our things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Well...anyway... That's why I asked Füry to help me make a ball for you. I thought it should be hand-woven, to match the one you hold so dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I-it's my first time making something like this, so it's a little misshapen, and it doesn't bounce all that well, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>It's a ball filled with warmth and charm. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>You mean it? Then...would you like to play together sometime? After the battle, I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>W-we don't have to play ball! It could be a boardgame from Wadatsumi! I've never played before, but I should be able to get the hang of that one with all the little black and white pieces...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Acht...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>And I was thinking maybe you could teach me how to use a katana, too! What's that thing you can do? Iai? I should master something like that. I rely on my weapons too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Acht...I don't think—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>And, I mean, you've been with us for a very long time. You climbed Veda with Sol even before you became a Templar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Acht?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I know you've been with us from the beginning, from way before you became Number Ten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>So...you're very important to all of us. I'm sure of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>You're like...a father. To all of us Templars!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>I... I just want you to remember that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>I appreciate that, Acht. More than I can say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>The Templars' Number Ten, Zehn, died during the final battle in Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I feel like I might just become whole again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>I could lose everything, and I would never forget those words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>After facing off against half a dozen of our regiment captains, he ended his own life by committing ritual seppuku.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Neun...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Well, you know more about fear than I could ever come to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Fear of losing your place in this world, fear of losing at all… And the fear of growing so strong, you become numb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>That's why I want you to walk with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>I will kill those who hurt my friends by any means necessary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Heh! The Templars' code for the Unforgivable! That's my favorite of all our commandments!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>It just speaks to me, y'know? I feel it in my core. In my heart. In my muscles. Know what I mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>You were the one who created that commandment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>It only makes sense that it resonates with you so strongly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>I don't remember doing that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>What? You mockin' me or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>No, but since I know how forgetful you can be, I just wanted to remind you about someone before the final battle begins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>About a girl you once knew, who puked up nine beers' worth of blood for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>You might not remember her, but she's still alive among us Templars. I don't want her to be forgotten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>The girl who became your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>The more you run your mouth, the less I have any idea what you're tryin' to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I figured you'd say something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Who cares about the past? And what does some girl who won't even be bashin' heads with us have to do with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Feh. Bet she's just some coward who ran away at the first sign of trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>You're wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>You're still together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>What d'you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>A-and why... *Sniff* Why can't I stop cryin'?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>G-guess I must have...somethin' in my eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>You're crying because you can feel her here. She's right here with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>*Sniff*... Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>So she was...strong, then? Real strong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Incredibly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>At least as strong as you are now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Please don't cry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Heh... Good to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>You're stronger than this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Thanks for the reminder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Stronger than you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Now, let's get this show on the road! I couldn't be more ready. Let 'em come! The bigger they are, the harder they fall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>And no one's stronger than us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>The Templars' Number Nine, Neun, also died during the decisive battle in Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Acht! You'd better keep yourself in good shape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Don't overdo it! Conserve your strength! We've got a long road ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>His body was frozen with ice magic, then shattered into so many pieces that their retrieval was deemed impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>I will kill those who harm my friends by any means necessary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Acht...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>("Unforgivable.")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>The dark wind within Sol is getting stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>But I can fulfill one last promise to you. These bastards who took your lives...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>I will slaughter every single one of them!</td>
</tr>
