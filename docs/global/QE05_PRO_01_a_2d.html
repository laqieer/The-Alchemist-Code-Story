<td>Haaa... Haaa... There it is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Insolent girl! How dare you defy the authority of Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Your blasphemy is unforgivable! You have earned the wrath of the great Sun King!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Blasphemy?! How dare you! I know the truth, I have seen through your lies! None of you have any right to proclaim righteousness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The truth, you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Who—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What a peculiar thing to say. I, Zechs, would be very grateful if you might elaborate on what you mean by that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You...! Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Urgh! I-it's just a dust cloud. Push through! Don't let her escape! Kill her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I have to hurry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Now, now. Don't be so brash. If you kill her, we won't find out who leaked information about the Mikaboshi to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>How could you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Besides, I'm still curious about what she meant by..."truth." Don't worry, girl. You won't die until you've told us everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tsk, tsk. Why waste all of our time? It's pointless to resist. Remember, you don't need legs to talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Beast Art Evocations! Book Two, Tigris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Attacking with creatures summoned from drawn images... I never expected to see such an interesting skill. Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This is child's play compared to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>She allowed herself to be swallowed whole?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No! She intends to escape beyond our walls! After her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Haa...haa... Thank you, Orochi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I must...hurry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm impressed. You managed to steal the Mikaboshi from right under the noses of all those Greed Dike soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Really, how short-sighted can you be? Did you think it would be that easy to make it out of here alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Edgar L. Leonhart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Your end game leaves a lot to be desired. It's like you're not even trying to escape death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Edgar?! Don't tell me you've become loyal to the Sun King!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Loyal to...? Don't be ridiculous! I'm the only one who decides when to pull the trigger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Then...you always planned to—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You just couldn't lie low, could you?! Go to hell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Again...? Why must our noble will be defied yet again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Nevertheless, this sorrow...will not be forgotten. It will be passed down through generations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Even if this life is to come to an end...the flames of this soul will...never...die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>One month ago. Slothstein, Redington City.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ughhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What is up with this flowerpot?! Haa... Haa... I-it's way...too...heavy! Is this thing packed with lead or something?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This was your idea, kid. You giving up already? I did say that you should let the Alkaroid take care of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Bzz... Please rest. Allow me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Look at that. This thing was almost scrapped, and it's still working harder than you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That Ethan character is an impressive one, isn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>This thing was all messed up, and still he managed to put it back together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Bzz... Sweet tea, ready to be served... Please rest...bzz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>As if! Miss Fiona planted these herself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>They represent the light returning to Slothstein! I want to carry these with my own two hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hey, she's now the mayor of Redington. I think you ought to be calling her "Mayor Elester" now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Shut up! I don't care how much of a big-wig she becomes! She'll always be—huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What's up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Uh, well, I thought I just saw Edgar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Huh... We only have three days until the Reconstruction Festival. If you're gonna slow things down like this, I'll put you back on house-sitting. Now, let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Bzz...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>W-wait for me, Tango! Ugh! I forgot this was heavy... Tango!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>The Reconstruction Festival...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I've been told a massive tremor nearly flattened this place, but...I never expected it to be so quickly rebuilt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The meeting is over! The final rehearsal for the parade will start as soon the mayor arrives! Hurry, get the children!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>The children? They've already gone to their choir practice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It must be the liveliness of these people that made it possible to recover in such a short time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Without the zeal and enthusiasm of these people, this place would still be in ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What a lovely sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Here she comes! The mayor's here! Hurry! Someone get the children!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Is the source of that information reliable?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yes. A merchant who returned from Saga this morning confirmed it. He said he saw it with his own eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What shall we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Well, we must prioritize verifying the truth of the matter. Please organize a special envoy immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Immediate assistance may become necessary. We should be prepared to provide support just in case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Man, it's as if I'm looking through a kaleidoscope. I take my eyes off of you for a second and you transform from a little girl into a grown woman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>If I could, I'd ask for time to pass more slowly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You're flashing through life with such speed and brilliance, I just might go blind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ed...gar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Long time no see, little lady. Oh, shoot, I'm sorry. I guess it would now be discourteous of me to call you that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Edgar! Wh-when did you get back?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Oh, who knows. You'd have to ask the goddess of fate herself for details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I'd say about three days ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Uh... How did you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>We've received payment invoices from several taverns. They said a blond gunman told them to send the bill to the Elester family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Drinks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Well, uh, you see... I thought I'd get to... Last time I had some expenses and... I didn't drink that much, okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>To tell you the truth, I got into a little trouble in Northern Pride, so I came here to recuperate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>After all that, I'm feeling a little too delicate for any heavy drinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Recuperate?! Are you unwell?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Yeah, but it's not that serious. Don't worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I feel like the water here really suits me. I healed up in the blink of an eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>That's a relief, but please don't push yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>He's lying, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Hey, Alkemono! I'm surprised you can speak so well now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Don't let him fool you! There are rumors that he's been chasing girls around town! He hasn't been resting at all, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Well, never mind. Looks like he's still bugging out. We should take him in for repairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Seriously...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Anyway, is there something going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>You looked sort of gloomy, and those lackeys of yours ran off pretty frantically. What's happening here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Well...uhm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Ah, you don't have to tell me if you can't. I'm sure there is a lot of stuff you are not allowed to disclose as the mayor of this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I don't believe it would be a problem to tell you. There is a rumor that a dragon has appeared somewhere in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>We've received several reports of people seeing a giant dragon in the Saga region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>To avoid causing a panic, we have not made this information public, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Wait, wait, wait... When you say dragon, you mean wings and fire breath and everything?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>We're not sure about fire breath, but I've just sent a special envoy to Saga to verify the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>So...if you could...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Yeah, don't worry. People will panic if they hear about this. I'll keep it to myself. Now, aren't you busy? Go on, get outta here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>B-but you've gone to the trouble to come see us... Oh, I know! Will you stay for the Reconstruction Festival? It's in just in three days!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Yeah, I'll think about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>A giant dragon, huh? I wonder if the Sacred Stones are involved?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I better keep this in mind. And...? What do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>A blond gunman... You're Edgar L. Leonhart, are you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>What are you wearing, a costume? Is that a katana?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Yes, it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>That's dangerous, you know. You shouldn't bring a thing like that along when asking for a date.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>A d-d-date?! Wh-what are you...? Ridiculous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Whoa! Don't get so worked up, it was just a joke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Tch! Edgar L. Leonhart! I have some questions for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Some questions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>It's about the red-haired man from Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I also need to know about a place called Lost Blue that is said to be here in Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>What do you want with that kind of information?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>That is none of your business. Either you answer me or I beat it out of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Beat it out of me? At least take me out to dinner first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Dinner...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Dinner?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>You pervert!!!</td>
