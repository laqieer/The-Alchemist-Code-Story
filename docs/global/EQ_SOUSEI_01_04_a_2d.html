<td>That blue blade... You forged it using Sephirium, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It is a difficult material to work with, especially to craft arms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yet it is harder than any metal. One would never guess that it is plant resin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A Sephirium blade... Never thought I'd live to see the day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That I was able to obtain such a rare material gives my presence in this land meaning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well, that's good to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tell me why you have blown into my workshop today, little zephyr.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I've brought a friend with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>A friend? I never even wanted your company to begin with... Must I have two nuisances with whom to contend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So this is the smithy, huh? It kinda reminds me of my workshop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This lad hails from the Acedia Belt Region.</td>

<td>What is your Engineer Soldier made from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yna... You've heard of it before? The Engineer Soldier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I saw you fighting it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Now tell me what it's made from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The base is mainly red metal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Red metal, hm? Gleigstene would be better. It's lighter and stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What the hell is that? Clay...gusten...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If you don't have access to that, Glinium should work just as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It's a little weightier than Gleigstene, but no less sturdy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That won't work, either. Can't do much mining in the Acedia Belt Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Actually, wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What about Biligiustene? It's pretty much identical to Glinium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It is too hard. It would be difficult to work with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No worries there. Back home, we've got the technology to refine it, no problems. We use it in place of Glinium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Truly? In that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Biligiustene, huh? It's so commonplace, I just wasn't seeing it. I might try that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What is it, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It's just as I thought. You two get along swimmingly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I didn't think we'd end up talking shop right off the bat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I am a blacksmith. Machines are not my area of expertise, but I do know my materials.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I merely expressed my opinion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Come to think of it, the Engineer Soldier could use a weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What do you say? Will you forge something for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I forge arms for people. I am a blacksmith, not a weapons dealer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What's the difference?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It's his pride as a craftsman. I get that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Blacksmiths and weapons dealers are completely different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Told ya. The spirit of a craftsman is a stubborn one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hey, can I have a look at that sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>This? This is my blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yeah, that one! I don't know anything about blacksmiths and their swords, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Even I can tell that that blade is one of a kind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>This sword...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Is a fragment of my very soul. I never felt that way about a blade until I held this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>In other words, it's your masterpiece!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>No. It is not that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Huh? Do you have a better sword stashed away somewhere, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Nor is that the case. I do not believe in the word "perfection."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>There is no such thing as a masterpiece.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You know what? I like that attitude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>And damn, it's contagious! Now I'm itching to hole up in the workshop on my airship and start improving my Engineer Soldier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Not to put a damper on your enthusiasm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Ugh! What is it, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I was hoping you wouldn't mind telling us more about the other belt regions you've been to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Again? Jeez, Nimul, you really like hearing about them, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Just as the two of you are interested in technology and minerals unknown to you, I want to know more about the world in which we all live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>But I've already told you everything I know, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I've only been to two regions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The Acedia Belt Region, and the Luxuria Belt Region. That's it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>The place where I once lived...was called Avari Village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It is a place shrouded always in dark clouds, where lightning bolts rain down from the sky, night and day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>The trees struck by lightning would catch alight, and their fire would swallow up entire forests, trapping the creatures within in a fiery grave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>This was the punishment that was visited upon that land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>That is no punishment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>The pollution of the earth... Quakes, permafrost, lightning storms... These are not punishments. They are calamities, each and every one of them a terrible misfortune suffered by the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Sure, but aren't these calamities still humankind's punishment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Adaleigh... You mustn't fall into that trap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Trap? What trap?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>You should begin by questioning the so-called "way of the world."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>For the first step in reshaping this world is to take a critical look at the things which supposedly govern it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>H-huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I'm sure you'll figure it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>A critical look, huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Waginau...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>What are you doing here?! The Godwolf Ceremony is today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Not only is it an important day for your sister, but for you as well! Today, you will be ordained as chief of the Sephira Village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I am well aware of that fact, thank you, Waginau. But the ladies-in-waiting should have already taken care of the preparations. There is little for me to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Is there some reason why I should not be here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>You're a damn fool. Now, come with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>H-hey! Quit pulling on me, you maniac!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Hey, I thought this ceremony was to renew the connection between the Vessel and the Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>What does the chief have to do with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Nimul once told me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>That the role of chief is second only to that of the Vessel herself in its importance to the Sephira people. Apparently, this has something to do with the judgment passed by the Godwolf Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Not only that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>But the Godwolf Ceremony is also a festival; a celebration, to be shared by the entire village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>A festival, huh? You gonna go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>While Nimul might frequent my forge, the other villagers are not nearly so fond of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I am an outsider, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Besides, it will be far too noisy for my tastes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>So... You're not gonna go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Well, I must admit, I'm curious. I'm gonna go check it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Come, come! The Godwolf Ceremony is today! Why not warm your belly with a cup of sacred sake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>A wooden mask for the little lad! Or how about you, pretty lady? Come try one on! Don't be shy, now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Just as I thought. There are far too many people here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>So you say, yet here you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>It is a special day for him. I owe him this much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I guess... I probably owe Nimul, too, come to think of it. He's been pretty good to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Anyway, you think we'll actually be able to watch this thing? The ceremony, I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>An altar will be built among Sephiron's roots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>You can watch from afar, certainly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Huh? Waginau?! What're you doing here? What about the ceremony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Me? I am the head of the Sephira Guard. I am here to protect the people in the unlikely event that some accident should occur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Julia and the ladies-in-waiting are the ones who manage this rite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Well, it is almost time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>The ceremony will begin shortly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Please proceed to the altar, Lord Nimul, Lady Emmel. I am afraid that I am unable to follow you past this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Thank you, Julia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>May the ceremony be concluded safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Let's go, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Tree of Life, Sephiron, mother of the Sephira...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>O Guardian Dragon Nidhogg... May your avatar, the Godwolf Asena, come forth into our midst.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>The Godwolf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>What the—?! Look, a wolf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>It is the Godwolf Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>The avatar of Guardian Dragon Nidhogg, the ancient dragon who protects our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>The avatar of an ancient dragon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>The Great Nidhogg resides in the heavens above, and restrains for us the powers of the Cursed Beast sleeping beneath our feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Can't you communicate with the dragon itself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>It is impossibly colossal. Should the Great Nidhogg descend upon us, we would all be sent flying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Well... That doesn't sound good. It can stay up there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Godwolf Asena, as the Vessel of Purification, I beseech you... Bind unto me Sephiron's powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>The land has been ravaged to a more terrible extent than ever before by the Cursed Beasts and their corruption. It is withering, and it is dying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Please, I beg of you... Give me strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>It shall be done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Yes... I can feel it. The great power of the Sephiron... It's warmth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Vessel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Yes, Your Divinity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>With these powers, see thy duty done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Upon my heart...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>O Asena...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>This child of the Sephiron would be the chief of the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Please... We humbly ask for your judgment on—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Godwolf Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>N-Nimul! What're you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>I would ask you this: what is the way of the people of this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Live alongside the corrupted earth; shoulder thy sins, and perish among them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Then pray allow me another question: why must humankind shoulder their sins? Who is it who punishes us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Nimul! What are you doing?! Stop this! The ceremony—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>So long as thou roam these lands, thou cannot escape thy sins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Even as none of thy kind can hope to live without bringing misfortune upon others, so sin and punishment are as fundamental as breath and air.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>For these are the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>The Cursed Beasts are thy sins made manifest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Wh-what...? The Cursed Beasts are...our sins?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>It is so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>The seven sins...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Seven are the sins committed by humankind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Superbia. Ira. Invidia. Gula. Avaritia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Luxuria. Acedia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>There are seven lands in this world in which humankind resides, and each of them is haunted by a beast of sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>The sin of this land is...Gula. And the name of the beast of sin that slumbers beneath our feet...is the Cursed Beast Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Which means that the true name of this land is...the Gula Belt Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>It is as thou say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Godwolf Asena... Can nothing be done about the sins of this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Nimul! Stop...! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>You're going to anger the Godwolf Asena!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Answer me, Godwolf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Speak, Godwolf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Stop it! As the Vessel of Purification who serves Sephiron, I command you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Nimul of the Sephira, you will restrain yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Ngh... Hrrnghh...! My determination cannot be halted so easily!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Wh-what?! I am ordering you to stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Please don't, Emmel. You're the one I'm trying to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Yes?! I'm the one you're trying to...what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Graaaarrrrrgghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>No! I can't believe it... You resisted my powers, the powers of the Vessel, of Sephiron...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Sorry, Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>Godwolf Asena! How can we free ourselves from sin?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Who art thou?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Ngh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>My name is Nimul, and I am to be the chief of the Sephira people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>I sense within thou a tremendous strength of will...and a small, yet brilliant, power... Thine might.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>Distinct from the magics of the great tree... A power set to turn this world on its end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>What wilt thou do with these powers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
