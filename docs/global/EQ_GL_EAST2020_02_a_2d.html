<td>Hey there, what's the commotion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ah! Didn't you hear? School's closed since there's a dangerous beast in there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(This day is becoming wackier by the minute...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Stop! The school is closed until further notice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, is that you Soren? It's been awhile but you caught us at a bad time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Good to see you again. I heard the news about the beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There are teachers still in there trying to restrain it, but meanwhile this outer barrier should prevent its escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>By any chance, have you seen Minerva? She might be able to help with this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I've been to her place, and let's just say its just a mess of books and chocolate eggs right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Unfortunately no, but we could really use another mage to restrain the beast. Would you mind helping us for now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>At this rate, the Annual Egg Hunt could be cancelled!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You can count on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Nyahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Woah! What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Soren! Are we glad you're here. This beast has been stealing the chocolate eggs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Stealing huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Did you get an identification on it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No... it's much too fast for us, but maybe if we combined our bind spells!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ok, I'm ready on your mark!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We did it! Now we can identify...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huh? This... this is a cloaking spell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>B-but that's a master level spell! How can a beast...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I must get to all the eggs!!! Don't stop me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm sorry! But you're distracting me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The entity brings out a potion and throws it onto the ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>*snarl*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Eep! There are monsters coming from the woods in droves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This beast is an extremely dangerous magic user! Everyone, be careful!</td>
