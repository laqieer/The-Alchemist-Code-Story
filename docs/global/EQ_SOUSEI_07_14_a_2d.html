<td>002</td>
<td>Oh, how perplexing, irrational, and selfish humans are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But for them to be this capable...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Now, all that's left is to deal with this corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>.........</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Lord Kubera?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This is the Cursed Beast's core. It is the source of the power that can maintain or destroy this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wait! The core holds all the region's sin within it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If you keep touching it, you'll...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Let go of it, now! If you don't, you'll fall to the corruption of this region's sins! Or even worse, you'll—</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Become a Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Lord Kubera, you're not thinking of—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Traveler... Your power, your fighting style, and the reasoning behind it... All of this was unheard of to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But the thing that surprised me the most was your ability to wield the power of a Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You use...Alchemy, was it? It is truly a new technique, capable of changing the world and the meaning of strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I have yet to experience just how strong it is myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You would gamble your life just to test Nimul's strength, Lord Kubera?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>As I have said before, we are willing to sacrifice everything if even one of us can obtain the ultimate power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The seat of ultimate power! An unparalleled dream! The one closest to it...is you, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So how can I not test it? Why must I sheathe my blade without a fight?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>A duel I have bet my life—bet everything on. Will you not accept, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I've decided to accept all sins. Not just my own, but the ones you bear as well, Lord Kubera.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You have my thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Now then, shall we begin to determine which of us should be called a god of war and lord their power over others?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This will be the end of your fruitless struggling!</td>
