<td>What a troublesome day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Is that the ore?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hey! Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What?! Seriously... She's burning with a fever. This is what happens when some nobleman's daughter does something she's not used to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...O-ohh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You're awake. I'll use the ore you gathered to forge a blade, so you wait here. All things considered, I have some confidence when it comes to welding metal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What are you doing?! Please, stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Whoaaa! Careful! What's gotten into you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Please don't do anything to turn my brother's ore into one of these self-glorified glittering weapons you have lined out here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Are you saying that the weapons I make are self-glorifications?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Because it belonged to someone I love, I allowed it to remain by his side all this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But I don't want my brother to wield a weapon created by someone who's become overpompous due to his title of the Ultimate Blacksmith!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Are you saying that I'm overpompous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I only sell to those whose abilities I've recognized, "My standards for making a sale are based on an individual's beliefs"... If those words are not overpompous...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...Then what on earth is? Many of the remarks you have uttered today seem to portray a man with delusions of his own greatness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(I...I thought I hated the name the Ultimate Blacksmith, but it appears that somewhere along the way I'd come to accept it!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So, would you please hand me the remaining ore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I want a sword that embodies my love for my brother...to attach itself to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Attach itself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes. A sword that will be worthy of my brother...is one that ceaselessly serves only him and cuts everything he desires it to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>A weapon filled with love and fidelity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I thought the Ultimate Blade that you were attempting to make was something more...pure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Who are you creating your blades...your weapons for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Are you saying that...you remember me, Reida?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well now, I'm not sure what you're talking about, Beardo♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(Ultimately, I was the one who was being swayed by my title. A weapon needs a wielder; it exists to serve and love its owner.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Are you still going to adhere to names and titles?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hey... Reida, would you let me assist you in making your sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I think I can be of some use...well, I'm not even sure about that, but I'd like to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Heheh. If that's the case...then I'll permit it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I owe you one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's finished. My brother's Ultimate Blade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hya-hahah! So that's where the Ultimate Blade was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Just so you know, this is my brother's, so I'm not giving it to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I gotcha. That's the Ultimate Blade specifically for Reido.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's a far superior blade to the one he has now. I can guarantee that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I don't need you guarantee, Beardo. Mine will suffice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hahah. Did I get ahead of myself again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Heheh. Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Heh. When you get to be my age, it becomes harder to cut down one's deeply rooted arrogance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm sure you'll be fine, Eizan—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Just call me Beardo... I prefer that name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Beardo, I'm sure you'll be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>One day, I'll make an Ultimate Sword just for me and I'll show it off to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It'll be nice if you could spend your lifetime together with that weapon, Beardo♪ Well then...goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hey, Reida...did you show up for your own sake...or...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>For mine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Of course...I showed up for my brother's sake♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hahaha. Well, you've managed to "bend" my beliefs and my pride. Well then! Time to start again from scratch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That being said...I'm kinda liking it.</td>
