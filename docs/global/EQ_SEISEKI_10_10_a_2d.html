<td>Seidaaaa!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I need you to tell me the whereabouts of the Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I went easy on you. I didn't go too far, did I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ug...gff!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Seida...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Sorry... That hurts, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>However, this is the long-cherished wish of the oppressed people of Lost Blue. You'll forgive me, won't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...Ugh...ghh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So, you've stored it safely in your chest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I would prefer not to touch a lady's body without her consent. How about you obediently hand it over?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...Ugh...! Twin Fang God Wolf!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Whoops! Sorry, but that attack won't work on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Come now. Hand over the Matter. I don't want to kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ju...just so you know...I would never engage in something so efficient as...a desperate, senseless attack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Seida!</td>

<td>028</td>
<td>Hey...give that to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...! N-no way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...Right. Killing your comrades isn't enough to deter your resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>In that case, there's no point in killing Seida. If so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The...the settlement! Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>In that case...I'll burn Saga region to the ground without leaving a trace.</td>

<td>Just so you know, this isn't a threat. I have nothing to regret losing in this continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ka-Kagura...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes. I'll promise you that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's not like I want to destroy all of this. You understand that, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ka...Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>As long as we don't lose half of this world's Sacred Stones, there's still a chance we can save it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm sure that Kanon will defend and protect Northern Pride's Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>?! Kagura...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...I'm sorry, Seida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I cannot bear this region of Saga to become the second Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
