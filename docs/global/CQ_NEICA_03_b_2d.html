<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wh-what are you saying?! You can barely stand. You should really—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I can't! I will bring home the Scroll of Success no matter what! Just...like I promised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The Scroll of Success?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>N-no way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>There are rumors that my calligraphy has special powers—that it can work like a protective charm. Is that what you're after, mister?</td>

<td>My daughter has a big exam comin' up soon.</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well... That's up to your daughter. If she works hard—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>She is workin' hard! She's workin' more than hard enough! If she can just show her ability on the day, she'll pass, guaranteed! But she gets all nervous when it comes to the real thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>All I can do is support her...by gettin' her a charm to help her out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But your accessories are crazy expensive... I can't afford 'em to save me life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So you decided to kidnap her and make her write something for you? Don't you think that's selfish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Unnnghh... I know, but...</td>

<td>Th-thanks! Thanks so much, Miss Fujika!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wow... You're amazing, Fujika! I can't believe you gave away your calligraphy like it was nothing. I'm not sure I could do something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It wasn't nothing. I pour my heart and soul, and even a bit of my mana, into every single one I do. Giving them away is part of the joy I get from making them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Anyway, you're the one who's amazing, Neica! Look over there!</td>

<td>Look at this stall! Oh my gosh, you can buy accessories made by Neica! Wow! There are so many!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This one is super cute! It would look so good on you! You should put it on and go ask out that cutie you have your eyes on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>H-huh?! N-no way! I can't do that! I'm not confident enough...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's exactly why you need to buy one of these accessories! They'll fill you up with Neica Power! Come on, give it a try!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>A-all right. Mmm... Y-yeah! I guess I do feel kinda pumped. All right! I'll... I'll do it! I'll give it my best shot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Neica Power? Wh-what are they talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Your accessories are totally cute, and they give you power! That's really amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Th-they're really not that special...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>They are special!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That girl got the confidence she needed to go and express her feelings, thanks to your accessory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's what your power is, Neica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>M-my...power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(I always felt like having these powers was an inconvenience. I never wanted them, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Those girls looked so happy.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I really wanted to come and see your accessories today, Neica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I mean, your letters are always, like, so cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>All the little touches, like the bits of gold leaf, are so fantastic! Every time I open one of your letters, I'm always so excited! They really make me feel good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I just knew your accessories had to be super cute, too! I couldn't stop thinking about them, so I had to come and see them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Y-you did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I mean, I just adore you, Neica, and I like everything you make so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>When you put your heart into something, Neica, it actually gives it power, and that power can make people happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>And seeing my friend's work bring smiles to people's faces makes me so happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(So...my powers can make people happy.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(I never thought of that before.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Thanks, Fujika.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I feel just like I do when I'm reading one of your letters—no, it's even better in person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Maybe it has something to do with your powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Heehee. Maybe! I guess that makes us twins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Twins? Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oh! I should make us some matching accessories, so that we have something to remember today by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Oh my gosh! I can't wait! Make sure you show them to me next time we meet, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Well, they'll be like a memento between the two of us, so...if you like, I can send yours when they're done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
