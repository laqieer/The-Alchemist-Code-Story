<td>Zweite Aqua Shot!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Urgh... There's too many of them! I can't take care of this alone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Chomp, chomp, chomp...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Haaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I've never seen such monsters before. Are they also here due to the disasters of the other world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We'll have time to think about that later. We need to get rid of them first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You've got a point. Ugh. Why can't life just be easy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>W-wow... They took down all of those Balloons in an instant...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Th-thank you so much for your help! My name is Melty Melromarc. May I ask who you all are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm Anastasia. We received an order to eradicate the monsters that suddenly appeared here from another world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm Ryle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My name's Lamia. What strange creatures they were... They kept trying to bite us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Strange creatures? Do you mean the Balloons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>They're pretty common here in Melromarc...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Where's this Melromarc you speak of? We're in Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Continent of Babel... Does this mean that I'm in another world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I suppose so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I never thought that I'd end up being the one summoned to another world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>D-do you happen to know if anyone else has been sent here besides me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There have been others who called themselves Those Bonded With the Waves, but I don't have much information besides that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But you wouldn't have been called to this world if you weren't needed for something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Needed...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Our turn for questions. What is all this about Waves? I know it's about an otherworldly calamity or something, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Waves are terrifying calamities that occur when powerful monsters slip out of dimensional rifts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Once a Wave occurs, the monsters will spill endlessly out of the rift until the wave is suppressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>"Endlessly"? I don't like the sound of that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes. We must defeat the monsters' boss with the help of the heroes who wield the Four Holy Weapons: the Sword Hero, Spear Hero, Bow Hero, and Shield Hero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's all I know about Waves. I'm not sure if they're different here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Sword, spear, bow... It sounds like the gear types that we use. We don't have a shield, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You're right... You're using the same types of weapons as the four heroes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I wouldn't call us "heroes", though. We're nothing but boring old Phantom Soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Phantom Soldiers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Phantom Soldiers are those from other eras who are summoned by alchemists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Does that mean you're all...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The less you know, the better...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>O-okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(I guess I shouldn't have pressed them on that... I have no clue what's going on.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ah! Watch out, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Th-there's more, already?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>My goodness... Where'd these guys pop out from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Gahgahgah!</td>
</tr>
