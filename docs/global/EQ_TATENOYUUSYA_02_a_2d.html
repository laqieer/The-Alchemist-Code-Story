</tr>
<tr>
<td>Melty Q Melromarc</td>
<td>Waves are terrifying calamities that occur when powerful monsters slip out of dimensional rifts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Melty Q Melromarc</td>
<td>Once a Wave occurs, the monsters will spill endlessly out of the rift until the wave is suppressed.</td>

<td>"Endlessly"? I don't like the sound of that...</td>

<td>Yes. We must defeat the monsters' boss with the help of the heroes who wield the Four Holy Weapons: the Sword Hero, Spear Hero, Bow Hero, and Shield Hero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Melty Q Melromarc</td>
<td>That's all I know about Waves. I'm not sure if they're different here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lami.png" alt="Lamia" height="128"><br>Lamia</td>
<td>Sword, spear, bow... It sounds like the gear types that we use. We don't have a shield, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Melty Q Melromarc</td>
<td>You're right... You're using the same types of weapons as the four heroes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>I wouldn't call us "heroes", though. We're nothing but boring old Phantom Soldiers.</td>

<td>Phantom Soldiers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/anas.png" alt="Anastasia" height="128"><br>Anastasia</td>
