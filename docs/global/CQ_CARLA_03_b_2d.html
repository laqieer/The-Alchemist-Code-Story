<td>Oof!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Phew…looks like we won! Thanks, Miss Carla.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>"Looks like?" You were pretty impressive back there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You think so? I only kicked half as much butt as you…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Still, you pick up a thing or two when you've worked as long as I have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You don't say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ugh….N-No way! We hired those guys from the mercenary guild!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Damn… They proved totally useless when we needed them the most.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You'll regret this! The guild gives us access to very powerful people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Relying on connections to clean up your failures? You people are truly pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sh-Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What's going on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Perfect timing, sir! You see, these hooligans…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, if it isn't Aruba! I've been expecting you. Did you bring the tea I sent for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Of course! A merchant's word is his honor. Here you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That fragrance is unmistakable! I could drink it up this very instant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I can't thank you enough. Whenever I entertain guests, they rave about this tea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's why I pulled some strings to get you membership into the guild.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wha-! You can't be serious! An outsider like him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Of course. It's all been settled. I say it's time we breathe some new life into our local economy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Tch…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Looks like he was interested in your wares, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm grateful for your reliable service, Aruba. The desert market is better off now thanks to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm...shocked! Who'd have thought things would turn out so well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It was a long road, but I finally delivered the tea. And now I'm a guild member!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Normally outsiders aren't allowed to join, but my persistence paid off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's why I came here, even though I didn't make much profit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I was "planting a seed!" First, I had to show them how amazing my wares are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And now you can enjoy the fruits of your labor, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>For anybody else, it would be a daunting task, but that's what makes you a good merchant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Both of you have a knack for stick-to-itiveness. I admire that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Once you realize these sands are alive, you begin to wonder, "Isn't there more I can do?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If we try, we can bring back greenery to this land so that it will become fertile again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That's my plan, anyhow. See? The sand is already starting to feel different, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's not about immediate gains for you two. It's about the long haul... How inspiring!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's it! I've made up my mind! I'm going to follow your lead and start something of my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh? Wonderful! And what might that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well, being with you made me realize I can't just focus on the here and now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'll never grow that way and might wind up like those jerks from before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I may not know much, but if I keep the desert safe, I know it will be a more welcoming place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And merchants like you will be able to travel freely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Unlike you and Hawk, I may not know exactly which "seed" to sow…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But I won't give up until I find what works best for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You better not give up either, kid! I'm looking forward to seeing your face a lot more around here!</td>
</tr>
