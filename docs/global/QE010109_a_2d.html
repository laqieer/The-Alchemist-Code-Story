<td>Hmm. The darkness seems to be eroding your right arm. It looks incredibly painful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ack... It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There is one way to suppress the pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What? How...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's simple; take complete control of the darkness that is causing the pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Control the darkness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Because of your hesitation, you are still being swayed by the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hesitation? That's absurd. I have no hesitation! I've sworn to use this power to change the world!</td>

<td>I see... In that case, will you be able to cut down the man you call your father?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>

<td>In order to change the world, a considerable price must be paid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Do you think you can change it while you're still afraid of losing what's important to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That fear is your weaknessâ€”the source of your pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...!</td>
