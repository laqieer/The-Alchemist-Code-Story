<td>...Captain, are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Silence! I'm thinking right now! Don't speak to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Aye aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(Why did I lose to a muscle head like him...I don't understand.)</td>

<td>Captain! Sunken ship detected on our starboard front! It looks like it's been there for a while!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What? Aye, men, commence investigations immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Captain! There's a cave in the location that it's been stranded! There's air inside...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Maybe the sunken ship was aiming for this cave? I wonder if there's treasure...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>All right. Let's head to the cave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Captain! We've found treasure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Look! There are good-sized treasure boxes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There's antique jewelry...and gold...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hm? Look at this... Is this the strange cloth that muscle head was wearing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What's with this warmth...and enveloping light?!</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Whoooaaa!!!</td>

<td>A certain resort site located near the south-east of Greed Dike where appearances of monsters have been reported.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The resort site has had trouble coping with them and now provides security from the successful Phantoms of the year before in order to ensure security.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Phew! Security is a surprisingly easy job!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Last year was pretty tough though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Last year, it wasn't really the monsters who were tough, you know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...I agree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Those really troublesome pirates showed up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Pirates...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah, but, the loincloth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Rin, you don't have to remember it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ahahah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'll make you all wear loincloths! Gahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You're gonna wear a red one! And you're gonna wear a brown one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ahahah. They're being forced to wear loincloths!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Stop! Stop making everyone wear loincloths!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ack! I thought I was able to avoid it last year, but I didn't expect Gormalas to come back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>On top of that, the already annoying fellow has gotten even more heinous...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But why did he go berserk in that outfit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Th-that's a loincloth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Rin, don't look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Loin...cloth...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Mielikki, you can't look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Whoaaa, that's quite the body!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Is he acting a little strange? Was he always like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>At any rate, he wasn't the type to go around wearing a loincloth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I wonder if the loincloth is suspicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Grrrrrrow!!! You guys put on loincloths too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Eek, he's coming this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You filthy man...everyone stand back!</td>
