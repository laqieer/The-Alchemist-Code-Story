<td>001</td>
<td>It's been a while since the three of us have met together in person...Tehre, Fuu. What's with the serious faces? Come now. We're here to talk about Saga's future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...I'm well aware of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There's something I must speak to you about...no...not just to you, but to all the people of Saga. It is the truth about Alia's death!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Right then. Let us commence the Sprite Trio Discourse, beginning with this matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wow...look at all these people! When everyone gathers together like this, you realize just how many people there are living in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's pretty much a country after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's difficult to realize when we're divided into tribes, but...this kind of gathering really wakes you up to the fact!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes. It is our job to protect the future of these people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Everyone is listening intently to the Sprite Trio speak...but, they're talking all the way from the distant Wind Temple... How can we hear their voices so well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The Wind Temple is said to be the place where wind from across the world gathers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Combining the location with the power of the wind, it shouldn't be much of task to create a magnifying effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wow... Who knew there was such a way to use one's power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We still have a lot to learn. We have to discover exactly what it is that we must do. Tehre is right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Don't get so downhearted, Tina! It's all thanks to you two that the Sprite Trio Discourse became a reality!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Isn't that right, Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...Yes. Lisbeth is right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We must gain more power...and find a way to restore the Wind Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>However, we managed to succeed in making the Sprite Trio Discourse happen. We should be proud of that, Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Exactly! Look how attentively the people of Saga are listening to the discussion. I'm sure it'll work out well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...Yes, you're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well then, let's summarize the discourse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Going forward, we will move beyond factions, and allow all tribes to travel around as they please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>In order to rid ourselves of the Gluttony army...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The Tehre faction will break off ties with Gluttony and will work together with the Voda and Fuu factions to form a Saga coalition force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Having reached a consensus regarding the aforementioned terms, all of Saga will unite against the crisis that we now face. Do you agree to this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...I am not completely satisfied with what you've said, Fuu. However, it is in our best interest to work together. I accept.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I don't expect to convince you right away. With time, I wish to slowly make you understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>People of Saga, it is as we have now proclaimed. Let all of Saga unite together and overcome this crisis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...Right. That's if we can overcome it at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What do you mean, Tehre boy? Isn't that what we just talked about? The key lies in the restoration of the Wind Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>All that's left is to find a path that will lead to its resurrection. Isn't that correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Correct indeed. I have already laid out a plan to achieve this. It relies on killing Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What...are you talking about?! How can you say that is the path to restoring the Wind Matter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You'll see when the results come in. There is no deceit to what we have decided here at the Sprite Trio Discourse. Now is the time for all of Saga to unite...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...And who of Saga do you suggest will carry out something so outrageous as the assassination of Asena? You're being absurd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You're right. Even I couldn't do something so outrageous... That's why I've left it in the hands of someone worthy of the task.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Gluttony Foss' Georgios, the Flame-Armed General!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Tina...Mocca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Argh! Who would've thought our premonition would take shape in the worst way possible?! So, the Sprite Trio Discourse was nothing more than a way to blindside us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>In any case, we need to hurry to Asena! Before it's too late...! We can't allow this to happen!</td>
</tr>
