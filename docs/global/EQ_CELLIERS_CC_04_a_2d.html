<td>According to the results, you're in grave danger right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You turned the flower and vase in your room into crystal without thinking, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Your crystallization ability is a power that solidifies the flow of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>All things cease to function when they lose that flow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>In other words, your power is a threat to all things with Alchemy—everyone around you. And that power is growing remarkably stronger than it used to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Your current power is like a cup filled with water. There's no telling when it'll overflow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I felt it too, you know. That I couldn't control my power the way I want to. I'd never had that problem before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So the control you once had is coming undone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(I heard that his crystallization power was closely linked to his mental state.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(Could that attack have caused Celliers' power to destabilize? I wonder if that's preventing his control...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If I can't control this power of mine...then I can't go back to the village, can I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...Yes. As of now, it would be difficult to get permission for you to reside in the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That being said, I want to do something for you. After all, you've been trying so hard to stand on your own two feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So Michael and I will look for a way to stabilize your power, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's okay. I won't go back to the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I was mistaken... Someone like me, with a power like this, shouldn't live with regular people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I tried to use this power to make my way in this world, but even then, I always relied on Mielikki to make it work...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>And in the end...this power put her in danger, and...caused her sadness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Deep down, I always knew this power...could never make people happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...Is that right? If you ask me, you've made at least one young girl quite happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>When Mielikki gazed at the crystal you gave her, her eyes were filled with happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...Come again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I met with her just recently. I had some business at the adjoining laboratory, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>She was sad that she couldn't see you. And yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I've got to do my best! After all, I have a super special, ultra-important job I just gotta see through to the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And besides, I'll be fine... I've got this, after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This is...a crystal butterfly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yeah! Celliers gave it to me. Looking at this makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Remembering his gentle smile makes everything better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>She really said that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(Mielikki... You still like my crystals?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I, too, think your crystal craftsmanship is something exceptional. Somehow cool and warm in equal measure... Like morning sunlight through the trees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>And what's more... You enjoy your work, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Well, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Anyone could tell the truth from your pieces. Each of your wares are crafted with meticulous care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The fact that you obtained this power through horrendous experiments is indisputable. I can't imagine how awful that past must be for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Despite this, you've made this power into something all your own. You were learning to love that power of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I can empathize somewhat, I think. The work of a Court Mage has no end of hardship, but I'm happy to be of service to others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That's why everyone here is happy to help. Being able to use one's strength as you wish is what it means to live well, and happily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's why I like this job. I hope that you can do the same—that you can use your power to do whatever your heart desires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Flamel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...Why are you being so nice to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You, Michael, everyone here... You all care so much, think so much for someone like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Celliers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Why... Why?! I'm... I'm a monster...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's not true! It'll be okay...after all...Celliers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We became friends, didn't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Mielikki...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(That's right, it was the same back then... Mielikki cared about me more than her own pain.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(Despite the fear, despite the pain, she tried to protect me. That's why I'm here today. And yet...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...How shameful. You all care so much for me, and all I'm doing is thinking of myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I can't keep going on like this. I have to do something, too...for Mielikki's sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Celliers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Flamel. I have an idea I need to run past you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Celliers. Finally showed yourself, have you? I'd heard you'd holed up in the laboratory. It was worth staking out the place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Oh! This sweet scent... Is it that aroma that mesmerizes monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>We weren't up to snuff last we met, but don't think it'll go so well for you this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...I get it. In that case, I'll... I'll just do what I can...!</td>
