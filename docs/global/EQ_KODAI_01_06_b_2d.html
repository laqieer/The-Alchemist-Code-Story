<td>D-did he just manipulate time?! How could a mere human bend the Truth of the world so readily? Truly, an impressive showing!</td>

<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>Too bad it's not enough to counter the might of a dragon!</td>

<td>Tch! The difference in power between us is too much for me to handle!</td>

<td>Fall back! Retreat and regroup!</td>

<td>Pretty quick to turn tail and run, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Hmmm. Between the attempt to ambush and the quick retreat... This isn't how dragons fight. There's a human behind this somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/qens.png" alt="Quence" height="128"><br>Quence</td>
<td>That sounds problematic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>No matter. We drove them away, and that's good enough for now.</td>
</tr>

<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>So, let's take this opportunity to greet and entertain my pupil's very first friend, shall we?</td>
