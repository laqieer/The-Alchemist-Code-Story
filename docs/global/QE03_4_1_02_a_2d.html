<td>Wow...</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Sure, they're just Familiars...but he took them all out with one move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So cool...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Edgar L. Leonhart, who placed Belphegor in your hands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ah, now who was it again? Sorry, but I'm not really good at remembering the name of men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You entered this country to try and "reset" this Sacred Stone, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...Who knows?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Re-reset this Sacred Stone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I didn't know the witches in this country didn't know about it. I heard that it's an ancient magic, so maybe they don't teach it to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ancient magic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We learn ancient magic at school, but we've never heard about "resetting" a Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The ancient witches of this country erased the memories and emotions within Asmodeus in order to remove its curse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>They created a magic that could return it to the same state it was when it was born. They called this magic Arestorus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Arestorus...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Even I've never heard about that magic before. I'm impressed by the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I guess it makes sense that you don't know about it. After all, without any way to reach Asmodeus, this magic must have been buried in history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Arestorus is merely a spell that erases the curse on the Sacred Stone and doesn't reverse its lifespan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But, Edgar...the person who entrusted you with Belphegor, they must have been betting on the potential of that spell...am I correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>How would I know? All I'm doing is keeping a promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>A promise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Arestorus...with that magic the curse of Asmodeus can be removed. If only we can get the Sacred Stone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Edgar! Please! We'll use any means necessary to get above those clouds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm questioning him now. Sorry, you'll have to waitâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>After seeing the desperate look on your faces, girls, there's no way I can turn you down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That being said, when it comes to getting above the clouds...the way...cachou!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh! Edgar, you must be cold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Now you notice?! Of course-,- I'm cold! The witches tore off all my clothes. I just hope they didn't throw them away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Whoa! He just sliced through the iron bars!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>With all the Familiars around here, we won't be able to get much talking done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Let's hurry up and get out of here. As for you, just put something on. You look unsightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I've encountered a lot of extraordinary people recently. Guys who slice through trains and now iron as if they were butter...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>As you can see, I don't have any weapons, so good luck covering for me. See. Here they come already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Familiars again! We cut the iron bars, so now they're even angrier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Please...open a path!</td>
</tr>
