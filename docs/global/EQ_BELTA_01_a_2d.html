<td>I see you’ve recovered. Well? The orchestra isn’t so bad, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I have to agree!<br>And yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Don’t worry about me. I only did what I had to do. And now I’ve come across this great job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I have you to thank for this, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I’m sure you’ll also understand one day. The music will teach you, when that time comes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ah, such a beautiful sound... I wonder who’s playing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh no! It’s almost time for me to meet with Patty and Alaia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>And right about here... I want to set off some cannon fire right when the piece comes to its climax!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>An awesome melody, with a real signal gun. Doesn’t this song make you feel excited?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I love it! So here I’ll change the type of cannon used to add some variety to the sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Nice! I’ll be taking that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hehehe. I’m glad you’re both having fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What?! Aren’t you having fun, Alaia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I love seeing you two enjoy yourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The song ends up being more bright and fun when you two are enjoying yourselves. It seems like this will be another good song. I’m so happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Bertha will fire blank cartridges in time with the music as the Envylia orchestral band plays. It was just a passing idea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I really didn’t expect everyone to like it so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The royal knights enjoyed it, too! Patty’s going to compose a new song! I hope all of the citizens like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What?! Oh no, look at the time! I gotta go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What’s wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Today is the temporary assignment ceremony for the royal knighthood training school! I’ll be toast if I’m late!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The temporary assignment ceremony... The students have finished their practical training and will set off on their own paths</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Is that the kind of traditional event the knights hold? Hang on, Bertie, you’re going to be an instructor?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That’s right. This time I’ll make sure I do my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yeah. I’ve done it a few times before already, but I’m useless. The seniors are always scolding me even during the practical training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, Bertie. I know you don’t like hurting people. Even though they may only be military exercises, don’t you think it’d be difficult to instruct others on how to fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That’s not the only thing. I also wonder to myself, is there anything I can actually teach?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Look, one day you guys will work and fight together side-by-side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I feel odd “teaching” these comrades of mine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That’s why I can’t quite get my head around the whole concept of teaching.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Bertha, you’re just too nice. But I think that’s exactly why you have plenty you can teach the others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Thanks for hearing me out. This time I won’t fail! Oh no, I’m gonna be late! Sorry to leave in the middle of things! We’ll pick up where we left off later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wow. She sure left in a rush. Is she gonna be okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hmm, well, a few people have chosen paths outside of the knighthood. I don’t think that’s a bad thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Not hurting others, huh? That would be the most ideal option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>While I do think the students who chose not to enter the knighthood are happy on their own paths, I think Bertie would be a good instructor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I’m sure it’ll work out for her this time. Oh, but there are a lot of rumors going around about a new student with immense potential...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The therian kid from the Long-Tail Rabbit Clan who is said to be the next big talent since the former vice-captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard, Nina? They say she has the most potential this year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You’re pretty well informed, Patty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Maybe not of the same race, but similar in stance, at least according to the rumors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I hope Bertie doesn't end up in charge of that kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Why do you say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I heard that she’s a little hard to handle. But I guess that can’t be helped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Same Long-Tail Rabbit Clan as Nina, very capable... I’m sure there’s a lot of pressure behind the expectation that she’ll join the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I see. The student seems to have a lot in common with Bertha. There were a lot of expectations for her and her incredible gunnery skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>There are a lot of reasons this kid is drawing attention. I’m a little curious myself. If I remember correctly, her name is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Sorry! I’m late!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You’re late, Bertha! What were you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Sorry! We’re going to play another piece with cannon fire, so I was in a meeting with the orchestral band...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hang on, I’m in charge of this kid?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes, the new student with talents not seen for years. Teach her well. I won’t accept any of your past failures again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The others have already left the castle. You should hurry up yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Eheh, scolded again. I’m Bertha of the Envylia Royal Knighthood artillery regiment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>And you are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...I’m Sharon, a trainee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Little Sharon! Nice to meet you! You can call me Bertie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I’d prefer not to. You’re an instructor, aren’t you? I can’t bring myself to refer to you in such a casual manner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Oh, don’t worry about that. Don’t you think it’s more important that we get to know each other by keeping it casual?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Are you saying that as an instructor? That we should be friendly and not abide by strict hierarchical rules?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Well, not exactly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Good, then. I’m not very good at being friendly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I know of a magnificent person who did all that she could to change how people think about battles... All I want to do is follow and even surpass this person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Well, uhm, uhh...I see! So, little Sharon, you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Don’t call me “little.” Just “Sharon” is fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I don’t believe such nicknames are necessary for training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What?! You don’t even like nicknames?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>My goal is to finish my training and join the Scarlet Flame Guard. I don’t have time for distractions. Let us please get on with this. Time is of the essence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>The Scarlet Flame Guard? Oh! That tail of yours! Are you part of the Long-Tail Rabbit Clan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Oh, I see now. Just like Nina! So that’s why you want to join the Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You’re said to be the most talented student in years. So I’m sure you’ll become a great knight, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>No need to chit-chat. The noise around here is grating on my ears. Let’s go already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Aww! Tell me more about yourself! We’ve only just met!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Whaa?! What’s wrong?! And what’s with that huge sword?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You’re my instructor, aren’t you? Then please instruct me. That’s all I need from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You come late, and you talk unnecessarily... If this keeps up, I won’t be able to accept you as my instructor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Please fight with me. In doing so, please show me that you have things to teach me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Huh? Wait! That’s so sudden!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I don’t need a response. I need to get stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
