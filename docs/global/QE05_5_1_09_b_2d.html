<td>It worked! Even we can fight against the Jam now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Kamui! It works!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Good. Now, let's get the carriage—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Tch! There're still more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Kamui! We don't have time for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I know, but if we try to force our way through, we'll be cursed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Then what should we do?! Should we use more of that drying agent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No, we've confirmed how useful it can be. We need to spare as much as possible for the Liberation Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It can't be helped. I'll stay back while—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Don't be a fool! You must go with them! You must be the one who ends this hundred year long battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Th-that voice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huzzaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Georgios?! What are you doing here?! What happened with Gluttony's army?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>They've all been consumed by the Jam. Ceclidis seems to be trying to replace all of his soldiers with the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's appalling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We were nearly wiped out as well, but the desert landscape saved us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Looks like you figured out their weakness as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ironic, isn't it? That land becoming a desert was the doing of Gluttony Foss, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That desert is also the exactly environment the incarnation of Gluttony's vices cannot thrive in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's all that gave us the chance to make it here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Boss! We've gathered the best Spiritbonders from within the Fruit Peddlers! Leave this place to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Y-you guys...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You've got a delivery to make, don't you? You can count on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But...there are so few of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You shouldn't underestimate us. Our might far outstrips this challenge. We'll follow as soon as we clear this area!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Go! Finish this, once and for all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Now then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's been a while since I've used my powers of purification, but it's never too late to get back in the saddle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'll have you accompany me in my warm up before the big fight!</td>
