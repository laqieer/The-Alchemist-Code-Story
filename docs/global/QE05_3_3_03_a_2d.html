<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>That should do nicely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Thank you. This is quite a relief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Be on your guard. Beasts are much better than us at using the surrounding terrain to their advantage. You could lose your head if you're not careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I...will be sure to bear that in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ah, if only we had a scout among our number as agile as you! Perhaps you would consider joining our cause? We do pay rather handsomely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>My skills are meant for survival. I have absolutely no interest in your gold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I...see. That is quite a shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ah! There is our fortress in the distance! Can you see it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So you're back, Adelbert—and you've brought guests!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes, Your Highness! They have come all the way from the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I am Kamui, head of the Fruit Peddlers' guild. I have hastened here at the request of Lady Marie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I see. Is she safe? She isn't injured, is she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>She is well. She is awaiting our return at our home base.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I am relieved to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Perhaps we should get to the matter at hand, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>As we speak, my father, Ceclidis I, is building an army with which he intends to invade the Desert Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We have done what we can to stop them, but we have reached our limit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>At this rate, they should reach the border in less than three days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What?! The desert border? Now?! In the middle of all this chaos of the civil war?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>My...father intends to suppress the domestic rebellion with an iron fist. We had also decided to take that stance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hence why it took us so long to react—too long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We have sent a runner to inform the people of the desert about this, but I really think that you would be more suited to delivering this message.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The desert and the Sephira are our secret weapon. We need them to take down my father. We cannot afford to lose them here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I want you to make all haste back to the desert and find a way to prepare for a counterattack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Understood. Is the merchant caravan I sent from the Fruit Peddlers still here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It is. We have done what we can to accommodate them in our fortress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>In that case, I will make use of their carriage to get the message to the desert as quickly as possible. It would be best if we could talk more, but in these circumstances...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Indeed. However, our top priority must be saving the people of the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Long have we of Gluttony Foss forced our rule upon the desert dwellers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yet you still came all this way, simply to heed my request. I want to respond in kind to such decisive action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Adelbert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yes, Your Highness! All of the necessary preparations have been made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Your Highness! You don't mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Adelbert and these few soldiers will accompany you. I leave their command in your capable hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>There you have it. My soldiers are accomplished marchers in all kinds of terrain, from mountainous to wasteland. We should be able to reach the desert a step or two ahead of the troops dispatched from the royal capital.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Understood. Thank you, Your Highness. I am grateful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Please... Take care of Marie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>All right, my fellows, it is time to march! We are in a hurry here, so you have my explicit permission to rout anyone or anything who stands in your path, whether they be man or beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huzzzaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The desert? You think that place I saw in my vision was the desert? I don't know—something doesn't feel right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We can think about this later, Tina. For now, we must put the lives of our people first. Logi! You can ride a horse, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yeah! I'll put Agatha up behind me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>A-all right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Let's go! There's no time to waste!</td>
</tr>
