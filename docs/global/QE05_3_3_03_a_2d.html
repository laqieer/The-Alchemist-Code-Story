</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yes, of course.</td>

<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>As we speak, my father, Ceclidis I, is building an army with which he intends to invade the Desert Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>We have done what we can to stop them, but we have reached our limit.</td>
</tr>

<td>At this rate, they should reach the border in less than three days.</td>

<td>What?! The desert border? Now?! In the middle of all this chaos of the civil war?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>My...father intends to suppress the domestic rebellion with an iron fist. We had also decided to take that stance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>Hence why it took us so long to react—too long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>We have sent a runner to inform the people of the desert about this, but I really think that you would be more suited to delivering this message.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>The desert and the Sephira are our secret weapon. We need them to take down my father. We cannot afford to lose them here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>I want you to make all haste back to the desert and find a way to prepare for a counterattack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Understood. Is the merchant caravan I sent from the Fruit Peddlers still here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>It is. We have done what we can to accommodate them in our fortress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>In that case, I will make use of their carriage to get the message to the desert as quickly as possible. It would be best if we could talk more, but in these circumstances...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>Indeed. However, our top priority must be saving the people of the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>Long have we of Gluttony Foss forced our rule upon the desert dwellers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>Yet you still came all this way, simply to heed my request. I want to respond in kind to such decisive action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>Adelbert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Adelbert and these few soldiers will accompany you. I leave their command in your capable hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>There you have it. My soldiers are accomplished marchers in all kinds of terrain, from mountainous to wasteland. We should be able to reach the desert a step or two ahead of the troops dispatched from the royal capital.</td>
</tr>
