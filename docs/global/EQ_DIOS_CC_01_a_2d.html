<td>Whoaaa! Huff...huff... That dream again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Sir Dias, Lord Gabirond has summoned you. Please come to the Holy Chamber.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yea. I'll go right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There you are, Dias. It's about time you've grown accustomed to being a Paladin, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Enough of your hollow greetings. Tell me what you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmm. Very well. It's regarding the Sacred Stones...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Excuse me! Lord Gabirond, we've received a request for reinforcements from the troops you sent to Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Such trivial events again. I told you to ignore them, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>However...at this rate, the peace will continue to deteriorate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Did you not hear my voice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>M-my apologies...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wait. Regarding reinforcements, I will go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What are you saying, Dias? Don't tell me you've already grown homesick for your country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Say what you want. I will act on my own will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Very well then. However, try to clean things up within four or five days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Three days is plenty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, he seems surprisingly enthusiastic. I guess the necessary shackles must be found for the difficult tools...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I never expected to return here in this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh...Dias? What's he doing here...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Apparently, he's the "hero" that struck down traitor Zeke. Ultimately, he's nothing more than an ungrateful kin-slayer. He's not worthy of bearing the name of a Paladin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Are you the Peacekeepers? Where are the bandits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Who knows? We're having a hard time finding them ourselves. After all, they're quite skilled at hiding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The people of Wratharis like to attack when their opponent is turned the other way. I guess they excel at cowardice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What? Did I upset you? But you're from Envylia, aren't you? What do you have to be upset about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(I see. It seems like word has spread that I was born in Wratharis.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'll search for the bandits myself. You spend your time doing as you please. I have no intention of giving you orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What's with his attitude? After all, he's originally nothing more than a lowlife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Help! The bandits have appeared in the neighboring village! Hurry, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Argh... Those Wratharis rats!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The Peacekeepers...it appears the bandits are on the move.</td>
