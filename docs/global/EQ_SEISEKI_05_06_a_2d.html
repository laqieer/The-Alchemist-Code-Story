<td>Argh! Why?! Why doesn't anyone try to understand me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>If I cannot convince Zain...this world could very well be consumed by war!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wait...</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>?!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Monzein! You came at the perfect time. Help me stop Zain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Lord Commander is too much for me to handle on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Kudan...tell me what happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>All right. We don't have much time, so I'm gonna keep this simple. Zain's true motive is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's not what I want to talk about. Seida and the others are lying on the ground over there. Were you the one who did that to them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No, listen! She...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Give me a straight answer. Are you the one who hurt Seida?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yes...it was me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>When I warned you at Saga...you made a vow to change your ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>As your fellow knight...as your friend, I believe those words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I understand. When I made that vow, I really had changed my ways. I spoke the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Then why? Why did you sell your soul to the devil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No! That's a misunderstanding! It's true that I talked to that man Waginau, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>By no means did I open my heart to...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>How unfortunate...Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Back then...when you took a step onto the wrong path, I couldn't stop you. It's all my responsibility!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Kudan...I will stop you now! Hurraahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Stop, Monzein! ...Stop!!!</td>

<td>Mistress!</td>

<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I knew it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It wasn't a trick of the eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Aren't you supposed to have equal the amount of power as Zangetsu? What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Right back at you. And what would someone like you be doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Wh-what?! You know each other, Suzuka?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This is Reimei. He makes his livelihood as an assassin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>An assassin...?! You mean a killer?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yep! His existence became known to me after...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...the assassination of Priestess Chihaya's predecessor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>His skillful handiwork suggests there are numerous assassinations yet to be discovered and made public.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What is such a terrifying killer doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You sound as if you've never gotten your hands dirty before. Heheh. You make me laugh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's hard for me to understand why you, who lives by the warrior's code, would team up with this lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>They're the ones who hired me to assassinate Chihaya, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What are you saying?! Don't speak nonsense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>So you're gonna feign ignorance. In that case, we'll see how your body responds!</td>
