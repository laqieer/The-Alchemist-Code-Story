<td>What is going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>They've lost their minds to suspicion and paranoia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Could this be the doing of the Hidden Ogre?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Is it able to do things like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Just stay close to me. You are a little too earnest, always taking things at face value. I believe this'll put you at a disadvantage against the Hidden Ogre.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Y-you're the Blade Fox!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You can't fool me! I know you're trying to kill me too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'll kill you before you kill me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This could be a little troublesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What is this?! We should be fighting demons, not people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The Hidden Ogre must be among them. That alone could sow discord in a population, causing people to hurt one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>People will do whatever it takes to protect themselves. You never know who will betray you for their own sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wait, so the Hidden Ogre's power is to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It can mimic a human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Don't! We shouldn't be killing each other! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>P-please! Help me! They're going to kill me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hey! Don't worry, we're here to help!</td>

<tr>

<td>Wait...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Agh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wh-what are you doing?! She was—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Overcome with corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Grrahck! Gaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>A d-demon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I can smell it on them. The fear and doubt sowed by the Hidden Ogre has taken control of her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The corruption then grew within until she became a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Demons in the form of humans devouring people. This truly is mayhem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This is...horrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>People's most hideous, violent nature brought forth by fear and doubt. It's hell on earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I see now why the Hidden Ogre, a pure-blood demon is such a threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Fear and doubt driving people to murder...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You're a demon too, aren't you?! You're going to eat me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'll kill you before you kill me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This is how the pure-bloods proliferate corruption within and among people. Corruption born from negative energy is one of their favorite things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>This is my first time actually seeing it, but...this is worse than I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hey! Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We need to find and eliminate the Hidden Ogre before more people get hurt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Amane, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'll let you know as soon as I find it! Let's split up, Captain Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Who put you in charge?! Hold on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Dang it, she makes it so hard to protect her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Third Squad, spread out! Keep an eye out for the Hidden Ogre as you help civilians evacuate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If the Hidden Ogre is sighted, immediately signal me with a beacon! Got it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Amane, don't be reckless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Why is this happening? Why are people hurting each other? Demons are the ones we should be fighting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Waaah! I was so scared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You're okay now. Where are your parents?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I got lost, and... W-will you help me find them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>"Demons must be eradicated."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(I-I can tell... I don't know how, but I can tell.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>(This child is a demon. Even such a young child has been taken by corruption.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Hello?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Wh-what are you...!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'm so sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>N-no, wait...! Grr...! Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You must've been so scared... So lost... I'll set you free, but I won't let you go alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Grrraaaaaarrgh!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I promise you. For the sake of your lost future, I will make sure peace is brought to Wadatsumi!</td>
