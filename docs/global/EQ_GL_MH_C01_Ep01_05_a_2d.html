<td>Morning Sieg! I plan to head out for a hunt, care to join?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Certainly.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Good, this hunt is meant to secure the surrounding area before the ceremony starts tonight.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>May I ask what the ceremony is about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmm... It's an important tradition in our village to offer our thanks to the Divine for the protection offered. I can't tell you more but I'll see if you can meet the village Speaker after we are back.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Once the ceremony is done, it should be okay for you to visit the shrine and learn more about the Divine Protector of this village.</td>

<td>Enough talking about that, let's go patrol around the area and make sure the lizardmen don't get any funny ideas about the village.</td>
