<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Wow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This is our home now. A hidden village built by an ancient people...or what's left of it, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Incredible! It's like a magic kingdom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We're back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, my! So this is the Phantom Soldier who will seal the Darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What's wrong? The summoning worked, didn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No... You don't mean to say that it failed? Why did you bring her here, then? Are you just going to dump her on us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We don't have room for layabouts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>K-Kasumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Bwirr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Are you all alone, little one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That makes two of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Bwirru!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Look at you! You flap those little wings! Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I think I'll call you Flappy. Would you like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Bwirruru?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>U-um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Liz...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I... I'm sorry! We called you all the way out here, and...tasked you with all of this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Not at all! I mean...I'm useless to you otherwise, aren't I? There's no denying that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>K-Kasumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's strange, though... I would have thought that only really powerful or talented people would be able to become Phantom Soldiers. It just doesn't make sense for an average high school student like me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>High...school?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh, um... You don't have schools here? S-sorry... I shouldn't have brought it up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No! I want to hear about your world. I'd love to! We do have schools here, so that part I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well... I attended my highâ€”my school every day, but I was just a normal student. I never had any special abilities or...anything special, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I was there today, too. At school, I mean. Then I went to bed, and heard a strange voice calling to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Th-then...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Before I knew it, I was here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I-I'm so sorry! It sounds like I summoned you while you were still alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Really...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I don't understand. Why did this happen? You're clearly not the Phantom Soldier who can seal away the Darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Unless... There's some other meaning behind it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No need to waste your energy pondering that. You should be thinking about how you can send her back. We need her gone, fast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We can't afford to keep her here. We're hanging on by a thread as it is. Even one new addition is more than enough to sink this ship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Edgar! That's enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If she's no good to us...then we can't afford to waste our resources on her. It's as simple as that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>All those children... Their families aren't...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>K-Kasumi...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Is... Is there anything I can do to help? Anything at all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Who's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I guess she must be the useless Phantom Soldier the grown-ups were talking about, huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You can't do anything. And even if you could... Pfft.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Well, we haven't finished making dinner yet. Aw, man... I'm getting really sick of eating the same stuff every single day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Dinner? That's something that even I could help with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>H-hey...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It's a shellbug shell. You can't eat just the shell, so it's no good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Okay! I'll use this to...and then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>There we go! It's all ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Whoa! It smells really good! Can I try some?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Of course! Eat as much as you like!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Umgf... Yum! You're amazing, lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Can I have a taste? Oh! This is delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Come on, Edgar! Try some! It's really good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It's been a while since I saw the little ones smiling like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'm heading back. Time for bed, you three.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yessir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Edgar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I know he seems cold, but I hope you won't think too poorly of him. He was a completely different person, once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Compassionate, easily moved to tears and easily carried away... Finishing every sentence with a punchline...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Never let a girl cry: that's my policy. Nothing in this world could be more important to me than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That's something he used to say a lot, back in the day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Pfft! Are you serious? I totally can't imagine it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Yes, well... Then he got caught up trying to save everyone, going around fighting the Demons of Darkness... I think it's left him scarred in more ways than one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huh? Wh-what the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>L-Liz? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It's only faint, but I can feel Alchemia! It's coming back! But...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What? I thought you said that Alchemy was sealed because the...the Destrolurk possessed the Tower of Babel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Right! That's exactly why it's strange!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Maybe I could fly on Broom Ace again! No, better still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Maybe I could use magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Y-you can fly? Wow... You're amazing, Liz!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>No... No, I'm really not. I used to be a student, too, you know; and a terrible one, at that. I was always falling behind at school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>What? Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Yes. The only reason I've managed to come so far is because of the help I've received.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I... I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Bwirr?! Bwirru! Bwii!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Flappy...? What's wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>We're under attack! The Demons of Darkness are here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>How did they find us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Come on, Lisbeth! I need your help! We must keep them from the village at all costs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Okay! Kasumi, there's a shelter behind the village. Go! Take cover!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>B-but I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
