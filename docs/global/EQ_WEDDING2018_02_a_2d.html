<td>Something feels...different from before.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It always felt like there was a wall between the men and women of Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Now though...I don't really know how to put it, but it seems like they're both working to be equal in the relationship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hehehe. It makes me kind of happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This won't do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No! There's still not enough love! Hey, you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hmm? Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You've been hiding and watching that boy, haven't you? That must mean you're in love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If you just sit there looking, you'll never have a chance with him! If you never make a move, then you'll never get married!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Go talk to him! Now! Get over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Uhh... E-Excuse me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You've been watching me, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I want you to know that...I've been watching you this whole time too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>R-Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I think you and I would go well together. Would you please go out with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh my gosh! Of course I will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You have to be kidding me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I was the perfect Cupid, huh? If we keep at it like this, it's just a matter of time until the weddings get started!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>All right, let's keep this going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You never stop to rest, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>She's just forcing everyone who makes eye contact into relationships...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This time she's demanding those two over there date, simply because they tried to grab the same book at the same time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh, look. She's leading a boy around the back of the School of Magic! Oh... She's forcing a girl to confess her love back there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>She's being a total nuisance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So this is why they call her Mad Cupid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why do you think she's so crazy about weddings?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmm...now that you mention it, there must be some kind of reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well, you see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm back! I paired up sooo many couples!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yeah, we saw. It was pretty...amazing. In more than one way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Now then! Now that I understand how things are going in Lustburg, and I got to play Cupid a bit, the next thing we need for our bridal rehearsal is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hey, you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ah, you're the girl from the Academy of Magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Since you forced me to confess, the mood was completely ruined and he turned me down! How are you going to fix this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Umm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'll never forgive you!</td>
