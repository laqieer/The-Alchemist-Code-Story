<td>Are you sure you're all right with this, Vice-Captain Monzein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...With what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Seida of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>She no longer belongs to the 2nd Regiment. Forget about here. No more talk. We advance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Did you really have to speak to her like that?! Have you forgotten how you two worked together on the bridge?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Silence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I understand your perspective, Vice-Captain. If the lives of everyone in this world is in danger, then it's our duty to remove that threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But you didn't have to speak to her like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You told Seida to stand by and let the people of Alize...her people, get slaughtered!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I said silence!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>

<td>Under these circumstances, their sacrifice was unavoidable. However you say it, it won't change the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Was it really unavoidable?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>My teacher Seida said that the Sacred Stone wasn't in Gluttony. What if that's really true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Nonsense! That theory has no basis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What're you saying is just speculation as well! You have no proof that it wasn't a trap set by the enemy, yet you've already decided that it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What're you gonna do if the Sacred Stone isn't in Gluttony and knights are at the temple?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Silence! Don't meddle in things you know nothing about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It doesn't matter what the truth is or not. I am the vice-captain. I am your commander! You just need to silently follow my orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Fine. I get it now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I knew you were stubborn, but I didn't think you were such a blockhead, Vice-Captain Idiot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>V-Vice-Captain Idiot?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'll go help Seida, even if I have to do it alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's the spirit! You're not alone. I'm coming with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>He-hey! Wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Tsk! At a time like this...!</td>
