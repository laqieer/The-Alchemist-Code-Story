<td>A gauge... Just a gauge?!</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>With the Discarnate Power's body as its base, yet room for further growth on top, there was so much potential from the very start. But potential alone does not a weapon make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>To measure its strength and fine-tune the end product, I needed strong opponents. Regular soldiers wouldn't do, and I certainly couldn't target Greed Dike's forces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But then I found you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Demon slayers...who exist to counteract the very forces you used as your model...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's right. I gathered all the strongest-willed people of Wadatsumi—those who dared stand up to the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I banded them together into an organization, and trained them to become experts at their craft. Once that milestone was reached, others scrambled to join their ranks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>One amazing person after another! The Successor of the Black Star, the descendant of the Kagomurasaki...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Not to mention a former Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard, with ties to the house of Rising Ashes. How could I not take advantage of the gift that was handed to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The stronger the group, the stronger my weapon becomes—and the more worthwhile my experiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So we were just being used? This whole time, it was all for your benefit?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's right. And with you as commander, the Blade Fox Corps grew stronger than ever—strong enough to conclude these experiments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's been almost too perfect, really. An organization like the Blade Fox Corps isn't just well-suited to these tests...it's practically ideal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But now that my weapon is complete, the Blade Fox are no longer necessary, I'm sorry to say. I must again thank you for everything, though, before sending you off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Now, now. Don't scrunch up your face like that! You've been so helpful. You should feel privileged for the part you played!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>And the purging of the Scarlet Flame Guard, on top of it all... I never could've foreseen how well it would all go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The Scarlet Flame Guard... Was Greed Dike involved with that as well?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And what if we were?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then you will pay dearly for your heinous crimes!</td>
