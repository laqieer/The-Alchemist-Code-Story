<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Your friends left the three of you behind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Well, we can't leave the airship completely undefended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Someone has to keep watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Besides, we can still communicate if we need to. That's why Mira went with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Right... Because of your Space-Time Manipulation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes. I'm not acclimated to the magil of this region yet, so teleportation is out of the question, but just speaking with Mira should pose no problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Without any magic tools or anything? Wow, some of the other regions are seriously advanced!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>From my perspective, the technology of this region is just as impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This region prioritizes the common good over individual profits. One person's progress isn't limited to that person's individual growth alone. It's a wonderful thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The fact that technology, and its various benefits, is available to everyone here... That's a philosophy that is more powerful than I could have imagined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm happy to hear that, but with the government in its current condition, that philosophy is nothing more than an empty promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Anyhow, I confirmed the availability of the materials Adaleigh needs. I mean, it's going to take some time to have them delivered, but that can't be helped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I expect that by the time Adaleigh gives up and comes back, they should be ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Pardon me. I've been wondering...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What's the matter, miss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Just...what kind of relationship do Icona and Adaleigh have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I just couldn't help but wonder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ah, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So Icona is sort of his senior in terms of engineering studies. They both came from the same orphanage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Orphanage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>They lived down below. It's tough down there. A harsh environment and rigorous labor keeps the life expectancy pretty low compared to those in the "above."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Above? Below? Ah, you mean the city and the surface that Icona spoke of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah, so you've heard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Only a handful of people get to live in the floating cities, but for this region, that's just how it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But those two had a rather strange set of circumstances...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Circumstances?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Brains. Smarts like you wouldn't believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I thought Father was joking when he brought them up, but they proved their worth in no time, and now they're officially Engineers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>They didn't just let their dreams be dreams. I really admire that about them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Even after all these years, she keeps an eye on him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>However... No, never mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>In any case, Icona's like a big sister to Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's all I really know about them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What's up with you, Adaleigh? Apologizing out of nowhere like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But your arm... Had I been more careful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You mean this? Don't bother worrying about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It was just flesh. I'd been thinking it was time for an upgrade anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>See? Look, this thing's so useful! My mechanical arm eliminates the need to carry around equipment and tools.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And look: it's made of the same alloy that I plan to use for airship armaments, so it's super strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Th-that's not what I meant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You wouldn't have gotten hurt at all if only I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Adaleigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>How long are you going to dwell on the past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There's no point in being scared of making mistakes. Just look back, analyze your mistakes, and try again, do better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The important thing is to learn from failure, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...This is the Mayor's office.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No one's here. What is going on...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>There are so many weird tools in here! Hey, what's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Don't touch anything! It could be dangerous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Jeez, just tossing around chemicals like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It looks like Icona was here a lot. She really has no space in her mind for something like "crisis management."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>This model...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It's a model of the floating city. You see that in the middle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>We saw this under the witch's mansion. Stones that draw their power from the transmutation of life itself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, you're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It looks just like it, right?! I was surprised when I saw it in Luxuria, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Adaleigh, what is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>This is the fuel mined from the underground caverns of this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Mined? This rock can be found underground in this region?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>We call it the "Stone of the Gods."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>No one knows its origin, let alone how it exists at all. Some theorize that it might be an ancient fossil, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...Of the Gods...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But it's weird. In Luxuria, this stone was transmuted from the magil of living things, but this is rock that we dug up from under the surface...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>If they're both the same thing, how did this get underground?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Apologies for the interruption, but I've found something interesting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What is it all the sudden? Oh, this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It looks like some kind of report. Something to do with the scouting of the tunnels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Indications of illegal mining. Further investigation required immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Does this mean that the mayor has gone to the surface to investigate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>There's a high likelihood of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Maybe Icona's there too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>She did say that the mayor summoned her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>So we just missed them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>C-come in! Report! Fallen have been spotted in the underground mining area! Repeat, Fallen have been spotted—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What? Fallen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Where! Where is your exact location?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>And you are? This is a direct line to the mayor's—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>This is Adaleigh, Official Engineer of Redington! I came to meet the mayor but... Whatever! Just tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>U-understood! Fallen have appeared in Redington management division F, and there are injuries reported! Please send reinforcements—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Is Icona with the team? Is Icona there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Affirmative! However, she got separated from the party and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Got it! We're on our way! Nimul, it's okay, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Of course it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>First, we need to go down to the surface! The airship should be able to handle that for now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Then we should act immediately. Mira, can you send word to Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Okay! Leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
