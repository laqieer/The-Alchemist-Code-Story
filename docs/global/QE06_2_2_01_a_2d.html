<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>You want me to enlist in the Wadatsumi army?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I thought I made it clear long ago that I refuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There is a shortage of new recruits…especially qualified ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Save it. I told you--these hands only wield kitchen knives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That wasn't always the case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…Yeah, but those days are over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I can't fulfill your request. Go home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That won't do… Demons have appeared who can nullify chakra.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Chakra used to be effective against them…but these demons could nullify the Phoenix Brigade's every move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>They must be using chakra--or something comparable--in order to nullifies our powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>…We could be in grave danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What do you have to worry about? You still have the arcane art, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…Both Kagutsuchi and the arts of the Phoenix Brigade stem from the Phoenix Covenant passed down through generations of the Aquila Rubrum royal family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>For now, nothing can surpass the Kagutsuchi…but somewhere along the line, that may change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>…So what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We may become outmatched by the demons… I want to solidify our strength before that happens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Come on. We're talking about the pinnacle of our arts--that which was carefully developed by the royal family to protect Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If it could be surpassed so easily, the people would lose hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's why I'm here…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Fighting power with power… That's always been your strategy--but not mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If Kagutsuchi were to be destroyed someday, Wadatsumi would fall into the demons' hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>…That's not my concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…I need you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Has that line ever worked?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This isn't a joke…! The very future of Wadatsumi is at stake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You're the only man I know with enough chakra to endure the Phoenix Covenant…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You were once a Demon Hunter for a reason. Please…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You're not even going to consider it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>…I swore long ago the only blade I'll wield is in the kitchen. I thought I made myself clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…I refuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Why? Your abilities are second to none and you possess the ideal amount of chakra. Won't you lend us your support…for Wadatsumi's sake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>…What ever happened to the demons we hunted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...That's beyond my purview. Unfortunately, there is much I do not know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Then why enlist my help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I was told to find someone capable enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You don't even know what's going on in your own country? You only care when it's convenient for you. It's pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Denigrate me if you must. I'll accept it all in the name of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>A country that takes life for granted deserves to fall…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...I have no intention of taking up arms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>If not arms, then what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>…Well…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>…I'll make do with kitchen knives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You haven't changed a bit since then…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I prefer life-giving meals to life-taking war. That--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Is my atonement for the lives I've taken, and my own way of fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>If we fill their stomachs, then maybe they'll stop eating us. If both sides have their basic needs met, the fighting should end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Only then will there be any lasting peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>…That's a fantasy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Better to fantasize about a better future than to give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>…I haven't given up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Then you've got it all backwards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…You said there's a demon who can use chakra, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If such a demon exists, who's to say there aren't also demons who don't devour humans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>…Impossible. Demons devour humans. Period. That is why they're our mortal enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>…But…it is possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Even if my dream is a long shot, I'm glad I haven't given up. I've come this far, so I've got to follow through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>My food...will bring peace to Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Kaede…still hasn't returned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It appears not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>She must be too weak to move…I should go find her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Calm down, Tamba. You'd be a fool to put yourself at risk for one demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It's far riskier to lose Kaede and have our strength diminished. In order to wipe out those damned humans…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>We need her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>…Yes, you may be right. We can't allow any more damage to our side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>She hasn't replenished her life force yet. What if she's trapped somewhere and the humans find her…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>…We'll deal with that when the time comes. Once you become the king's vessel, nothing can stop you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Are you saying we should abandon Kaede…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Survival of the fittest--that's the law of nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>…!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I'm moved by your loyalty to you sister…but she's naïve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>It's not just Kaede. I have a promise to keep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>…Ah, yes. I remember--The day you both returned home covered in blood. You had escaped your human captors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>The youngsters kidnapped by vile humans were thought to have been killed… Imagine our surprise when you made it back here all on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>…You still despise humans, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>…A foolish question. I live with that hatred each and every day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Of course, of course. The anger you both harbor against humans--the "corruption"--THAT is your great power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>That "corruption" coupled with the unique power you possess--I'm convinced…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>You will surpass me and become the king's vessel, bringing about a new dawn for the demon race.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>…I don't know about all this "king's vessel" talk… but I'm in your debt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>So…I hope to meet your high expectations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I haven't done anything. What does this "debt" concept even mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>After we escaped from our abductors and returned here, the other demons blamed us for being too weak. But you took us in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>The other demons didn't realize the powers you possess--that of both human and demon…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I simply discovered that you are mixedbloods and guided you accordingly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>You mean the extremely rare case in which a child is born with a demon's lifeforce and the power of chakra?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Indeed. You and Kaede are exceptional in that regard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>…That aside, I vowed to exterminate all humans, and that's what I'm going to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Yes. Well said. What we demons need in order to survive is…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>The powers of you and your sister and the anger you harbor towards humans--that "corruption." That's to say nothing of the king's vessel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>You two will defend us against the humans' confounded arts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>We cannot allow them to intimidate us any longer. If demons are to rule this land…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Then we must destroy all humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>…I couldn't agree more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>(Especially the humans who made us suffer!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>(They're the worst of all! I'll hunt them down--every last one!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Hm… You are still not ready to be king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>…What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>One such as myself cannot comprehend human emotions, however...as long as your vision is clouded by the past…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>…You won't be able to achieve anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>We're running out of time. I wish for your awakening as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>…!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>…Kagutsuchi. That confounded art.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>It must not be underestimated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>We cannot let those filthy humans defeat us. That is why we must hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>…I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>…Look who decided to return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>…I'm back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>…Kaede!! Are you alright!? You're not hurt, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>…I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Where have you been!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Give her space, Tamba. First she needs to replenish her life force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>…Kaede, did you finally…devour a human?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>…No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Is that so? You seem to have a surprising amount of life force remaining. Well, no matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>You proved that you can stand up to the humans in our previous battle. Make sure you don't make the same embarrassing mistake again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>…Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Curse that Kagutsuchi… To think it's too powerful even for you two…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>…The one obstacle we'll need to overcome if we're to expel the humans from Wadatsumi… We will destroy it--it's only a matter of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>…I’m relieved to hear you say that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>…I'm sorry to have worried you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>…I wasn't worried, child. I leave that to him. Be sure to prepare adequately for our next battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>...Tamba</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I'm glad you're safe. Where have you been…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>…</td>
