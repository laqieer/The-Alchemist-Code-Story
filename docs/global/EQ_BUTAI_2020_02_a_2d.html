<td>It's not like me to do any teaching, but let me ask you this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Do you think there's such a thing as perfection?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Slothstein: Ruins (Memories)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The world as it is now can hardly be called perfect—not by a long shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yet is perfection even achievable? Of course, we ought to strive for a perfect world, but perfection in and of itself might be something twisted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Perhaps seeking perfection is just another form of pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>All we can do is our best, and continue to pass this task onto the next generation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Records of those who have done so before us can be found throughout history, and traces of them remain in ruins such as these.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>My goal is to unravel these things; to uncover the future that our ancestors sought for Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Is that why you told us not to come looking for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Those who wish to improve the future should first consider the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You're saying that we should turn our attention to history, and use that knowledge to gain a fresh perspective and learn new things about the present?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Exactly. And the greatest role I can contribute is that of the observer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This is what I was born to do. The more I delve into these secrets, the more I want to know. I won't rest until I've dredged up the deepest and most ancient secrets of the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Of course, not even these ancient records are perfect. There will be parts that I simply cannot penetrate, and parts that have been lost to time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's where my talent for inspired understanding comes in handy. When something's missing, I fill in the gaps—but that's half the fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I don't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I didn't expect you to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Kaya... You're needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The Holy Guard needs your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You really don't understand, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I just told you I didn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No, not that. I'm talking about me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Enlighten me, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You're a blockhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That doesn't tell me anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You're a mystery to me, as well, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You've said that you want to become the light that illuminates this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Right. And?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That fire has burned consistently within you. You reached the top of the Holy Guard, you became Lord Commander... and throughout it all, your dedication to the justice of the continent has not waned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You continue to seek perfect, complete peace, even though it does not exist. Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Simple. As Lord Commander, my purpose—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm not asking for the Holy Guard's stance on this. I'm asking for your own reasoning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm sure that's the correct answer for a Lord Commander to give...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But it doesn't sound like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I've been observing you for a very long time now, you know. I know you better than anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I... I am driven to pursue peace for the sake of the people of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What was wrong with that answer?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Really, now... Are you trying to provoke me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I could ask you the same question!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You said that the Holy Guard needs me. Correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>My strength?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What are you getting at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>If strength is all it takes to restore peace to this world, then make me return by force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>H-hold on, Kaya! I'm not here to fight you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ever the pacifist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hmhm... This exchange is making me rather nostalgic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I've never understood what makes you tick. Never.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Sometimes I don't know, myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>There are times when even I don't understand myself.</td>
