<td>But, if we're just going to pick a Stub Rule, we don't really have to overthink it, do we?</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>In your case, you usually act before you think anyway, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well...I was thinking about something else. I was wondering why my dad was willing to become an insect in order to give life to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Now that you mention that, it's true...isn't sacrificing your humanity going a bit far? Well, thanks to that I was born, so I'm not complaining.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah...that's why I was thinking if I find the Stub Rule, maybe I'll be able to understand my father's feelings a little better.</td>

<td>I heard that in the Helkovara family, in order to leave the best descendants, we used to buy men from other countries.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There aren't many marriages that were based on love in my family. Most of them were strategic marriages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'd also like to know what it feels like to be so passionately in love that you're willing to throw your life away.</td>

<td>Rebecca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh? Look at that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Is it a billboard?</td>

<td>"Please protect the forest by refraining from using magic in the vicinity."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>They're making it sound like this place is some spectacular tourist spot. It's just an unpaved forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, I'm sure it's mostly men that come here and they can't use magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If we can't use magic...how can we get across this cliff?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I think we can climb it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>In that case, can you climb it first? I've brought a rope just in case. You can tie it to the top of the tree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Wow. You're well prepared! It's hard to imagine you were against this trip in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well...um...you know, better safe than sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Thanks, Rebecca! You really saved me there! I thought we were gonna have to give up already...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...! Ju-just this once...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Heheh. All right, I'll drop the rope down from the top so climb it carefully!</td>
