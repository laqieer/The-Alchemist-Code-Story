<td>Well then, young lady...um, Lisbeth, wasn't it? About the way to get above the clouds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ye-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's true that Slothstein has airships, but...still, they won't go that high.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Really? That's so disappointing to hear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That being said, there was a guy who tried to make a vehicle that could go to the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>He's the only mechanic I could entrust with the maintenance of my buddy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>He wanted to look down at the clouds just once, so he made a rocket.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>A locket? One of those things you put around your neck?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No, a rocket. It's one of those rides that take you straight up into the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It used the engines that were made to fly the airships.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>He used three of those and flew it straight up to the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Three? You mean the airships flew on just one engine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah. That's how much power you need to fly above the clouds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You use one engine to fly you up to its limit, then, when it runs out of power, you switch to the next one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>By repeating this, he discovered a way to fly that high. Butâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Right before completing his goal, the engine exploded...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That crazy guy...he never came back down from above the clouds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Th-that's awful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sounds dangerous...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>For starters, there's no vehicle in this country with that much power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Of course, there is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You witches can fly with your own power, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The ones who caught me could fly as high as an airship. And there are three of you, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes...that's it! The three of us can try flying like a rocket!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I-I understand the theory behind it, but...do you think it'll work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>For starters, if we fly that high, we'll freeze.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The reason why there's a flight restriction is to prevent us from freezing to death, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No, freezing to death might be an exaggeration. Do you think they'd place valuable court mages in the sky just to prevent us from freezing to death?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Are you saying there's another reason...oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It's so that no one can get close to Asmodeus...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Now that we know the intentions of the queen, it's entirely conceivable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Height limit...right, that's why I was caught.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wow...just thinking about it is making me cold. Even with clothes, my body is getting unbelievably cold. If only I had some alcohol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>U-um...we do actually have some, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Whoa!!! That's caramel jaeger! I never thought I'd see it here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>All right then, I'll take some gratefully...aghh! It's hot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh?! Does it make you warm that fast? I heard that it heats your body, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I don't know who made that stuff, but just one gulp and I'm drenched in sweat...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That's it! If we drink this, we might not freeze even up in the sky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Are you being serious?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It may be sweet alcohol...but you want to fly drunk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You brats! What are you doing there?! Flying drunk...? Are you going to commit further sins?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yikes! They found us! At this point, it doesn't matter if we commit any further violations!</td>
</tr>
