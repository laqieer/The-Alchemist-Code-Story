<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Roast fish, venison steak, vegetable soup! This is a feast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I didn't know you could cook, Corvus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's not a particularly difficult skill. I learned the basics in order to impersonate a chef and infiltrate a noble household on an assassination job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wait a minute... Assassin cooking skills?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A-are you trying to poison us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Of course not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I dunno... How can we trust you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Enough fooling around. Come on, eat up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't mind if I do! Umgf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Mmm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Gimme some!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Mm-mmm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I can't believe it! This is delicious, Corvus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Umgf... Mmff... Umff... Umgf! So good! Like, crazy good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Good. I'm glad it's to your liking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What's the matter, Spica? Lost your appetite again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No, I just... I knew Letitia was a better cook than me, but I didn't expect to be outdone by you, too, Corvus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, I... erm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(Tell me, my darkness… should I be honest with her?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But you didn't cook anything—you just burnt it to a crisp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ila!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's only because we lived off of nothing but fruits and berries in the forest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>On the rare occasion we'd go into town to buy bread—but that was it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I've never seen Spica cook anything before today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Really? That was your first attempt, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Y-yes. I thought I just needed to heat things up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And you saw it as a chance to beat me... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Why don't you just get Corvus to teach you how to cook, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ila! I'm supposed to be teaching you the art of combat, not how to cook!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>C'mon, Corvus! Why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>If Letitia ever goes away again, you'll be on cooking duty every single night at this rate! Is that what you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Nrgh... Every single night? Gods, no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's what I thought!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's in your best interest to teach us all how to cook, so we can take turns making dinner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I suppose you have a— Wait a minute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>All of you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yup! I want to learn how to cook, too! Don't you, Ila?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Well, I do like Letitia's cooking—and Corvus's, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But I really don't like eating food cooked by other people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>So... yeah! I wanna be able to cook for myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Then it's settled! We'll be working together on this now, Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Um... R-right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Thank you, Corvus! I'll do my best to learn from you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(How did it come to this, my darkness?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It's been quite a while since I last saw this castle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I've put you through a lot, haven't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You were laying the groundwork for me in Wratharis the entire time I was in the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Oh? Is that your way of saying you appreciate my hard work? Hee hee. I'm flattered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But I have never once considered anything I've done for you to be an effort of any kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I merely waited patiently for you to come to me as a knight of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I remember your appearance on the battlefield like it was yesterday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The way your sword gleamed in the sunlight as you struck down countless Envylian soldiers in the blink of an eye...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The way you charged onto the battlefield like a proud stallion, your hair a fluttering mane of silver...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It was even more incredible than I had imagined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's in the past now. The Wratharis knights were just a stepping stone on our path to greatness. We must keep our eyes on the future, Letitia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>True. It's most unlike us to reminisce like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I expect we have our destination to blame for this sudden nostalgia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Haha... Probably.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It would seem even I have developed a sense of longing for my homeland.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I suppose this is what happens when you have companions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hee hee. We've both lived very long lives; I think it's only natural to allow yourself such indulgences from time to time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Indulgences? Hmph. Perhaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Shall we proceed, my sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yes, Zahar. Let's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>So, these are the dishes you prepared?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Yup! I made the vegetable salad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I did the fish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I roasted the meat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I see... Well, I'm afraid you've all failed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You only cut up vegetables, Silma. That's not cooking—nor is carving up a raw fish, Ila.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>The dishes you've prepared might be food… but they're not meals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>What about mine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You overcooked it. This isn't roast meat—it's a burnt lump of flesh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Ugh! This is way too difficult!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I don't wanna do this anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You're giving up already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I-I'm not giving up! Let me try again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Very well... Go on, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Excuse me... sir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I'm not sure our stores can withstand another attempt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Hmph. In that case, I'm afraid your next attempt will have to wait, Spica.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Well, you three… Thanks to your cooking practice, we're running low on ingredients. What am I going to cook tonight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>(How did they manage to use up so many ingredients, and yet only produce raw fish, vegetables, and meat?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Sir! Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>What is it now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>The group who went into the forest to go hunting has been gravely injured!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>They said they were attacked by a mythical beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>What?! That thing's still hanging around?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Spica, Silma, Ila—you know what this means, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Yep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You can count on us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Let's go, Corvus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>We have to take down the beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Feel anything yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>No... Nothing yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Yeah... It's kinda scary. I can't sense anything. Like, anything at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Hey...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Yes, Ila?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I can't sense anything... but I can smell something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>You can?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Yeah... Blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>B-blood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Now that you mention it... It's a bit faint, but I can smell it, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>It's coming from over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Grrrrr... Graargh! Hrrrghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Is that a paladin it's eating?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>But why would a paladin be here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I think I know why.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>The basement we raided… They were conducting experiments on animals using Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>This creature probably escaped from there. It could've been a normal animal that got turned into a beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>It's just a theory, and I've got no way to test it—but as for that paladin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Do you think they followed the beast here and tried to recapture it, but ended up getting overwhelmed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I think it's a possibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Hah! Serves 'em right for experimenting on animals, the cowards!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Well, we can't just let it run around the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>It must have suffered so much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Spica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I'm sure it did. Being experimented on must have been... horrible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Oh, Spica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Corvus, this creature is suffering. Let me—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Let me save it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>If that's what you want... you know what you need to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Yes... Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
