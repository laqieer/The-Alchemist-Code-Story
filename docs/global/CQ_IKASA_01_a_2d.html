<td>Just a little bit further and I'll reach the ruins...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hopefully there won't be any trouble...</td>

<td>Though things should be alright, as it's easier to handle things by myself...</td>

<td>After joining the Holy Guard, it was quickly apparent that it wasn't what I was meant for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>"What is your purpose as part of the Holy Guard?" "What are you willing to defend?" I just don't have the motivation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But after leaving Wadatsumi I couldn't think of what to do. So my purpose was to become that little girl's dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It wasn't especially a bad place to be. I just couldn't find my purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Is it right for me to be here? But then again, I don't know what I really want to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>In any case, Button isn't here with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Being apart from her makes me feel empty, though I knew that would happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ikasa, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova. Why are you out here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I heard you were on your own. I just happened to be free and thought I could give a helping hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You're heading to the ruins of the base which used alchemy unlawfully, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes. To scout and see if there are any remnants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I see. Do you not want me to come with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I would never say such a thing to the person who helped me to join the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Then there isn't an issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I heard that you've become much stronger, so I'm eager to see you in action. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Ever since I was recruited, the captain's watched over me, which is flattering... But why?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What's wrong, Ikasa? Something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh...uh... Nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We're close to the ruins. We'd better hurry before it gets dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I'll go faster.</td>
