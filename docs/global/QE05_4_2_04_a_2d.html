<td>001</td>
<td>H-how?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I am not the same as I was before, either, Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Setsuna gave me confidence, the Blue Tongues accepted me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And I myself have chosen! I will never lose anyone again! I will make sure that I protect all those in need of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>H-he's so fast! How can he be faster than my blade?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Dias, this is the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I...lost? How?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Dias, you said that you wanted to protect us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Is that what caging us in a land far from danger really means?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't believe so. To protect someone, you must be with them. Have them by your side, even in times of pain and suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I believe that to truly protect someone, you must stand together and help each other out when you are in need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You are as idealistic as ever. Your way of thinking won't change the world! It hasn't changed the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And yet, you lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Georgios?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You both seem to have great ambitions for this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Both of you took up the sword in order to change this world. Am I wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Then the one to accomplish their ambition will be the one who is stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This world is built upon the general principles of the survival of the fittest. No matter how naive an ideal may be, the strong will realize it, while the weak will not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>As my violence was defeated by Saga's harmony, so, too, did your resolution lose to his naivety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's as simple as that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Logi, you should return to the oasis with the Blue Tongues for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Kamui... But... I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Your comrades are hurt. They need clean beds and ample rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But Dias is my—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Logi! They have come here for you. They are here because you have lead them this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Captain Logi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It is your responsibility to see them to safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>All right. Please... Take care of Dias for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hmph. Well, I shall go with them. Since your blade was shattered so magnificently, I'd say that that makes this as good an opportunity as any to have it completely reforged...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Dias Elysion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Do you wish to know why you were defeated by Logi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What? You know why, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>For a moment back there, Logi's abilities surpassed my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It wasn't just the Sacred Stone, either. Something else flowed from within him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Those who have dealt with the Truth can channel their will into strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I am well aware of that! To execute one's power through impulse alone would merely drown one in their own strength, ultimately bringing about their downfall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That is why I regulate my Alchemy by the strength of my own willpower; so that I will never have cause to regret again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I have trained my willpower to withstand the temptations of Alchemy's power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Indeed. Those who wield Alchemy must have a strong mental constitution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That alone will not let you reach the depths of Alchemy, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The depths...of Alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Willpower is not only meant for restraining the power of those who wield Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You must engrave your will upon the blank canvas of Alchemy by persisting in your belief of what it means to be just.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The will to do so, the way in which you hold on to your truth; this is what resonates with the Alchemy you wield and gives you strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The Truth will not respond to restraint and regulation alone. You cannot exercise the true powers of Alchemy without a deep understanding of your own self.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Logi understands this, and you do not. This is the difference that brought about your defeat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Then I may someday achieve the powers which Logi displayed today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That will be up to you. You have trials before you that you must first overcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Trials?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Curious, are we? Then take up your sword, Dias Elysion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>This may be difficult for you, but I shall call forth for you the trial you left behind so long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Fine. I will overcome whatever trial you place before me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Come with me, then. There is a training ground built by the Sephira not far from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Your trial awaits you there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It's...waiting for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>This is the training ground? It looks almost identical to the ruins from earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yes. This is one of the abandoned ruins. The Fruit Peddlers have renovated it into a training ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>There are very few alive today who can harness the powers of the Sephira, yet nonetheless we do need a place to impart its secrets on the next generation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That's enough irrelevant talk. What would you have me do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>There's no need to rush. Let's get warmed up first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Are you not the slightest bit interested in the Sephira's Spiritbonding?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I suppose I am. Come, then, and show me what the Sephira are capable of!</td>
