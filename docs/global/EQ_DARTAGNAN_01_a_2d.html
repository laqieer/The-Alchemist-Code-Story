<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Wow! Wow! Wow! There are normal people and machine people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Something is moving somewhere all the time. This city...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So this is Slothstein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>In recent years, development has been rapid, making this country's magic and technology the most cutting edge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A country of metal and machines, it is unlike our country of Envylia. However, its essence remains the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ack... Captain, you always speak in such a difficult way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hahah. Sorry. However, I want you to know many things, D'Artagnan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You have chosen to live as one of Envylia's Scarlet Flame Guard while carrying the savage blood of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That again? My homeland is Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, come now! The world is a large place. There are many countries! Anyway, this country is one of the stranger ones amongst them all. What do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's completely different from Envylia, but, maybe because of that, it's really fun! I like how it never sleeps!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I like it! I think I might be able to fall in love with this country!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I see, I see. Well, then perhaps in the future, you will serve as the bridge between the two countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Heheh...Captain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Please, wake up! Vice-Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh?! What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Like I said, if you sleep here, you'll catch a cold! Furthermore, my dignity...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yawn... Morning...morning? Good evening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes, yes, it's long past noon. In fact, I thought you were on vacation for a while starting from today, Vice-Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh...I'm Vice-Captain? Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ah, come on...she's still half asleep...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Mmm...I'm okay! My eyes are open! I'm awake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>By the way, where's the Captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The Captain is making adjustments to the alliance between Northern Pride and Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So I'm on vacation from now... Wait, will our knights be all right without me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hahah! Actually, with you and the captain out of the way, we'll be able to get much more office work done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh, really? That's great news!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wait, were you just totally disrespecting me right now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You always make snap judgments without carefully thinking things through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Did you know that you've been called the 'fastest and least contemplative knight in all of history'? You should think things through a little more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh? But it's cool being me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Anyway. It's your vacation, so just spend your time lounging around your room.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Actually, that sounds pretty great...no, no, wait! I'm supposed to be going back to Slothstein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Again? Next time you go abroad, a little more of an advance notice would be great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>If I did that, someone would try to tag along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Of course! Recently, there's been a lot of suspicious activity in Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's an allied country, but I can't afford to let you go alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But I wanna travel alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>V-Vice-Captain?! We're still talkingâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Get off my back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Sigh. They're all good people in the Guard, but sometimes they're way too over-protective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>All right, I'm gonna quickly get ready and get out of here! I wonder if Amis is doing well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wow, it's already noon! It took pretty long even at my pace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Was it called Slothstein railroad again? If only that spanned the entire continent, getting around would be much more convenient!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hey, D'Artagnan! You're back already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hey, old man, it's been a while! Do you have any new inventions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You really should be asking someone like Amis instead of an underling like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hmm, I see...so where's Amis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, around this time, she's usually...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Megistos! You've misappropriated the budget again, haven't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Looks like she's right in the middle of dishing out a reprimand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Aah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Listen, Amis. This is a necessary expense. The weight of our current turret is a problem. We can't load it onto our airships, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>How does that excuse taking the expenses from the Power Division's budget?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>For starters, if it can't fly then you can't call it an airship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It's because the Power Division's development is being delayed. It's got an abundant budget, but it's moving along at a snail's pace. Can't I just transfer a little of the budget to us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>No! Do you know how much pains I've been taking with budget allocation for each department?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yeah, preach it! Stop causing problems for Amis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Listen. We're putting together an improvement plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Unlike the Power Division, who still has no idea regarding the source of failure, ours is a much more constructive use of the budget.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Your excuses suck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Argh! Shut up, D'Artaggy! Did you come here just to stir up problems again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Oh! Oh! You said it again! You called me that weird name!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>First of all, you're an outsider. How did you even get in?! What's security doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'm not an outsider! The old security guard says I'm like his granddaughter and gives me cute little sweets!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>So you sweet-talked your way in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Are you causing problems for Amis again? As someone who follows the herd, you should be ashamed of yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Your logic is as beast-like as ever. Listen, we're technicians. We do have rank, but it's not an aristocracy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>An air...stock...sea? Is that one of those boats without sails that are always floating around in Sloth's harbor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That's a steam boat! Are you one of those...what are they called again...idiots?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Huh?! Why did you suddenly call me an idiot?! I may not be smart, but I'm not an idiot! You're just a big cannon-carrying idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Just listen to how idiotic you sound!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hey, Amis! What are you laughing about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Sorry. I've never seen you get so worked up in an argument that doesn't have to do with your 'baby girl'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Hey there, D'Artagnan. Sorry you had to see all of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Not at all, Amis. You're always cool in my book! Unlike a certain somebody.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Yeah, I get the hint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>So what brings you here today, D'Artagnan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Um, sightseeing? I thought you might be inventing something cool again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Seriously, what kind of tourist waltzes their way into the Slothstein's Central Technology Bureau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Also...oh yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>There was something that caught my interest during the joint military practice between our knights and Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Would you like to talk about it over tea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I was just thinking of taking a break.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Yeah! Sounds great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Megistos, would you like to join us? We still have to talk about the budget.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>No thank you. I prefer to cover myself in grease than attend fancy tea parties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Amis is going out of her way to invite you! You're never gonna get a girlfriend with that attitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Unfortunately, I've poured all my love into my baby girls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Jeez. That sounds wrong on so many levels...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>That sound! Is something exploding?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Hm? Hey, what's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Aghh?! Ack.. Someone, help! A prototype Guard Droid has gone rogue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Gone rogue?! But we've got the maintenance man coming in every week without fail!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Let's think of the reasons later! Right now, let's focus on rescuing the injured, Amis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Ye-yes! You're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Megistos, can you evacuate the people that are all right and, if you have time, use artillery to hold it back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>A-ah all right...I don't mind, but what are you gonna do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I'm going to go stop the rogue machine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Huh? On your own?! Isn't that a little risky?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Don't worry. I'll be fine. Besides...the Scarlet Flame Guard will never stand by and allow innocent people to get hurt!</td>
</tr>
