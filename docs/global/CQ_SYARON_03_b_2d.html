<td>Hyaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Now that's what I like to see! Watch for an opening, and when the time's right...strike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes, master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(Their technique is so much more polished than before.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(Won's teaching must really be resonating with them...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But if I do that all the time, they'll never have a chance to learn. I throw 'em in at the deep end because that's how they grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Instructions are important, but sometimes you gotta trust your students enough to take the reins off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Commander! Your orders!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(So that's what it means to be a commander... I get it now. I have to trust them and support them.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Commander? Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You're strong enough to handle this yourselves. Fight as you see fit and I will support you as necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes, commander!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(All those sounds that were so suffocated now sound so free.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(It's just like when I fought at Bertha's side...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh? Damn it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Commander!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm fine. More importantly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Look out! That's gotta be the leader!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...We really have to fight that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>There's nothing to fear. We just have to disrupt their formation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>And strike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We've cleared out the monster lair, so the village should be safe for the time being. If anything happens, please contact the Royal Knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I cannot thank you enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>And the same goes for you, Won. We'll be happy to enlist your services again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Whenever you need something punched, I'll be there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Thank you, Won. It's all because of you and your disciples that we brought this mission to a speedy close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Not at all. I should be the one thanking you for letting us tag along!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I only took this job in the first place 'cause this bunch needed a real battle to cut their teeth on. Experience makes for the best teacher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Anyways, color me impressed! Cutting down that great lumbering beast with one stroke... Now that's a true knight for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I couldn't have done it alone. The battlefield resonated with the sound of trust, and that gave me the courage to keep going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The sound of trust, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Come to think of it, you said your orders sounded...suffocated, was it? What happened to that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Actually, never mind. The answer's written all over your face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's right. They can breathe freely now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I finally remembered the kinds of sounds that my instructor resonated with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If I can teach those same sounds to my juniors, then the Royal Knights will become brighter and livelier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And it will resonate with more vibrant sounds, which I'll help pass on to the next generation. That's how I'll repay my instructor's kindness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Thank you, Won. It was you and your disciples who showed me the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Those sounds of yours are quite something, huh? Maybe they're just what I need to spread my way of the Tiger-King Fist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Maybe so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>All right! Time for me to master the power of music!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...Uh, mind if I ask for a couple pointers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Well... How about we start by having you listen to a stirring symphony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>A stirring symphony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Like the Envylia Philharmonic Orchestra. If anyone can show you just how magical music can be, it's them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Even when words fail you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Music can help you realize that you're not fighting alone. That there's someone by your side.</td>
