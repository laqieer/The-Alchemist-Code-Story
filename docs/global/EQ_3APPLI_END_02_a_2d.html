<td>Ack. She's even stronger than before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Until just before, I thought I could handle her myself. Now we're struggling, even with three of us.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I feel like she's three times as strong!</td>

<td>According to <p_name>, this place is a combination of three worlds.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Do you think that the Rayvner's power is three times stronger because of that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's so unfair! Why don't our powers also become three times stronger?!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>In the world that I know, both Sakura and Tyr have disappeared.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But what about Rena then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Rena and the Rayvner are the same beings, but there should be three versions of her in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Chloe, watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Chloe, what are you doing being so absent-minded during battle?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I feel like I'm just about to grasp something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What is this? There's a crack in reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I guess that means we're almost out of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes. There is no way to save me. Hurry up and destroy me...or else...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Its power is increasing more and more.</td>

<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It will consume and eradicate everything! Hurry...end it!!!</td>
