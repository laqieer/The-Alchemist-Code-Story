<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Where am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, you're awake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Y-you're—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You shouldn't be moving around so much after being baptized by Lucifer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Bap...tized...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Lucifer is different from the other regions' Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's an arbiter of those who should live and those who shouldn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And you, it deemed as one who should.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It...did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Why don't you join us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You could work to help save the world...as part of the Infinite Serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I refuse. I could never! I absolutely, positively disapprove of your organization's Ceremony of Creation. And nothing will change my mind about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But you lost to Lucifer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>After all your big talk, you lost. That's pretty definitive. It's honestly incredible to me that you still intend to stand against us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Of... Of course I do! Why wouldn't I? How couldn't I?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Who are you doing all of this for? That brother of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's right. I only live...for his sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Would you change your mind if I promised we'd spare your brother should you join the Infinite Serpent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That would be a meaningless gesture. My brother is the one who first proposed that it may be possible to save everyone and everything in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Then how about I help you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...Pardon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'll lend you my aid. I can help you achieve this fool's errand of yours to save the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's only natural to want to save those who can be saved, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Um... Thank you, I guess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You're a good kid. You know how to say thank you to others, unlike that bratty brother of mine. He's got a cynical quip for everything these days—after he thinks about it for a minute, anyway!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You have...siblings?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Just my one good-for-nothing little brother. Were you scared of him when you fought him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That was your little brother?! But...he looked older than you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm the older one! Me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Er... I'm sorry...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Why does everyone think he's older than me?! Are you all blind to my womanly charms?! I've spent ever so long carefully cultivating and nurturing them! It's not fair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, I'm sorry! It was an honest mistake. Please, calm down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Stupid Ignacio, with his stern-looking face and cool demeanor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'll have you know that I'm nearly a hundred years older than him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Y-you are?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I couldn't tell at all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Harrumph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh, no, I don't mean it like that! I just mean because Ignacio has the...uhh...face of an old man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Exactly. Well said. It's about Ignacio, not me. You're...not suggesting I have a baby face at all, right? Are you? Are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Of course not! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hehe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What are you giggling about all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I was actually really nervous when I heard we were coming to the Infinite Serpent's stronghold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>But even here, of all places, I can find people willing to lend me a hand, and chat casually with me about their family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It just all seems so absurd to think about, I couldn't help but laugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Well, worry not, human child. Our duty as high elves is to guide those who are lost yet determined to find their way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>As long as the light of your desire to save others does not fade, I will ever remain your ally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Now, it's time to let your actions speak as loudly as your words. Your wounds are all healed, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, they are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Naturally. I'm quite specialized in magic. We are trained to be beyond proficient with it, being high elves and all. In any case, let's get out of here, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Good day, Lady Helene.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>And welcome, esteemed guest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>We accept all here, so please rest well and cast away the worries of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Why doesn't anyone disdain me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Father has already announced you would be treated as a guest. The others don't dare question his judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Oh... I'd almost forgotten that you're Shahel's daughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>The ears are a bit of a dead giveaway. We high elves were created by the dragons, and serve as the Gardeners who oversee this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It's you humans who decided to start calling us "high elves."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Gardeners...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>It's a more apt term than you might think. Artificially cultured gardens require caretakers to tend to their upkeep, after all. And this world is exactly that: an artificially cultured garden—a fake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Don't go misconstruing things. I'm not saying you or anyone else who lives here is fake. Just the world itself, as it stands, is a carefully controlled construct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Anyway, we're here! This is the place I wanted to show you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What is it, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Right now, it's just an empty room. Not a soul in sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>My father, Shahel, is Superbia Belt's leader.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Then, there's the corrupted dragon—or as I like to call him, the dragon corpse—Zafeiris. And then the Space-Time Manipulator, Quence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>And from Acedia Belt, there's Icona, who's a total genius. And finally—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I recognize the writing on that one. That's Yna's, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>That's right! This is where those five gather to discuss the potentiality of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It's the heart of the Infinite Serpent. They call this room the "Serpent's Nest."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>The Serpent's Nest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Why did you bring me here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Well, you want to defeat Lucifer, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Yes, but there's no way I can do it with my strength alone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Of course not. Lucifer is an echo of the great dragon who serves as the physical manifestation of the Seven Miracles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>It's not a foe a mere human could ever hope to take on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>That's why my father came up with a plan. If he can't kill Lucifer himself, he'd just have to create a weapon that could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>He made a Gear of Judgment?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Quence came up with the concept, Icona designed it, Zafeiris collected all the materials, and Yna put it together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>And this gun is the prototype their combined efforts produced. It's called Zavijava.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>A gun? Um, do you happen to know how to use it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>It's a human weapon. A proper high elf such as myself would never bother with such things!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Then it's of little use to me, I'm afraid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Wait, so you don't know how to use it, either?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I've neither trained with nor even held such weapons as this before. But, hang on... Didn't Ignacio have something that looked like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Do you think we could ask him to—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Absolutely not. He'd report us to Father in an instant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Did you forget you're in enemy territory? You'd be a fool to think anyone here would help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>But, you're helping me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Well, that's only because...uhhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Because... Because I won't accept things as they stand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>(There's that word again. "Accept.")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Though I do so wish the humans would simply accept the fact that everything must be sacrificed, and move on already...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Do you mean to say you don't accept what Shahel said about the necessity of sacrifices?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>That's one way to put it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Whenever I question it, everyone just tells me I don't understand because I'm still just a child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>But I really don't understand, and I'm not a child! Who even decided this sacrifice was necessary in the first place, anyway?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I really want to know the answer. I just want something where I can hear it and say, yeah, that's the right thing to do. That's the way forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>And I feel like if I help you, I'll be able to find that answer. You'll help me see it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I don't think it's going to be quite that easy, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Why not? You do believe that there's a right way forward, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Does everything not all flow from the same source?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>If so, then there must exist an irrefutable Truth no one can deny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>And if there does, I have to find it. I can't bring myself to commit to anything until I do—until I know it's the right thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>And that, Lady Helene, is why everyone still regards you as a child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>...! When did you come in?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>My apologies. I found it curious that I could hear voices coming from this room, even though it was not supposed to be in use at this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Do you...intend to report this to Father?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Certainly not. Lord Shahel promised you freedom to do as you wish, and I shan't defy his orders. As you are not in the wrong, I have no reason to report you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>So you disagree with me fundamentally, but won't say anything because you were told not to? Do any of you ever think for yourselves?! Honestly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Our truth is in our leader. It is our will to follow him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>We believe Lord Shahel's judgments to be sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Therefore, we see no need to waver or doubt. As long as we continue to follow Lord Shahel, all roads will eventually converge upon the right path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Would you take your own life, then, should Shahel instruct you to do so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>If that be milord's will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>All that said, it would be troublesome if you caused too large a disturbance, so I'd ask that you please keep your gamboling to a minimum. If you'll excuse me, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Who was that man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>He's the Serpent Priest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>He's the one who's actually in charge of this region's affairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Father has no interest in politics or government, you see. So while Father has the final say, the Serpent Priest is the one who actually gets things done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Does something about him trouble you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Not exactly. It's just that his way of thinking...his blind faith...seems a bit radical for a leader, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Everyone here is like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Once they start believing something, they devote themselves to it wholeheartedly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Nobody asks questions. Nobody raises concerns. If someone they believe in says something is so, then it's so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Father respects that Pride of theirs, and holds it as a virtue worthy of admiration, but I don't agree. Blind faith just doesn't seem like the right path, to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>I wouldn't even call it Pride, myself. Almost by definition, you can't truly be proud of your accomplishments if you're just following orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>In a way, though, you're just like them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>What? Really? Do I come across that way to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>You're willing to literally lay down your life to fulfill an uncertain goal. How is that any different?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Oh, well... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Anyway, we need to figure out how to use that gun. Let's see what we can learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>(Appreciative though I am, I really don't understand why Helene is willing to help me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>(It doesn't even seem like she's looking at me when we talk. It's as if she's lost in her own head, searching for something else entirely...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>What's wrong, Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Oh, nothing. I was just thinking that it really might be best to try asking Ignacio for help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>...Yeah. It just might.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Haven't you sulked long enough? You fought me, and you lost. You might as well just accept it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Shut up. I'm trying to formulate a counter-strike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>If the Cursed Beast of Pride is here, that must mean he's using my magic technique, which also means there must be a control center somewhere...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>But even if we could do something about that, that still leaves the Cursed Beast itself. And since there's no Libra here, the only ace we've got up our sleeve is Emmel. But Emmel—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>You never change, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Not that it matters. I'm going to restrain you. And I'll be confiscating that Space-Time Manipulation sphere of yours, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>What's this, all of a sudden? Shahel doesn't consider me an enemy, you know. He wouldn't approve of this treatment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Well... I'm not acting on his behalf. I've personally determined that you're far too dangerous to be left to your own devices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Interesting. That's a peculiar thing to hear from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Is it, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>It is. Every single person in this Belt Region, regardless of age or gender, is an adherent to the oh-so-great Shahel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>And every last one of them mindlessly believes in the salvation he's promised, even if it leads to their own martyrdom. His every whim is entertained without a second thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Yet here you are, acting in defiance of the mighty Shahel's judgment. What a rebel you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>You know, I've always found it peculiar that you were treated as Shahel's son when you're not even of high elf blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Why does he trust you so much? Why does he hold you in such high regard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Well... H-he doesn't. He loves everyone here in equal measure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>If he should show me slightly more favor, it is purely happenstance. A mere flight of fancy on his part, perhaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>The Serpent Priest... That's what that man was called, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>What about him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>He had a son, if I'm not mistaken—a boy whose birth was foretold by the priestess of Ouroboros, upon whom a destined name was bestowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>If I remember correctly, that name was Nimu—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Shut your mouth, you senile old fool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Hah. Finally revealing your true colors, I see. Definitely a marked improvement!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>I get it, though. I do. It's hard living up to expectations—especially ones that were placed on you from the moment you were born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>I can't even imagine how disappointed your parents were when they realized you just weren't the man they'd been promised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>What are you trying to accomplish by angering me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>I'm just asking: don't you want to finally meet his expectations?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>"He Who Saved the Seven Regions and Brought Balance to the World"...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>It's not too late to fulfill that role, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>I...question the sanity of those who still believe in the so-called prophecies of some random fortuneteller from hundreds of years ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Hmph. So you do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>(He isn't aware of Bianca? Isn't she supposed to be somewhere in this Belt Region, though?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Have it your way, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>You would do well to consider your prospects, though. After all, the opportunity to change your destiny is sitting right in front of your face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>H-hey! I'm talking to you! Where do you think you're going?! You'll regret leaving me here like this, you joyless oaf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>An opportunity to change my destiny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Pure hogwash!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Good Ignacio, you seem a bit on edge. What is the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Oh, well... I-it's nothing. I just got a bit riled up by that Space-Time Manipulator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>I wouldn't take his words to heart. As I see it, he is a desperate man. He'll say and do whatever it takes if he believes it will help him realize his ambitions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>And right now, the object of those ambitions seems to be that girl, Emmel. Her importance to him is quite baffling, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>I agree. I just don't know what to make of him anymore. Perhaps I never did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>And you don't need to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>His disposition is of no concern to us. Lord Shahel's prudence alone guides us in our daily lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Speaking of, it is nearly time for milord's dinner. I must see to its preparation post-haste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Right. You can go. I need to find Emmel, anyway. She's probably with our other guest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>I will leave that matter to you, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
