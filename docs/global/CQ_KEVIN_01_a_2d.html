<td>Lady Mirianne? Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I sense a stone calling to me. If you don't mind, would you wait here for a moment, please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Mother... They finally accept me and my powers.</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Not only my magic, but my Kinetic Force too.</td>

<td>At last, I can come home with my head held high.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Training was tough, but I toughed it out because I wanted to be stronger. And it definitely helped having a great master...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>They were some of the most fulfilling days of my life. I mean, compared to the days of being treated like some underling and being told I would never amount to anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(Even if my powers are to be used for the sake of Wratharis's national interests. All as he planned.)</td>

<td>Mother... I have to go to Father now. That was the deal that was made so that I would be allowed to go into that apprenticeship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But... Should I really go to him? To that man who abandoned us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Mother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>How beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hm?</td>

<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That pendant in your hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ah, this? Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>A high quality stone. That must have been the one calling out to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Calling out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I presume that stone is an onyx. It represents both encounters and farewells. Many people carry them as a good luck charm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Please pardon me for being so forward. As a gemstone merchant, I consider it my duty to listen to the voices of these stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh, I never thought of stones having meanings, let alone voices of their own. This one just happens to be a keepsake of my mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>As far back as I can remember, Mother and I only had each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>She always had a smile on her face. They're contagious, you know? We were poor, but she always managed to make me smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>A smile is the greatest gem in this world, she said as she sold off most of her jewelry and worked her fingers down to the bone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's why I've never seen her wearing any jewelry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>And yet, she chose to give you a piece of jewelry to keep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Mother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hey! Gem lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You really shouldn't wander away from your carriage alone. You might end up getting robbed. Now hand over your valuables!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Who are all of you supposed to be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Were they following me this whole time? I had thought I'd given them the slip, but these highwaymen seem to be more tenacious than I had originally thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Highwaymen, eh? Hey, didn't you say the onyx represents encounters and farewells?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I personally prefer to avoid encounters like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Who the heck are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I must agree. I suggest we say farewell as soon as possible.</td>
