<td>001</td>
<td>It's been a while, Nina. Are you sure you're ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes! She's trained a lot and she's really strong now! If you see her in action, I'm sure you'll agree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I was surprised as well, but it's true. In addition, watching her fight showed me that she does know what she's getting herself into.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well... I mean, if Chloe is the one saying it, it's hard to deny, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What is the problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...Erm... It's hard to admit, but relations between the therians and humans are not going well. It might be hard to get people to accept a therian joining one of the knight orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It could cause...difficulties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What are you saying, Natalie?! Isn't the Scarlet Flame Guard a knight order that accepts anyone? That sees no class, background, or gender? Why would race matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We're the Scarlet Flame Guard! Something as insignificant as race shouldn't matter to us as long as a knight is willing to help us protect joy and peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So, I beg you! Let Nina join the Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I am of the same mind! Please, speak to Captain Vettel and give her a chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see. Nina, I have to be honest, since you seem set on this. You know Gerald, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Gerald is not a fan of therians, to put it lightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I am...aware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ah...but, of course, that's not the only reason we would stop you from trying to join... I just wanted to make sure you knew that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's just that he has had certain experiences...but he's really a very kind person. Honestly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I am aware of that, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh! Okay. I'm so sorry for all of this. I really do hope it all works out for you, Nina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Thank you! I hope that I can properly express the things I want to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You called me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Gerald! Um, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I should tell you that I heard almost everything. I wasn't eavesdropping. You were just too loud to ignore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hmph. It's you. That therian kid from before. Just to let you know, I don't let my personal feelings get in the way of what's best for the Guard. I am an impartial judge. If you have what it takes, then you have what it takes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Y-yessir! I'll do my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Why do you wish to join the Scarlet Flame Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I want to pay forward the good deed you did for my people when you saved us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If that is why you wish to join, you are better off just going home now. I cannot allow you to join the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Your convictions have no justice to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Justice...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Debts of gratitude, aspirations... These are shallow things. There are no knights in the Scarlet Flame Guard who do not carry both justice and conviction with them to the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So...my desire to pay your help forward is not an acceptable reason to join you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Aspirations do not save people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But...I did what you said! I trained every day! A thousand swings! Victor even said that he could sense my iron will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>"Respect none who use the sword without heart." Tell me... Once you have repaid your debt of gratitude, what do you have left? What will the purpose of your sword be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Is your conviction so weak that a simple question is enough to make you put down your sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>There is no place for someone without an iron will in the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If you truly wish to join, you must show me proof that you have the conviction to stand by your principles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>O-oh, Nina... Gerald, aren't you being a little too cold-hearted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>No. Chloe, Victor, report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Come on! You're not even giving her a chance! You haven't seen what she can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Are you willing to see her put her life on the line for such a flimsy reason? Are you willing to risk her life on the battlefield? Are you prepared to watch her die?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm telling you now that she does not have a place in the Scarlet Flame Guard until her convictions are more than just pretty words and petty, imagined debts of gratitude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Now... I will be waiting in my room. When you are prepared to do your duties, find me and give me your report on what happened at the volcano.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That Gerald... He's really not great at stuff like this. He tried, though.</td>
</tr>
