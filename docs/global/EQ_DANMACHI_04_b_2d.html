<td>I missed you so, so, so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm glad you're not hurt, Goddess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I may not be hurt, but I'm not okay, eitherâ€”I still reek of those beasts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I think there's some water nearby you could use to clean up a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hold up. Is this girl really the goddess you were talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>How rude! Can't you see my divinity just by looking at me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well, this isn't Orario, so maybe you can't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh? Goddess, do you know this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Know it? As if! All I did was chase after you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It was a different sensation than when you go down into the dungeon. Your presence felt really distant, so I wanted to make sure you were okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I went looking for you all stealthy-like, and found this weird portal right by the dungeon entrance. So I did what any sensible goddess would do: I jumped in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That sounds really dangerous, and like a generally bad idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No more dangerous than it was for you, though, right? And no more dangerous than it always is, whenever you're involved! But I couldn't very well say no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Anyway, after that, there was this girl talking about the Door of Truth or something. She seemed like she was just trying to use you, and it kind of ticked me off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>She was pretty full of herself, too, so I thought I'd take her down a peg with a few choice words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But then before I knew it, I was in the middle of this forest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, hello! If it isn't Ais Wallen-something-or-other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So you're the other person sent to help Bell, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You haven't done anything...improper with my Bell, have you? Have you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't play dumb with me, missy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ah, hahaha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Rrg! You other ladies had best back off, you hear?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>H-hey! Don't look at me. Trust me, I'm not interested.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Mm-hmm. That's what they all say. I'll be keeping a close eye on you, though, just to be sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What's your problem?! Stop staring at me!</td>
