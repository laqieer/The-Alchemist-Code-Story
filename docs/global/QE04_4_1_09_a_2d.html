<td>I absolutely loathe him...but to save Saga, I have to overcome these feelingsâ€”for Father's sake as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I know that deep down...but they just won't go away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I had no idea you felt this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Mocca, I...I can't believe I feel this way myself, either!</td>

<td>Tina...</td>

<td>We made a promise, didn't we? That we were going to protect Saga together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is the land that Asena and your father gave their lives to protect! Now it's our turn to protect it!</td>

<td>This is the land...that Asena and Father...gave their lives...to protect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't worry. I know you would never break a promise. I'm proud to call you my friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If you don't have any faith in yourself, then...put your faith in me! I would never leave your side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Mocca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We have to keep moving forward. We don't know when the dragon might start moving again. Tina, I'm going on ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm here too, you know! You should lean on us more, Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lisbeth, Mocca...thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So it's just you two, huh? Good. The battlefield's no place for a weakling like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tina's not weak at all! She'll be joining us later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So be it. Hmmm. It still hasn't moved. Shall we begin scaling the tail?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Mocca, it's starting to move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see. It's moving because it senses danger...However, if it's moving, that also means the blade can cut into it now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well spotted, Rega! We'd better start climbing before it is able to fully move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Rega, you take Kiki and Adel with you and return to the bottom. I want you to stay on standby.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We need someone to wait for the Great Sprites and Tina...just in case something happens to the rest of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If you're waiting for me, then you don't need to wait any longer. Sorry for the hold up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wind Shaman, has your hesitation been laid to rest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>For Saga's sake, I'll set aside my vendetta to defeat the dragon. I'll do it for those who have put their faith in me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We don't have time for you! Get out of our way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Remember, we're not here to cull the Jam! Reaching the dragon's back is our top priority!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's possible the dragon might start moving while we're on our way up, so stay on your guard! We're aiming for the core inside its body!</td>
