<td>Pity. They deserved salvation but were incinerated instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>It's still not enough, though. I need more magil to realize my master plan.</td>

<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>If my plan is the "flame," then these people will be the "kindling" that ignites it.</td>

<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Honestly! How can this region have so little magil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>I suppose it's due to the purification of Satna's repeated sins and the ever-decreasing population…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>I should be glad. The result is a location uniquely suited for my plan. But it's pathetic nonetheless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Queen of Wrath</td>
<td>…You mock the path my people have tread?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Afraid so. I never thought I'd see rock bottom…until now, that is. Tragic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>But have no fear. That's why I'm going to change it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>I will undo all of your mistakes--your regrets--and banish them to the ends of time.</td>

<td>…</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>…This doesn't make sense. Didn't Queen Terese join forces with the serpent to quell Satna?</td>
</tr>

<td>Easy for you to say!</td>

<td>Hang on. Is that…Andechs!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Andechs…!?</td>

<td>…*Gulp*</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Don't tell me you came here to kill us--on the eve of the calamity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Wait, wait! Now's not the time to hash this out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Right now, we need to work together to stand any chance of survival--</td>

<td>Y-You were the one...who prevented our invasion of the Invidia Belt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You were the one who quashed any chance of our survival! You damned hypocrite!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Knight of Wrath C</td>
<td>You can't fool us. You're probably responsible for the queen's disappearance, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>…Serves me right, I suppose. But you can't kill me, alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I hate to do it, but I'll force you to listen to me if I have to…</td>
