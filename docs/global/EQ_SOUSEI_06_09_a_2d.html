<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Pity. They deserved salvation but were incinerated instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's still not enough, though. I need more magil to realize my master plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If my plan is the "flame," then these people will be the "kindling" that ignites it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Honestly! How can this region have so little magil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I suppose it's due to the purification of Satna's repeated sins and the ever-decreasing population…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I should be glad. The result is a location uniquely suited for my plan. But it's pathetic nonetheless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…You mock the path my people have tread?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Afraid so. I never thought I'd see rock bottom…until now, that is. Tragic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But have no fear. That's why I'm going to change it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I will undo all of your mistakes--your regrets--and banish them to the ends of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>…Well, well. How're we feeling, partner?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why the long face? There, there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I think it's about time we get things started, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>"Space-Time Manipulation and Prototek Unification."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>"Commence forced appropriation of Satna's magil bodies."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Now then, we'll be lucky if this ends it all. The sooner, the better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Argggggh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Bloody hell…Satna has completely engulfed the city!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>At this rate, everyone who's left will…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I wonder why Satna would attack the knights of the Ira Belt in the first place…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>…This doesn't make sense. Didn't Queen Terese join forces with the serpent to quell Satna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Y-Yes… That was the plan… B-But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We were told to await orders here, in Horeb! That was it…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…So, you were their sacrificial lambs, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I see. In order to lure Satna, the city was left intact…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Despicable…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The knights assembled here to defend the capital are a mishmash of people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>They may be wearing knights' armor, but they're untrained and inexperienced…They're just average citizens…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...And to make matters worse, the "night of fire rain" has begun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's no wonder there's so much chaos--their queen is nowhere to be found.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Get it together, all of you! If you let your nerves get the better of you, you'll all wind up six feet under.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Easy for you to say!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hang on. Is that…Andechs!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Andechs…!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You abandoned us for Invidia. Why should we listen to a traitor like you!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>…*Gulp*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Don't tell me you came here to kill us--on the eve of the calamity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wait, wait! Now's not the time to hash this out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Right now, we need to work together to stand any chance of survival--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Y-You were the one...who prevented our invasion of the Invidia Belt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You were the one who quashed any chance of our survival! You damned hypocrite!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You can't fool us. You're probably responsible for the queen's disappearance, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>…Serves me right, I suppose. But you can't kill me, alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I hate to do it, but I'll force you to listen to me if I have to…</td>
