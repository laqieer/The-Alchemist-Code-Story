<td>001</td>
<td>It appears you've all gathered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Due to the expanding revolt of old Wratharis against our kingdom...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It has been decided that the Holy Guard, serving under the Holy Order of Babel, will officially step in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The Holy Guard? The strongest armed force in the entire continent? I thought they were wary of intervening in the warfare of any one kingdom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The Lizard Brigade's use of Alchemy is the primary factor behind this decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It was a decision reached in a meeting held between the Six Elders, among whose number stand the grand councilors of each kingdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It was a decision declared under the name of His Holiness, Pope Aimerlin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Pope Aimerlin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What's the matter, Dias?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, nothing. I just wanted to see if I could say his name right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh. Well, I guess Pope Aimerlin is a peculiar name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You'd better not be making jokes about His Holiness' name!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But we've never even met this Pope Aimillian...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's Pope Aimerlin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wait, isn't that what I said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You were saying "Pope Adrian."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh? I don't think that's what I said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I think it was. Or maybe it was something like Pope Silmarillion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Was his name always so elven-sounding?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What I'm trying to tell you boys is that Pope Emily deserves our respect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Emily?! Is the Pope female now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Can't we all just agree that the Pope's name is hard to pronounce?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You're the one who started all of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Pope Aime... Aireme... Ai... How about we just go with Pope Amy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Amy! That works! It's easy to remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Amy?! Are you serious?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well... Maybe it doesn't really fit the bill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Amy... Hehehehe! Such a pretty name! Hahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>How is that funny?! I don't understand what gets you going anymore, Father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>This should get Agatha smiling again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>D-do you really think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Enough! Your jokes from earlier were bad enough, and all this stuff about the Pope's name isn't any better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I can't have you bringing filth to Agatha's ears anymore! I'm gonna stab you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Don't stab father over this! This is exactly why people call you Headstrong Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Stop calling me that! Let me stab him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Just wait until Episode 5! You'll get to stab him in Episode 5!</td>
