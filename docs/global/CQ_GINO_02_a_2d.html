<td>Hyaaah!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ugh…! Ow…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, yikes… I got carried away. Are you alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hmph! Just a scratch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wait, that was a little deep. If you're injured…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh? If I'm taken down by a little injury like this, how could I become a real knight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't apologize for hurting me. It's better to get hurt and endure the pain for battle…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Heh… I thought you were just a spoiled brat, but you have confidence in yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm not apologizing for being a brat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Idiot, I'm complimenting you. And your skills with the sword are fairly good. That made me go at you stronger than I should have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, just a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>W-wait… Once more! I'll promise to give it my all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hey, Victor! That looked a bit too strong there. Hold yourself back! They're still just cadets, remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Uh oh… the commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're quite impressive, young man. To be able to move like that…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>He is the shining star of the boarding school. He happens to be Fraise's younger brother…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>F-Fraise's younger brother?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see now. Excellence in brotherhood, as it stands. I'm looking forward to things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>For real…? You're his brother…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There was a rumor that his younger brother was at the boarding school. I should've known it was you by the way you moved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Jeez… Even this guy won't shut up about him…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, let's forget about him. Shall we do another round?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hm? Hey Gino. What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Enough. I'm not in the mood anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It frustrates me. Everyone always talks about him to me…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Even if I do my best, they say "Because you're Fraise's brother." If I do something bad they say "But you're Fraise's brother." I'm sick of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Gino…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So what if I'm his brother? If I'm strong it has nothing to do with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You're really bothered by it. But it seems you're the one that's the most concerned by it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Wha…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I don't recall ever saying or thinking "Because he's the younger brother…"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>In addition, if you really wanted to become a knight, you shouldn't care about that and think of more important things, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Alright! That's it for today's training session. Gather round!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh, already finished for today. Let's go then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Think of more important things...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hmph! Hyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Fraise, you're still training?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yeah. If I train hard, I can become a proud knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Once I become a strong and powerful knight, we can live peacefully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We don't have to rely on others and live life freely together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Plus, as a knight I can protect many people as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>If I do that, we'll never lose anyone else, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Brother…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hyah! Hyaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Tsk… Still not satisfied at all…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>"Excellence in brotherhood?" What is that supposed to mean? Does not make things easier at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hm? What was that sound?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>P-please! Please let me go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>…?! Someone's voice…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>P-please! Spare my life! I have a young child…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Shut up! Like we care!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Those are…the bandits that the instructor was talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Perfect. I can take those guys on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>A knight must protect the people. I must protect that man…and use my skills to help him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'm destined to become a knight. And to be a stronger one than him…</td>
</tr>
