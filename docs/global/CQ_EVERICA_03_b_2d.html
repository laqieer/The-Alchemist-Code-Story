<td>Tch...! They're tough!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>How are all our men being pushed back by just two fighters!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'll tell you how! We're partners. And when we're together...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...we never lose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hiya!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Nuh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Damn yooooou!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...I thought you'd try something like that. But I won't let you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Are you ok?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Of course. After all, I've got you here with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I know I could count on you. You've always got my back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Come on, now isn't the time for... Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hazel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I've gotten pretty used to these limbs. Now I can fight. Thanks for the help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But why... Why did you come back to battle after you were so badly hurt? </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You lost half of your body! You could have died!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Because I made up my mind, back when I first became a mercenary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But...aren't you afraid? Even just standing here like this, I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Then why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Because what I'm even more afraid of is being unable to protect my friend. That's why...I'm really glad you're ok.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...It's getting dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...Yeah, it really is. And the clouds are so thick that they're starting to cloud my mood too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...But just beyond the clouds, there's a beautiful moon waiting. It's like how...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Even though I lost my limbs, I could still return to the battlefield. As long as you don't give up, hope will never disappear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...You really are strong, Hazel. I wish I had that kind of strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I can't see the moon beyond the clouds, but... I want to believe that it's there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...Once the clouds clear, I'd really like to look upon that moon with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...Yeah. I know we will eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>By the way...why did you choose me to be your partner?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You don't know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No. After all, I'm still in training. And you said I had a keen eye for battle, but it wound up being no good...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That's not true. Just from the enemies' footsteps you were able to discern their direction and number, and then figure out how to deal with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Not to mention, you were also the one who realized they were hiding in that cave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You really do have a good eye for battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>And you always take me into account with your plans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Do you remember? Back on that mission when I got hurt, you had a bad feeling about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We might be able to take them out with a pincer attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Get 'em with their backs to the wall, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's right. There are too many enemies as they are now. But if we split up and take them out individually, we might stand a chance...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...What? Having second thoughts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's just, in a situation like this, splitting up might be too dangerous an idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Don't worry. I'll be the one to force them back. I know we can do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yeah...you're right. Just, don't get in over your head, ok?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You realized the danger, but I went for it anyway and got in over my head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It was my inexperience that caused these injuries, not yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>But I could have done something. I could have stopped you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's what I'm talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You're always thinking of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You know, back when we made that plan, I was thinking of you too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You mean... You were doing the same thing I was?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yep. That's why I wanted you to be my partner, because we're so much alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hazel...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>We don't do well on our own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>We need each other. And now that I've got these prosthetics, I need you more than ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...You're right. I shouldn't be wasting time feeling sorry for myself. I should be thinking about how we can best fight together with your new body!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Partners are equals... They play to each other's strengths while covering each other's weaknesses, like two parts of a whole. Isn't that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...More of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>They don't give up, do they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Uwaaaaa!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>TAAAAaaaa!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>UUUOOoooo!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>NUAAAHH----!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hey, Evelika, what do you say after this mission, we go get some cheese dogs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...Haven't you been eating too many cheese dogs lately?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You definitely have! But...maybe just this once, we can buy a whole bunch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>...I made you worry about me, so this time it's my treat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Wait, really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Yep! But we've got to get home safely first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Yeah...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>(No matter how many enemies there are--no matter how bad it gets--it'll be ok in the end.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Because we're two people who share an unbreakable bond of trust. Because we're partners!</td>
</tr>
