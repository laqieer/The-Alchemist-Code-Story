<td>Wait! I haven't finished with you yet! Why do you know the secret of Agatha's origin?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Honestly... How am I supposed to be the grand councilor for a kingdom, if I cannot even perceive something so obvious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Listen, Dias... Nothing remains hidden from me. Remember that well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Noticing that Gabirond's gaze is directed towards his right arm, Dias quickly hides it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I-in any case, why do you believe that taking Agatha in as his daughter is proof that he regrets the sins from his past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's because he regards Agatha as the object of penance for his own sins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>By raising a child of Wratharis, he must have thought it would lead to atonement towards the people he massacred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>To explain it plainly...Captain Zeke may have predicted that events would unfold in this manner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wh-what do you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I mean that Captain Zeke could have raised Agatha for this very purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>To position Agatha, whose lineage is that of Wratharis blood, as the representative to establish a dominion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He may have done so to escape the suffering he felt regarding his own sins, or...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>In any case, I pity Agatha who was raised without knowing the ulterior motives of his love...ugh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You speak too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ugh...! Wh-what are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>My father is not that kind of man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>He raised us with the same amount of love he gave to Logi...even though we weren't his real children!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I will not allow you to insult my father any further!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Le-let me...go! It...hurts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Agh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>As the pain increases in his right arm, Dias involuntarily relaxes his hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Then, he brushes Gabirond aside and walks off on his own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Cough...cough! Y-you...where do you think you're going?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Where do you think? I'm going to confirm my father's true intentions. There is nothing that is more important right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ack... That brat...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yet...slowly, his beliefs are beginning to sway.</td>
