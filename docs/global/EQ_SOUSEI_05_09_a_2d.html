<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm in...my room?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Lady Nicaea! You're awake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Emmel? Have you been nursing me back to health?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Don't worry about it! That was my decision to do so. How are you feeling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I feel well. I suspect that it's thanks entirely to your generosity in using your powers to help me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm glad to hear that. However, I'm afraid that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh... Selsieg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm so sorry... My Spiritbonding seems to be ineffective on sacred beasts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's okay. There's nothing you can do about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There's already little left of Selsieg's true form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Every time its power gets used, its existence thins a little more... I fear that is its fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...I wish I could've granted them a more peaceful way to spend their final days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lady Nicaea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I shouldn't complain. I truly am grateful to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We wouldn't have been able to prevail against the Ira soldiers nor the Cursed Beast without your aid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Even despite that, there must be something that we can do for you in return. Don't be shy about asking, okay? That's the least we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...My ability to heal using Spiritbonding really isn't as good as it used to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Is it because I lost against the Cursed Beast that time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Or...because I'm no longer receiving Sephiron's blessing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Seriously, Emmel, I keep telling you not to overdo it if you want to get better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You haven't fully recovered yet! If you want to get your strength back, you've got to have some proper rest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Eulalia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I just can't ignore the wounded...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But I'm relieved. It looks like Lady Nicaea and the knights have not given up yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Of course! They're doing their best to survive, no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Humans are able to get up again, no matter what kind of despair knocks them down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...Humans really are strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hey, Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I've been thinking about this for a while, but this whole feeble attitude isn't working.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The whole negative outlook towards living beings, and all the giving up just a little bit too quickly? You get what I'm saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You're going to cause a misunderstanding if you keep acting like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>"The real you isn't like this."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Eulalia, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...I knew it, some of the corruption still remains.</td>
</tr>
