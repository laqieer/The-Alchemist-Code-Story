<td>Tsk. Looks like it wasn't enough.</td>

<td>Well, live and learn. Come now, children, it's time to get out of here!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What? How do you expect to get out of here?!</td>

<td>Hah! It's been in hibernation for quite some time. I would say it's more likely that it's gone a little cuckoo.</td>

<td>Its perception is no good. It's mistaking the fire for the warmth of people.</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Cuckoo? Warmth? What—?</td>

<td>Pull yourselves together, fools! Barely smart enough to run away with your tails between your legs... The Cursed Beast covets the heat of the ship! If we leave this place, it will not follow!</td>

<td>Nimul, perhaps we should heed this woman's words and follow her.</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes, that shouldn't be a problem.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's only polite that you introduce yourselves first, don't you think? I did just save your lives.</td>

<td>I apologize. I was brought here from the Gula Belt Region of Gluttony, and I am called Nimul.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So I do know who you are. Well, I know of you, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Thank you for sharing your names with me. Allow me to introduce myself in return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I am a witch. The name I once had has already been lost to time. I go by a new name now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I am the Ambrosia, the Abstinent Witch.</td>
