<td>Well met, Protector. We have been waiting for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The Collectors of Wisdom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Where is Ceclidis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Our goal is to perform the resurrection ceremony, to return this world to the days of warmth and goodness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Knowing that, do you really need me to tell you where he has gone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The arboreal altar! Still, without a druidic priestess—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No, even with a priestess, it is too late. All that is left of the great tree Sephiron is the corruption that destroyed it. Whatever you hope to accomplish by attempting to reawaken it, your efforts will all be for naught!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmph. So even you hadn't realized. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>After all, you seem determined to be Sephiron's Protector until the bitter end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What are you trying to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes, the great Sephiron as we once knew it is gone! The blessings of the Tree of Life have withered away, and we have been left bereft of the paradise that it once gave us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And yet not all has been lost! O Mother Sephiron, you have not forsaken us! You left one last thing behind, knowing that the chosen ones would see it for the blessing it truly is. The potential to raise a new Sephiron—a Tree of Calamity!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Cryphone! We throw ourselves at your feet in supplication! Draw your power from us, and be born anew!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The curse of the Sacred Stone, which has taken root within Ceclidis, and a druidic priestess... These two things are all that is needed for Cryphone to sprout upon the carcass of Sephiron!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Do you understand now, Protector? The Sephira are no more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It is time for a new world order! Cryphone, raise your fallen people to our rightful place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Cast down these grasping remnants of the past! This is the end for you, Protector of Sephiron!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No!</td>
