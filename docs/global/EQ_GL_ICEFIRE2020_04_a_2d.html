<td>The hydra flails its elongated necks, aggressively snapping and tossing the adventurers with seemingly no effort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ugh! What the...! How is the hydra this strong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We told you boss! We told you! How are we even going to escape from this mess now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...Foxes! Help... party!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>With one swift move, Eira and her foxes conjure a speed spell to move the party away to safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh! More power my foot! Can't even beat a hydra with three enchanted humans and one foxgirl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...all... safe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes, thank you Eira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We're alright. Boss, we should really thank Eira, we were pretty much kaput before she-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Enough! We need to go back to that smug elf and demand answers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Elf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Back so soon? Have you slain-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm going to stop you right there. Clearly, you were just messing with us. We get it, hilarious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Now, how about, you hand over the remaining power and we can actually go slay the hydra?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>With the power i've imbued into your party, it would be enough to take the hydra down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Failing to do so simply means that you lack in technique and experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm afraid I will have to reject your request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...no...fighting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Okay, okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see what's happening yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Pretending to give us all the power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...when all along you've been giving this runt the magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It does feel that way, now that the boss spelled it out...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Your leap of logic is impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>In any case, it appears you'd rather settle this with combat instead of coming to an understanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, I DO understand what's going on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You're going to regret this!</td>
