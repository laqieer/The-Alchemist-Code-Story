<td>...Hm. I can see why they call him "the wizard of the land of machinery." These prosthetics aren't half bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I guess I can't expect to master them right from the start, but with a bit more use, I think I'll get used to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hazel...why did you follow me here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What do you mean "why"? Because we're partners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But...I failed you. I failed my partner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What happened to you was because of me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's not how it is Evelika...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>And now because of me, you're here on the battlefield even though you're still getting used to your new limbs. I'm just causing problems again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Evelika</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The two of us made that plan together. What happened to me wasn't your fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Look, there they are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We've got company!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What's the enemy's position? Can you tell?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Judging from their footsteps...the enemy is at 6 o'clock. There are a great deal of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Trying to surround us, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No...in this terrain, they're probably trying to drive us back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Think we can break through?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, it's not impossible, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(Hazel seems to be handling her prosthetics well, but I'm worried about her physical strength.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(If we're going to break up the enemy and take them out individually, the closest place to do that would be...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We need to lure them into that cave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Alright, let's do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh? What are you laughing about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's just, you seem like the old Evelika again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hazel...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Anyway, we've gotta hurry. You go ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>There! You're dead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We don't have time to argue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...Ah, ok! I'll head for the cave!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...Right. I'm counting on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(She's what?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Gah...!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hazel! Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>HAAAAA!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hiya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Nyah...!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Nice one, Hazel! Are your prosthetics ok?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>They're fine! Get to the cave!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(How... How can she say she trusts me...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(Like I'm still her...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hazel, I'm almost to the entrance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(Wait, is that light...coming from inside the cave?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That's it! Hazel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Can you block the cave entrance!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Haa!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Damn! They saw through our ambush! Get out there, quick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>We're just gonna have to overpower 'em!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Evelika, they're heading your way! Let's meet 'em head on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Right!</td>
