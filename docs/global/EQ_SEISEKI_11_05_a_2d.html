<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>S-so fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>My, my, but we're just getting started! Why don't we just have a little fun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Neun, Acht...I appreciate you lending a hand, but I would prefer if you didn't interfere with my battle with Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Tsk. Our job isn't to settle petty feuds, but to destroy everyone on site, not just that one guy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>She disappeared?! Lord Zahar, watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What...? Look out behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The one here with the highest fighting ability is that silver-haired man. I shall destroy the girl, the one he cares for, in order to distract him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I suspect that will be the most effective method of destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Wow! How unusual for the two of us to agree on something! Let's just get right to it then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I don't need you to tell me what I already know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh no! Spica! Run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Umph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>L-Lord Zahar...? No... Noooooooo!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well. I had not expected my plan to go this well. It falls outside of my projections that you would use your own body to protect the girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This saves me some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Urgh... This mindless, faithless violence that swarms upon any that it comes across...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hmph. This is exactly the kind of thing a fool like you would resort to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This isn't how I was hoping this would end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>However, this only came about because of your own choice to save that girl. Clearly, you are not nearly as cold-hearted as you pretend to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ha! Is that what you saw with your pitiful eyes? That I saved a simple girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I did not save a mere girl. I saved someone who will inherit the future, who will carry what I have taught her forward and carve it into the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Someone like you who cannot see past the surface of things could never understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Lord Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Spica... You must revive the Shadow Messiah, not just for those who need it, but to rid the world of destructive fools like these!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Spica, no! After all you've been through, don't waste it all by falling into old patterns now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Urgh! You, girl... You must...learn to discern what true justice is. The empty justice of the Holy Guard cannot be allowed to prevail over all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That is exactly what has brought this world to ruin! You, Lord Commander... You have no right to preside over what justice can truly be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Our justice isn't empty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Fools, all of you... Y-you must have realized by now... The justice you espouse, it doesn't take into account the capacity for darkness each person carries...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's just pretty words with no room for reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The capacity for darkness...people carry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Where there is light, there is darkness... The hearts of people are the same way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>By eliminating that darkness from your ideas of justice, you act as if it doesn't exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>As a result, you fail to take into account the full range of human experience...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Y-you who cannot believe in people have no right to determine the justice that they live by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We don't...believe in people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It's because you seek to suppress it that the power of darkness grows... I believe in a different system. One which makes use of the power of darkness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>One in which the darkness in all of our hearts...can be seen and understood... That is the only way to achieve true peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That is the true justice that the Shadow Messiah strives for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ugh. Talkative for a dead man, isn't he? How long are you going to let him run his mouth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I never had any intention of "letting" him do anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Whatever. Do you mind if we take care of this girl now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Where do you think you're going? Did you not hear me when I said I was here for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Don't you feel special? I'll make it quick and painless, just for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Agh...ahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hrrrgh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Oh. You're still alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I told you...fools like you...could never...defeat me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You must have known that to come to this girl's aid would be tantamount to suicide, and yet you did so regardless... There is something to be said for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Ha...haha... This body is just the temporary form...that I need to exist in this world... What is one life...in comparison to the greater good?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Even if my body dies...my beliefs will not! I suppose fools such as you—who value nothing—could not understand such a thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Do not forget this... There will come a day...when you will find yourselves...crushed...beneath the heel...of fate, and...it will be at the hand...of one who carries my beliefs...in their heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'll wait in anticipation of that day. Now... Goodbye, Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Lord Zahar!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Dragon Pyromancer!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>He was attacked...?! Who—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>This presence...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Who are you? Your aura seems somehow similar to Zahar's darkness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I didn't plan to interfere, but it's a little too much for me to just stand by and watch as someone turns their weapons against defenseless women.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>So...it is you...after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You thought you got away from me, didn't you, Zahar? Hm... What is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>For you to protect that girl...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>C-Captain Cadanova! Is that you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Ah, Kanon. Have you become the Lord Commander after all? You've come a long way from the scrappy underdog of a knight that you once were. I am proud of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Argh... H-how did you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>How do you think? The same way you did, of course. I slipped back into this world just before the bridge between worlds closed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>What? Did you think I would simply let someone as dangerous as you into the world without supervision?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Urgh! Will you never leave me be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Leave you be...? You don't seem to understand the situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I am not here to get in your way. I am here to end you, once and for all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Urgh... You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>C-Captain Cadanova, please! Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Stay back, Kanon! He may be injured, but Zahar is still a very dangerous individual!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Captain, please listen! That man... That man is not our enemy right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What are you saying, Kanon?! Zahar is the one who has turned against this world. Don't tell me that even you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Hmph. There is no end to the surprises today, is there? Cadanova, the Flame Dragon King... You are the last person I thought I would encounter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>And, of all things, we share the same goal! Perhaps, in this case, the enemy of my enemy can be my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>My comrades and I are here to take the life of Zahar and that girl over there. As long as you don't have a problem with that, we don't have a problem with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Hm... And who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>We are the Veda Templars. Our mission is to ensure that justice is served in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I'm sure you have questions, but should your first priority not be Zahar? After all, he is the reason you have so painstakingly made your way here, is he not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Wha—?! Captain Cadanova!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Indeed. Zahar gained unimaginable strength in that world of darkness, strength which I cannot allow to exist in this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Wait! Please, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>It's too late... Cadanova would never...let a chance like this go. Haha... The chance of a lifetime...right, Cadanova?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Hmph. It seems you've made your peace with the situation. Cadanova, I can take care of this if you simply stay out of my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>S-Spica... Go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>What are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>H-how many times will you force me to say it...? You are the future...of the Shadow Messiah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Are you...disobeying my...direct...order?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Haha... Just thinking about it...makes me laugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>The image of these fools being sent to hell, thanks to a battalion led by you, Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Lord...Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Will you take that...from me now? In my...last moments?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Go, Spica! Live, so that...you...can show them...the meaning of death!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Are your last words finally coming to an end, Zahar? It's time for you to return to hell, old friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Lord Zahar! No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Wha...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>What do you think you're doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I think I must have said something along the lines of this to Kanon...but I believe that there's a kind of heart that determines victory and defeat on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>And...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>It's difficult to understand... Honestly, even I cannot explain myself. I cannot explain it, except that seeing Zahar like this has forced me to reconsider where I stand in this moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>We share the same goal, supposedly... Yet I find myself unable to bear witness to this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>In other words, our temporary alliance has been cut short.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>That cold intent in your eyes... It seems I made the correct choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Cadanova... You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Hmph. Don't read too much into this. It seems that we have a greater enemy, one whom we need to face together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>You are the enemy of my enemy. That means that we are allies...for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Y-you...! How dare you...steal...what I was going to say? I only hope that you...do not slow me down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Hmph... This day has been...full of unexpected twists.</td>
</tr>
