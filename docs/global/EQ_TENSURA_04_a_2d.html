<td>...Seriously? That girl was brought here, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ah, don't worry about it. Let's leave that for later...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(I knew it. It really is the Orc Lord... And he's headed straight for this village.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Everyone, listen up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>From a different point on the timeline, huh? What a complicated situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Agreed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So basically, these guys were plucked from the time where we were still fighting them, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yeah. In other words, it's the same orcs that later became our friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This is tough... I can't think of a way to settle this without fighting them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(I'd rather find a way to save them all and return to our world together...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Answer: Taking back orcs that have ingested large quantities of Alchemia will have strong adverse effects on our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Benimaru, evacuate the villagers to a safe place together with Creto.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We'll keep in contact via Thought Communication when the orcs arrive. Get back as soon as the villagers are in a safe place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Got it. Are you going to be okay by yourself? You're still not back at full power yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I can hold them off until you guys return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Besides, I want to make sure that not a single one of these kind villagers dies at their hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I don't want to saddle the orcs with more sins for them to regret when they come back to their senses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yikes. That's over 200,000 of them! I'm glad I ordered the others to evacuate the village first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey! You there! Listen up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I don't want to fight you! I want to find a way to return to our world together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>So please, stop eating and listen to me! We can still find a way to save you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Did they hear me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hunger...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I knew it. No luck there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(So it's exactly as Ouroboros said then...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That will be impossible. They've already devoured and absorbed too much Alchemia from this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Taking them back with you would bode ill for your world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Answer: Taking back orcs that have ingested large quantities of Alchemia will have strong adverse effects on our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...Guess fighting is our only option left. I just have to hold out till Benimaru and the others return. Huh? Wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(They already absorbed too much Alchemia... Is that the only problem? Because if that's the case...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Albea?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Were you planning to take on all of these orcs by yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Well, at least slow them down, maybe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Aren't you putting yourself in a lot of danger?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I guess, but this is just one of my responsibilities as the ruler of the Jura Tempest Federation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Besides, I just had a great idea. So leave this to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...Show-off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh! Show-off?! You mean cool, right?! You wanted to say cool?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No, I meant show-off. Someone who doesn't even consider the feelings of the ones he left behind and just runs off by himself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It frustrates me, since it reminds me of the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>However, I understand why some people choose to do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>So I've decided to join you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Albea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The strength of our prey is our own! The strength of our prey is our own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Haaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ngh! Their power is overwhelming! At this rate, we'llâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Albea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hell Flare!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Looks like we got here just in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Benimaru! You've recovered enough to use Hell Flare again? Nice going! I knew you could do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>All these battles have taught me how to manipulate Alchemia. I'm finally getting the hang of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The villagers are safe, so all that's left is dealing with these guys. Let's do this!</td>
