<td>Oh, Agatha.<br>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Please just listen to me! Logi and Dias won't stop babbling about their battle! Even if it was their first battle, too much is too much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>W-what's the big problem? We did such a good job that His Majesty even congratulated us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't you agree, Dias?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes, with just the two of us, we defeated Vlad the Thunderer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yeah, alright! You already told me that a thousand times! The stew is going to get cold, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Heh... Let me take the time to listen to your stories after we eat, so we can first enjoy a warm meal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Alright...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Enjoy the meal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sure.</td>

<td>Father?<br>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, it's just that...<br>You have all really grown up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Father! We've grown up so much that we managed to defeat Vlad the Thunderer! Isn't that right, Dias?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh, come on! Didn't you agree to keep that for after the meal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No second servings for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What?! Come on...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And neither for you, Dias!</td>

<td>022</td>
<td>(It's all thanks to that day, that I earned such a lovely family around me, even after being called the Blood Wolf.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(That innocent smile...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(And these kids took a big step towards a world where Agatha can keep on smiling.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(A world where these kids can live with a smile on their face. That is the peace I want to achieve.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(And for that... I cannot allow myself to forget about my sins as the Blood Wolf.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Father? Don't you like the stew?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh, sorry, sorry! How could I ever dislike your stew, Agatha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Don't you agree, guys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I agree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Right, Agatha's stew is really the best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Praising me like that isn't going to get you a second serving!</td>

<td>This one man who sealed the flame of envy in his heart to bring about a peaceful world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Though continuing to bear his past sins, this man's unwavering will was inherited by his family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The gears of destiny which this man had set in motion, continued shaping people's lives until this day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What may the future hold? A peaceful world filled with laughter, or one filled with sorrow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The answer to that question lays dormant in the unknown future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huh?! Where am I? What on earth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Heh... I see. Who would have thought that I'd ever be transmuted, after all my efforts of sealing Alchemy away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well, I suppose I can't help it.<br>This is part of destiny as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If for a strong spirit who aims for peace, who doesn't get swayed by power, I could lend my strength.</td>
