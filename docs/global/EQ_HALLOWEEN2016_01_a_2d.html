<td>Wow! This town has completely embraced Halloween!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Jeez. Remind me why I was dragged into a mission like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Last night, I won big time at the casino, and I couldn't find the right timing to cash in. Thanks to that, I haven't slept at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Magnus? You were transmuted for this mission, and you went to a casino? I can't believe you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Can you blame me? Gambling is way more fun than missions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But it's Halloween! Don't you like sweets? The excitement is contagious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey now, if you get swept away in all the festivity, you're gonna get hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Our mission isn't just to pass out sweets but to keep a look out as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But look at my beautiful costume! Yours suits you as well, Magnus. We're just gonna be passing out candy, so let's try to enjoy it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Look... I'm just trying to blend into my surroundings. Do you think I'd wear something like this if it weren't for the mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Aww, but it looks good on you. Don't you think so, Woody?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Jeez...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That said, with the streets crowded with people in costumes, it's gonna be a hassle to pass out candy just to the children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah. There are a lot of people who I'm unsure as to whether they're children or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This is a seriously tedious mission. I want to hurry back home and sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Exactly! I won't allow anyone to ruin such an exciting festival! Let's do our best, Magnus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...Se-seriously? (Was she even listening to what I said?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh no! Someone in a costume is going on a rampage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>A rampage! Are they drunk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Let's find out!</td>
