<td>Are you okay, Malta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Y-yeah, I'm okay. I suddenly just realized how exhausted I am, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If you say so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Tell me if you need anything! I promised Kamui that I'd protect you, remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>O-of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(During the ceremony, I realized something while I was connected to Sephiron.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(The great tree does not have long. In addition, I can sense that someone is at the altar doing something to Sephiron.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(I have to do something to stop this before something terrible happens.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I have to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Are you one of the village survivors?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Is that...Miss Teona?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hisham?! Thank goodness you're okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You are...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>She's a gladiator from the royal capital! She's the champion of the Arena, so she's really strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hello. I am Teona, and you are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh no! There seems to be a skirmish nearby, so come with me! Other survivors are headed this way as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Awesome! We'll be safe with Miss Teona!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I-is everything okay, Miss Teona? Why are you smiling like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh, it's just that I'm happy you were able to find yourself a family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yeah! Malta and Kamui, and even Isidore...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>They're all my family now! Teona, do you think...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Of course! We'll make sure everybody gets out of this alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hisham, do you mind going ahead without us? I have to speak with this person privately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh? B-but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't worry, Hisham. I'll keep her safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>All right, but catch up soon, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Do you intend to get yourself killed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What? No! What makes you say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm sorry for being so direct. It is just that I've seen that face you're making on many people I never saw alive again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I don't intend to die, really. It's just that there is something I must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Very well, then I'll be coming with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh? B-but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I've been in this army as sort of a commando, so sudden changes to where I'm headed help to confuse the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Besides, Hisham has finally found people he could call family and I promised that he'd make it out with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You can thank me when the war is over. For now, let's just live through this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We were lucky enough to make it to Sephiron, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I really didn't expect that the soldiers of the Royal Army would come all the way here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Lord Waginau, it seems your assumptions were correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Then it is clear what Ceclidis plans to do. He intends to summon Cryphone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Cryphone...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Sephiron is the light of this world, and where there is light, there will always be shadow. Cryphone is that shadow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Shadow... Do you mean the darkness that is said to be within Sephiron?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Exactly. Cryphone is the darkness that reaches out from Sephiron, which causes some to turn to evil acts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What could Ceclidis possibly gain from this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No matter how great a source of power may be, if that power cannot be controlled, it will only bring disaster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>He must have prepared accordingly. The stone he carries must be—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>How astute of you, Lord Waginau. We should have expected you to see through our ploy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>These warriors... Are they not the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Stay sharp, Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Lord Waginau... No. You do not deserve the respect that title affords. Waginau! You eluded us once, but never again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Your life ends here!</td>
</tr>
