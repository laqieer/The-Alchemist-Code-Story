<td>O storm...release thy true form now! ...Everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Thank you, Tamis! Tina, now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Rega, together now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Leave it to me...here we go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaahhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>......!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...We did it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Thank you, Rega. If you weren't here, who knows what would've happened...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Heheh. I'm glad you're all okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hold on...you have the power of the wind?! What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I didn't have time to show you my power last time we met. Let me reintroduce myself: I'm Rega, a Tehre-born Wind Shaman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That means that a Wind Shaman exists for each of the three factions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Exactly! Well, last time, Tehre told me I wasn't supposed to tell you guys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But I already knew about it! Tehre told me that you two were Wind Shamans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...That's why I wanted to be your friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What are you doing here, Rega? How did you know we were here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tehre told me to help you out if things got too bad...since I have the power of the wind like you guys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I see! You know...it's impressive how strong your wind is for someone your age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Asena...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What a sacred wind...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But...it's so...weak...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Even I can feel it. Asena's power has been consumed to the point that...the Godwolf is barely managing to stand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Is this the price for suppressing the power of Beelzebub?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No. You are aware of nothing. You burden nature in order to sustain your existence. You've abandoned the responsibility of living by your own hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You do not see that this current situation is a result of your over-reliance on Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We...really were relying too much on Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We've been living blissfully...while Asena has shouldered our burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>How foolish we've been. We had to witness it to realize!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We...were aware of nothing. Tehre was right about everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I believe...Asena must be released...for the sake of Saga's future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I better understand now...what Tehre was talking about. We should release Asena...from this burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Asena...I'm truly sorry. We took too long to realize just how heavy the burden you carry is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Please forgive us for having to see it with our own eyes before truly realizing. We promise to restore the balance of nature...at all costs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We will return Saga to a land where humans and nature can co-exist in peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We will restore the Wind Matter and save you, Asena!</td>
