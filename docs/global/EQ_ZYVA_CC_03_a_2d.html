<td>I can see colors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>You are a poet, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Ahahah! And you are an idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Yes, yes. Concentrate, if you please. One, two, three...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Ahh! W-wait, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>I was being serious, you know! I can see colors. Kind of like auras. Sometimes they're faint, sometimes they're really vivid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Walk in a straight line. Your center of gravity should be tipped slightly forward, so that you glide smoothly across the floor. Now, one, two, three...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Hey! Giudecca! Don't you believe me? It's true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Un, deux, trois...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>You're still counting! Aaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>We must do something about that ungainly stride of yours as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Just let me walk how I want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>You are lacking refinement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Shut it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>What did I just tell you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Shut up! I'm sick of you. You're a stupid idiot! A loopy loon! Beh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>You are far from dazzling yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Iris... I wonder if this color perception of yours is a form of synesthesia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>What the hell is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>You mustn't talk so roughly. Try something like this: "What exactly is that, sir?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Wh-what's that, actually, um...sir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Really? You couldn't manage to string a simple sentence together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Urghh! I'm so sick of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Synesthesia is a unique sensory condition which causes one to perceive the Alchemia emitted by voices, personalities, figures, and so on as colors. It is incredibly rare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Sometimes the colors change depending on the person's mood... I like it. It's kinda interesting, and pretty to look at.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>What color am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Same as my old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>You mustn't like me very much, then. Also, do not make me repeat myself. You must mind your speech.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Sir Giudecca, you are very the same hue as the pile of human excrement that was my father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Can you identify lies and forgeries by color as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>It's not some kinda all-powerful superpower. Parts of me get mixed in as well, complicating things...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>There're plenty of things I can't see. Things that are buried deep inside, complex emotions and intent—not all evil is blatant, y'know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>That's how I ended up like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>A real mess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Reporting on Iris' training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>I don't recall asking you to do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>You are going to need more fighting power if you are to make it through the Mystic Tower Veda, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>That doesn't mean I'm taking on just any old street rat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>We've got a samurai on board now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>I heard that you were spurned by the king of Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>It's not the first time. Kings, like cats, are fickle beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>I assure you that I am going to succeed here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>I don't want to be subjected to every minor detail of your training routine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>It will be a long and gradual process that will yield appropriately steadfast results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Are those twin blades of yours merely ornamental?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Yeah! They are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>So, first and foremost they are for show. Two specialized weapons, whose surreal, slashing movements confound the eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Even hopelessly outnumbered, the angle of the range of your control will be expansive, and the breadth of your tactics will be wide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Two is stronger than one! Everyone knows that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>On the contrary, dual-wielded blades are only half as powerful as a two-handed weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>The weight of your blades is too much for your fragile frame. They carry your movements, when it ought to be the other way around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Strike firm and true. Pierce one of the body's vital points with a single hit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>C'mere...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>If one of your blades is stopped, you must immediately strike with the other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Aaaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>There is much you will need to learn if you are to survive in Lost Blue and carry out your assassination missions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Your skill with those blades is perhaps most important of all. They cannot afford to be crude, even if your demeanor can. You will need to master the use of each of your arms; that is surely our greatest problem to surmount.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>All right, already! I get it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>However, you ought to know that there is charm in discipline, in technique. Ceaseless, cutting slashes, a graceful sword dance; the elegant, rolling movements of the body as it deflects attacks, the flash left in your blades' wake...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Yes, romance abounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Huh? What's romance got to do with anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Once we are done, you will be dazzling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Assuming I have not misjudged you, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>You know what? I'm starting to get excited about all this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>She is scrubbing up nicely, and surprisingly quickly, too. I expect she was an excellent thief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>You're not really a good example for her to follow, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>How rude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Used to dealing with sprightly types, are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Very much so. I had to deal with many of the royal line when I was in the Imperial Elite Guard. Hence why I know a thing or two about etiquette and comportment...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>In addition to combat training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Combat training?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>The kind that works every muscle in the human body to a fine point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>I almost feel sorry for the poor girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Heh. She's very good at stealing things, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>This is the first thing I ever stole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>A bottle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Just look at all the gems inside it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>I didn't know you fancied such trifles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>H-hey! What're you trying to say?! I never said anything like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>(Hm. I enjoy this...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>I was just a little girl, you know, living with a band of thieves. They found out I'd pinched this from our loot stash, but I begged my old man to let me keep it, and he did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Hmm...do I detect amber?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Aren't they pretty? They were my greatest treasure. They always gleamed like pure gold to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Not anymore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Well...they still do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><img src="../img/backgrounds/bg07.png" alt="bg07"></td></tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Dad! I want this! It's all gold and sparkly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Just like your eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><img src="../img/backgrounds/bg10.png" alt="bg10"></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>I can't help but stare at them. It's sort of...part of my daily routine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Wh-what the heck?! Why're you so close?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Because I chose to move closer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>What're you lookin' at?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>It's very sad, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><img src="../img/backgrounds/black.png" alt="black"></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Would you be so kind as to go on an errand for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><img src="../img/backgrounds/bg113.png" alt="bg113"></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>It's time for a history lesson.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Boo--!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Regarding the decline of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Who gives a stuff about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>The coincidence of the nation's defeat at the Battle of Gilrack and the fall of the Shadow Messiah led to a loss in national power that continues even today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Internally, they delve into the forbidden arts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>While externally, they continue to lose control over the soldiers within their borders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Sounds like they deserve it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>The following order has arrived from Greed Dike: "Having repeatedly committed such injustices as to be unpardonable in the eyes of the Holy Order of Babel, the Wratharis Guard is to be quietly annihilated."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Pfft. Pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Of course, it is very likely that one of Greed Dike's motivations for this is to get on Northern Pride's good side, but be that as it may...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>We have already obtained the troops' patrol routes and shifts. You ought to be able to assassinate your targets even without memorizing their faces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>I would also like to have you take care of this for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>A-alone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Not only did the Wratharis Guard collude with a band of thieves from the region, but we have learned that they also embezzled a Wratharian national treasure that was originally stolen by those thieves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Naturally, they have since wiped out those thieves in order to erase all evidence of their crimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>They were a small band, these thieves, who called themselves the Golden Wolves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>You don't think you're giving her a bit much to deal with?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>I am merely watering a seed so that it may grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>I'm the one who gave you that assassination job in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Wratharis is in the middle of fighting a war on its borders. If they capture her, she'll probably be executed on the spot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>You would prefer that I be the one to meet the headsman's axe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Yep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>Not even a split second of hesitation! You really are too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>What about that lengthy process you were so proud of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>This is necessary for selection. Of her powers, her personage...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Giudecca</td>
<td>I believe you're doing something similar, yes?</td>
</tr>
