<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Now I think... My sister really was a terrible liar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>She may have not lied to me directly, but she didn't tell me everything. I think that's not so different from lying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I didn't understand what following the code meant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>For Natsume, it meant protecting the people who created and followed it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Just like how the Scarlet Flame Guard fought to protect their code and their beliefs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>She was protecting me, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Even though she knew that doing so would take a toll on her body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Really... She was a clumsy fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're an idiot, Natsume.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But the fact that I never noticed how you felt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That makes me an even bigger idiot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Natsume, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I wonder how you died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I spent years slaying demons, exterminating evil, and protecting Wadatsumi from corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I didn't know how long my body would last. The knowledge that I was running out of time was exactly why I was able to devote myself to the code as I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I wanted to protect it all. Ren, Wadatsumi, their futures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm sure I'll die well before I'm able to achieve that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I don't wish for a quiet, peaceful death. If I'm to die before completing my goal, I'd rather leave behind whatever I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The moment I thought it, I began to truly feel just how short my remaining time was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What remains beyond all the killing? Nothing could change the fact that my body was dying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I had no excuse to talk down to Ren like I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'm ashamed of how I spoke to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I see... So he's in Envylia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I hope you're well, Ren... I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It seems I have to leave the code and my dreams in your hands after all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Even after all I've tried to do to prevent it from coming to this... It's so frustrating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Someone prepare me some paper and a brush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Thank you. Please, give me some privacy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Now, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>"I'm sorry, Ren." Ha. Hahahaha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>After wielding a sword for so long, I can't even hold a brush...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So be it. This is what fate has decided for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It may be pitiful of me, but I must ask you to exorcise the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The Shiba Senko have been up to no good, and their actions have caused the number of demons to rise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This should be my responsibility, but my body can no longer handle it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Laugh and curse at me as much as you like, I don't mind. But for the good of our code...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I must ask for your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I don't want to burden my sweet little brother any more than I have to, but I couldn't think of anyone else who could take on this responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Not because you're my brother. Not because you're a Black Star. Not because of our code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But because I would give everything to protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That's why I trust you with this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>In addition, it's possible that we may need someone with Black Star blood. That is our current situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You are under no obligation to accept. This has nothing to do with the code. It is a simple request from me, your sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I want you to be the one to do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm afraid it's difficult for me to write any more. I don't know if you'll read this letter. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I wanted to entrust you with this one thing of mine at the end of my days, Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Selfish, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Even I'm surprised. All my life I've adhered strictly to our code, and yet now that my life is at its end I want to ask for something completely unrelated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I don't expect you to forgive me. I understand if you hate me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I just don't want to die lying to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>This is my honest, selfish request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Please... Please...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The only thing I can do now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>And so you resist within your restrictions... I've taken a liking to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Should I care?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Maybe. Have you heard this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The blade Sumeragi is no longer enshrined where it once was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Don't be ridiculous! The Kagomurasaki have protected Sumeragi for generations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Even if what you are saying is true, as the head of the Black Star clan, the true wielders of the blade, I would have been informed of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yes, usually that would be the case. However, other forces are in play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You've heard, haven't you? About Jin, the older brother of Yomi, the head of the Kagomurasaki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...The man who killed his own family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yes. It seems that Yomi has left Wadatsumi in pursuit of Jin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You mean to say that in her absence the sword has been moved? How do you know this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>The Shiba Senko are making moves. They plan to bring corruption never before seen to this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Add the goings-on with the Kagomurasaki, it's only natural that the dying head of the Black Star wouldn't be informed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Only a very small number of the Kagomurasaki are aware that Yomi is pursuing Jin. They don't want to worry the Black Star any more than necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Or at least that's what they say. I'm sure they don't want it getting out that there is internal strife within their ranks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I asked you why you know all this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Didn't I tell you? I have my own goals. It just so happens that I hear quite a lot in the process of pursuing them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I believe that Wadatsumi will be faced with a great crisis in the near future. One that may call for the use of Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I hope I'm wrong, but if I'm not...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...I suppose it's time to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Lady Natsume! You'll aggravate your condition!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Don't try to stop me. This is for the Black Star and for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I hope you'll be kind enough to grant me this final bit of selfishness. This final wish: let me go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I can still wield a sword, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I am no longer what I once was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>(It feels heavier than it used to... If I fight like this, I'll...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I can't watch this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You're about ready to keel over on the spot. Is your code really so important?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>No. I'm doing this for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I still don't understand you. You'd use the remainder of your life on something like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I don't need for you to understand me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>If you're here, that must mean that you're going to Sumeragi. Is that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I don't need any help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>No need to be so strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I said I don't need any help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>If you're allowed to act selfishly, then so am I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I'd like to see where this leads you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>You're a strange man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>As I said before, I've taken an interest in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You planned for me to come here, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>And if I did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>That doesn't change what I have to do. I'm going to die how I want to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>It's better to burn out than to fade away.</td>
</tr>
