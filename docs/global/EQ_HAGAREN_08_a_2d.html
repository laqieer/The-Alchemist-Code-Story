<td>Welcome to Slothstein! Ahh, I missed this place.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>I feel like Winry would really like it here.</td>

<td>Edgar's country of birth...and where his bike was made, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well, it's an improvement on Northern Pride, but it's no paradise...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's perfect. I can't help but feel like this is a wonderful country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This country has the same rhythm and feel that you and your bike have, Edgar. It's calming.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, I see. W-well, I mean, that's fine, then. Haha...ahem. I'm glad that the General appreciates it.</td>

<td>So, um...about the towers... I kind of remember something tower-like being built around here when I was a kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>When you were just a kid? Then...it's probably finished by now, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I mean, it was over ten years ago. At least we know where it is this time, so we don't have to run around looking for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Let's make use of this time to prep and eat properly. General, wanna try a cheese dog? It's pretty popular around these parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We've arrived... I can't believe this! It's been over ten years! How can they not be finished with construction yet?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ah... I guess it's about what you can expect from a country named after Sloth. So...the homunculus who guards this tower must be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It doesn't seem like he's going to come out on his own. This is a good chance for us to take out those guards first!</td>
