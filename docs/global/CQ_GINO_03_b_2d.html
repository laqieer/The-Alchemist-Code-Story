<td>Grr… H-hey you! Stay by my side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>B-but…with all these bandits… We should run away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Just shut up and get behind me. Squirming like that makes things difficult for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hey, hey, you're only playing defense, huh? What happened to that confidence you had earlier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Dammit… At this rate…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hyaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>?! W-who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Me? I'm Victor, Envylia Royal Knight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>H-he's strong… So this is the power of a real knight…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Thank you very much! You saved me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If you hadn't come, I don't know what would've happened… And I'm so impressed with the power of you two Envylia knights!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hm? Well, I'm just…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes! And feel safe! Envylia knights are sworn to protect the people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Right, Gino?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Um… yeah…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Alright, then. We've captured all the bandits, so case closed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Don't expect your first real battle to go perfectly. Plus, you're still a cadet at the school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Also, you're not a knight yet. Don't go into battle alone like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I commend you for wanting to save that person, but if I hadn't come, things could've gone badly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's not like I asked you to come…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You're really a piece of work…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well… you did save us…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Thank you…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But, why were you even around here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I was just scouting around. There were rumors of bandits appearing in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I also thought to go look for a missing cadet that wandered off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>W-why… How…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's also the job of knights to look out for rambunctious young cadets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh? What's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You know, I used to be a bad kid. I got into random fights and got beat up. I was terrible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>At the time, I wanted to get stronger only for myself. That's why I got into fights. To get used to fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But one day there was a knight that helped this little brat. And he said it was his duty to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That gang that was beating me up got wiped out instantly by the knight. Vettel… he was just amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It was then that I decided to become a strong and proud knight like Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>And then you became a knight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yup! Good story, right? That's where it all changed for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>? What now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Just…cheesy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huuhh? Cheesy? That was a great story!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Nope. Really cheesy. A cliched episode.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>R-really…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>W-well, cheesy or not, that's not the point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>To become a strong knight, you need the spirit and the confidence and you must remember that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yup, yup… Getting serious about it like that is also cheesy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What the…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(Although…I can see how strong you are with that conviction.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>So, what made you want to become a knight? Not fair to only share my story here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Not fair? You said your story all on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Shut up! Just tell your story!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Fine then… Really… The reason I wanted to become a knight…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I want to protect the people of Envylia and to become much, much stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oh, sorry Gino. This story is probably boring you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Uh-uh. It's so cool, Fraise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Huh? R-really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yeah! I want to be like you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(That's right, I also…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Well, well… We didn't see you around and here you are on your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Gino! You were instructed to observe and report! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I… I apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Let's not be too harsh. According to Victor, he was very helpful in the ordeal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Those burly bandits were taken out by only these two. How amazing Fraise's brother is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Commander, you are mistaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Do not refer to him as "Fraise's brother." He is Gino.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>He may be terribly impertinent and negligent, but when a person needed help, he couldn't back away. He is truly an exceptional cadet on the way to becoming a knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You're right. We are looking forward to you becoming an exceptional knight one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Hm? What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Umm… Well… It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Hm? Alright, nevermind then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Anyway, I'm proud of you. Even though his name was mentioned, I thought you were going to lose it again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You know, I'm just not going to let it bother me anymore. I know I'm at a different level than he is right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Hmm…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>And so…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>?! Why are you suddenly lowering your head?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I apologize for saying you look weak when we first met. You're strong. I now know what a real knight is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I realize I don't have the strength at the moment to be a knight. So I request for your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>W-what is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You're brash and easily get angry so I thought you were completely different from him…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>But how straightforward you are…is just like him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>What? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>As for helping me with training, what's your answer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Well, if you're going to be that serious about it, sure. I'll help you personally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>R-really…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Sure. But…it's going to be tough. Don't cry and run away to your brother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>D-don't you dare say that!</td>
</tr>
