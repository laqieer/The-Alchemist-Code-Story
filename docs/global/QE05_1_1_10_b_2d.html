<td>I-impossible! We outnumber you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Thinking of us Paladins as just another group of knights was your downfall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Our defenses...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What the...? What's going on?! What do we do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Everything has gone according to plan. Send a message to every soldier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wipe them out and show no mercy! Hunt down every last one of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Lord Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Do you object, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The enemy has been defeated. There is no need to pursue them any further! That will cause pointless casualties on both sides!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Did you forget? Those Royal Army soldiers burned villages and massacred civilians!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's true, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Justice lies within one's own heart. The will to strictly discipline one's self is the only way to restrain excessive power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>These men have strayed from that path. Drunk with power and plunder, they've strayed from humanity. They are nothing more than beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Beasts that have learned the taste of human flesh will hunt people again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Unless we vanquish them now, more innocents will fall victim to their frenzy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Not all of them are like that! Surely some of them just could not object to their orders!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Pandering to an evil authority is an act of evil itself. Had they any moral foundation, they would have stuck to their principles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If they were apathetic enough to willingly follow evil, then they are nothing more than cattle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>As long as they remain loyal to the same handler, they will continue to obey evil commands, becoming beasts ruled by their own bloodlust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But this is just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You have been sheltered by the great tree for too long. Watch and learn. This is what it takes to extinguish evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This is what is necessary to represent absolute justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I was looking for you, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Teona. I heard you were going to join the Liberation Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I am a gladiator. I have fought only within the boundaries of rules and regulations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I have never felt that to be restricting in any way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Follow the rules and challenge one's own skill by taking on opponents face to face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>There was honor in that. I was proud of that, and carried myself without shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But the way the Royal Army fights... It lacks any of that honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Subjugating through violence, cutting down the unarmed, and pillaging as they please...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I cannot let that pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It seems that Waginau will be with the Liberation Army for a while as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, I heard that as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>He goes too far in the name of his own justice. Somebody has to keep him in check, or else more unnecessary blood will flow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You mean to take on that role?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I know what people will think. How could a simple gladiator question the acts of the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Even so, I must help this civil war come to an end with as few casualties as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I want to do whatever I can to prevent more children from ending up like Hisham.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I've been told there have been countless villages burnt to the ground by the Royal Army for the sin of supporting the South.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If a child was wandering alone where you found him, then that could only mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yes, most likely...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Are you going to head back home, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes, and...I will be taking Hisham with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Will you? I'm sorry to renege on my promise to protect him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It can't be helped. Under these circumstances, we do not have the time to find his parents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>If we prioritize his safety instead, there is no other option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Even if this means I am leading him down the same path I once walked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What do you mean, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>No, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Well, I guess this is goodbye. I had hoped we would have the chance to cross swords once more, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I am grateful that I now have the opportunity to stand up against inhumanity. Thank you both.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Thank you for everything you've done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Same to you. Well, um...see you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Change the country for the people, huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That is a noble cause, but...this civil war will continue on as long as that is the motivation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The Sacred Stone and this civil war... What is this apprehension in my heart?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I must hurry back and tell the chief of everything I have seen and heard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>People of Gluttony Foss! Our country is in turmoil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Not only do we face discord with Saga and rebellion from the desert dwellers, but also this uprising by General Leordas in the South!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>General Leordas' reckless actions have led to the devastation of our southern resources, the effects of which have reached even our royal capital!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>We of the North have been forced to suffer because of the General's despotism as transport of necessary goods has been delayed and they have hoarded their access to trading ports and harbors!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Are we to let the South continue their insurgency?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>How much longer can we endure the desecration of our pride as Gluttony Foss of the Seven Kingdoms?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I say, no more! We must take decisive action immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What do we hold most precious in our country?! What do we value above all?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It is you, the people! The strength and righteousness of each and every one of you who have loved this country are the greatest treasures this country has!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>To protect something so valuable as that, we must stand together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We must unite, to crush the wickedness and deceptions of the enemy, and to allow true justice to shine in our country!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Quite the speech.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I do not appreciate your sarcasm. To incite the ignorant masses, a little exaggeration is necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>That little inspiration has turned every citizen into a soldier for your cause. That will increase casualties exponentially.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>That will not be an issue. I did not lie about the people being our most valuable resource.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>We have the largest population in all Seven Kingdoms. Greed Dike and Northern Pride do not even come close to our numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Casualties can be supplemented with ease.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>It seems your people are little more than pawns to you. This is an ideology that conflicts with ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>And? As long as our interests align, you will do nothing, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>It would be wise, however, not to test our patience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>If it becomes unfavorable for us to ally ourselves with you, it will be your head, not King Narol's, that rolls down the castle hall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Huh, I'll keep that in mind.</td>
</tr>
