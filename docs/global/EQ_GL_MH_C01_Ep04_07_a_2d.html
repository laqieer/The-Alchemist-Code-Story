<td>001</td>
<td>Mm. So that's why you came looking for me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Well, now that you're all here, we'll have a better chance of unravelling these mysteries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Some time ago, I was strolling in the woods behind the house when I ended up... here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(I thought so...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I retraced my steps after retrieving my equipment, and found that these strange ruins were improperly excavated a number of months before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Remnants of their implements buried in the debris indicate haste in their operations. They were eager to leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Some of the monsters that surrounded us seemed different from the wildlife in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That is correct. They are not indigenous to this part of Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I can only conclude that they were contained within those rooms. However, I have no explanation as to their purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They, much like the various machines you see around you, evade elucidation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's not just the entrances that show artificial damage, either. This place wasn't simply abandoned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Very good. I expected nothing less from my dear apprentices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The hypothetical chain of events is, therefore, as follows...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The excavators utilized improper methods to uncover artifacts in these ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>In doing so, the monsters sealed within were accidentally released.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Fearing for their safety, they vacated the premises, but not without detonating explosives to seal off the access.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The tanks were shattered in the process, causing the substance within to seep into the surrounding area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Could it be that the substance itself is the cause of aggression in the local wildlife?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That is precisely what I feared. I've detected worrying concentrations of Alchemia particles in the surrounding woods, and they appear to differ from the norm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The beasts that escaped containment may have savaged the excavators who failed to escape in time, and acquired a taste for flesh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>These particles may be causing changes in their biology...but to what extent, I am uncertain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No worries, Teach. Lead the way and we'll find out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>In that case, let us return below ground. There are several other such chambers in the vicinity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Um... I don't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Don't worry. I'll look after you, so tell me if you feel faint again, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The party heads below once more. Upon clearing away the debris, they find more of the strange machines buried within the rooms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Minerva begins to inspect them one by one, with her expression growing grimmer by the minute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The sheer number of these machines may be evidence that this was once the site of a production facility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Was that...a tremor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>How strange... I don’t recall this area being anywhere near a fault line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Urgh... My head...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I think the contamination might be affecting him. We should take him back up as soon as—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>*gasp*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>A large lumbering shadow begins to rise from the heap and its every step causes the ground to shake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Its eye-like sensors flicker, as if detecting something. It pauses, and begins to zone in on Minerva.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>*Whiiirrrr...*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Teach, watch out!</td>
