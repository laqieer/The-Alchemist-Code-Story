<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(Now... There!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You win. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I can see why surpassing the Lord Commander will be worthwhile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I wasn't holding back. You've gotten stronger, Yauras.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I've still got a long way to go. I'm definitely nowhere near surpassing the Cadanova I fought that day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But I swear that I will surpass him...and you, Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yauras... You need to use different styles. There is no absolute when it comes to magnificence... Just like how magnificence never manifests in the unrefined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You understand that now, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I...! Thank you. I swear that I will become stronger, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Heheh. I feel like I'm finally free of doubt. Thank you, Lord Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(She's close to surpassing Cadanova. Yauras really has gotten stronger.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I can't afford to be idle, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, that was quite the show. It's nice to watch people grow. A rhyme? How strange of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Let's go, Kaya. Let's complete our task in Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>When we return to Northern Pride, I will consider my responsibility complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So...you've finally decided?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes. I cannot be idle while those under my command are moving forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(I will spread justice throughout the continent alongside them. That will be my parting gift to Cadanova, and to Kaya!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Thank you, Kaya. It is because of you that I was able to see the path I needed to take.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Our paths may be different, but I will strive to give you no cause for worry as I set out on mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Then let us continue on our journey of discovery. What were the Cursed Beasts? For what purpose was the Holy Guard created?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Finding these answers and exposing the truth is something that I must do as Lord Commander. I truly mean these words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>However, this will be the last time that you and I walk the same path!</td>
