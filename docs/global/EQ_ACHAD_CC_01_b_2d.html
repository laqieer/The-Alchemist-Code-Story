<td>Hi there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Come on, smile for the audience. The spotlight's on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Unbelievable! Just as our beloved Amu seals her fifth victory in a row, a mysterious interloper jumps into the ring!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hello! Good evening! Welcome, one and all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Is that another one of your toys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No! I've never seen that man in my life! What is the meaning of this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Do you believe in God?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It appears even the master does not know the identity of this mysterious challenger! Who is this guy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>My name is Jester.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>"Jester"? Is he some sort of clown?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Dear audience, are you still not satisfied?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I've come because I thought wreaking havoc in this unsightly place might brighten it up a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>After all, this silly stage serves only to provide brainless amusement. It has no other purpose whatsoever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So, what do you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Shall we start your sixth match of the day?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oho! Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new challenger! How will the master take this sudden declaration? Will he approve?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>An unknown challenger? Things are finally getting interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Heh... Heheh! Hahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Very well then! Whatever it takes to liven up the place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It sounds like we've got the master's approval! The interloper is to be Amu's sixth challenger of the day! Will our poor, exhausted Amu be able to handle six matches in a row?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Amu! Amu! Amu! Amu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What a generous welcome! Thank you, one and all, for your lovely ovation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Amu! Amu! Amu! Amu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Amu! Quick, get back inside! This wasn't the deal! You don't have to do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Y-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The show must go on, dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Aahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>ARE YOU READY?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Amu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>START!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Have you ever seen God before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oho? What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Your eyes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>They're just like mama's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>A sharp jab out of nowhere! Did that man just pull her eye out?! This isn't looking good for the artificial maiden!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Haha... Hahahaha! Incredible! Absolutely incredible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>He took her left eye?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Don't look at me like that, Mama.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hngh! Aah...aarghh...nnrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'm not a bad boy, you know? I do my best every day. So don't glare at me like that. Don't look down on me. Don't turn your eyes away from me. Just look upon me kindly. Me and only me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wh-what is that man talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You won't die, will you? Please don't die, Mama!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Jester! Jester! Jester!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ahaha... Hahahaha! Kyahahahahaha! Hee hee hee hee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Go Jester! Kill her! Kill Amu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>We've been dying to see her fall! Come on! Do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>This is it! This is what we've been waiting for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Show us what the artificial maiden looks like on the inside! We want blood and guts! BLOOD AND GUTS!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>A standing ovation, just for me? At last, things are as they should be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Listen how they cheer for you! For your blood to be splattered across these walls! You've kept them waiting for ever so long!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I hope you enjoyed it while it lasted! Did you like prancing around in that ridiculous dress of yours? Did it feel good to fight while the crowd cheered you on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Amu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Run, Amu! This isn't right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Y-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Have you come to spoil our fun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Am! Quick! Grab my hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>This won't do. You weren't invited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>A-Amu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>This isn't your stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Ugh! What a pain. Corpses always miss their stage cue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>N-No... B-Bian...ca...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yes, go on. Get a good look at her. That will be you, soon enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Now... Pray quickly, or be damned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>N-no! Yes... No, no, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Is that all you can say? Don't you have any other words in your vocabulary? Well, this is no good! How are you going to plead for your life? How are you going to tell me how much you hate me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Jester! Jester! Jester!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Oh well. I suppose that's fine. You might look like Mama, but that doesn't mean you're the same person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Watch me, God! Witness, as I murder this pure and innocent girl for your amusement!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Watch me trample her human dignity in the most dreadful way imaginable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I'll slice, cut, carve, and smash her to pieces! If the audience has any requests for her demise, I'll gladly hear them! Cheer for me! Cheer only for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Aha! Will you listen to that?! The audience is just as wicked as I am! They do not fear to revel in sin or heresy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaarghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Try and save her, God! I dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>No! No! No, no, no! Aaaaaaghhh! Nooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Are you more foolish than the jester himself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Ngh... Aaaaaaaghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Pray. Fight back. Do something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>You have hands, don't you? Use them while you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You shall not raise your head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>You shall not resist your superiors. You shall not beg for help or handouts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>You shall have no will of your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>You shall be a slave. You may hold no hope in your heart, no whisper of independent thought in your soul. You shall be powerless against your betters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Amidst these unassailable rules of my life, all I had were my hands. I was allowed ownership of nothing else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Hey, squirt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>That day, I escaped, and fell into the world's garbage can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Nice eye you got there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>You looked at me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Bet you'd look even cooler with an eyepatch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>When I think back on that time, all I can remember is how terribly empty my stomach felt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>N-n-n... N-n...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Huh? What're you trying to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Come on, squirt. Let's get some food together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>The guy I was supposed to meet for dinner didn't make it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Why did you seem so lonely that day?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Why were you carrying such a fancy eyepatch in your pocket?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I couldn't begin to guess. All I knew was that even in the dark, deep underground, in that place untouched by sunlight, you looked like you were shining.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Th-th... Th-th-tha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>But I was still so terribly, terribly hungry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Huh? What is it now? Spit it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Th-tha...nk you...for the meal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>You haven't even eaten anything yet, squirt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Your gloomy smile was radiant to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Come on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>You held out your hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>You wanna eat, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>You held out your hand. And I seized it with both of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I didn't let go then, and I won't let go now.</td>
</tr>
