<td>This must be the old world home of the dragons, the majestic city of Hierosolyma. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I heard it was abandoned, but it still looks lively enough to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Not that it matters either way for my purposes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...I do enjoy a bit of a challenge, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>--What did you say was supposed to happen after this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well, if this place really is a memory of the past, then we should be able to get a head start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's a fool's errand, but we may as well give it a shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ready, Waginau? Just ahead is--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh? Was I asleep? ...What a strange dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That shadow... It seemed almost familiar, and yet completely foreign.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...Hmm, well just a dream, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I've been locked up here for over a week now. I must really be starting to lose it, seeing things that make no sense like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I hope you are comfortable, Lady Schmeier, my most diligent and wise dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh, not so bad I suppose--apart from this empty stomach, anyway. Getting to see that nice body of yours when I wake up certainly helps. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...It would be so much easier to appreciate without these bars, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I do apologize, but this body is nothing more than a facsimile of the human form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And it would be the height of disrespect to address a dragon such as yourself without keeping a reverential separation between us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>How about you cut the act and just treat me like a prisoner. That's what I am, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Would you prefer that? Well then, I shall remember such honesty is a virtue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...So? What is it that you want with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I have brought word from my master, Lord Ophioneus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yeah? Well, let's hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>"Join our army."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...That's it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That is it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Stop acting all high and mighty and just tell me what's going on already. What is this about the dragons' original sin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>--Perhaps I will enlighten you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey, wait! Wait! Weren't you going to "enlighten" me!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Aaaand he's gone. That body really does not suit him at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well, now what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm worried about Lil and Zafeiris, but what can I do stuck here like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Who'd have thought a dragon like myself would be rendered helpless by a simple iron cage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The city of pride, Hierosolyma, exists inside the ever-expanding Dragon Realm of Ophioneus...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Here, dragons and humans are equal--simple servants of the Dragon King.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I may be in over my head...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh ho, so that's what's going on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No matter how hard I try, my body just isn't suited for combat. What a pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I thought all dragons were tough, but I guess not, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hey! I don't need to listen to this kind of prejudiced--wait, huh? Who's there!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, sorry, sorry. I just happened to overhear some juicy info.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>So that's why my halberd felt so much heavier when I arrived in this city...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The very laws of the world are being rewritten--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Could this be the "Dragon Realm" power of the seven apex dragons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>--Who are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Matia. I was just passing by and thought this place looked interesting, so I snuck in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Though that may have been a mistake. I thought this was a place I could test my strength, but instead it's like I don't even have any strength here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I guess that explains why they don't need much security.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hello? I just introduced myself and everything. Aren't you supposed to tell me your name or something now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I, oh, umm-- My name is Schmeier</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...Sch...meier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yeah. Nice name, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>............Anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Aren't you one of the seven dragons? What are you doing locked up here like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Even the Dragon Realm has wars between factions... I was just one of its casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You're not from around here, are you? You don't seem to be from any of the seven layers. A castaway from another world, perhaps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You can stash the labels. I'm just me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I didn't mean to offend you. I'm just curious what someone like you is doing in a place like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I haven't seen many sightseers running around with halberds before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Like I said, I wanted to test my strength. I'm here to kill a dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Impressive. So am I your target then? I am one of the seven dragons, as you said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It's pretty hard to look tough when you're trapped in a cage, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But no. I'm after bigger prey. I decided I'm going to take down Dragon King Ophioneus, himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Yeah, that's not gonna happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'm starting to worry about that too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>As soon as I entered this place, I realized that as long as this Dragon Realm thing exists, I won't be able to reach the summit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Anyway, I was just about to sneak back out when I overheard your voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>So that's what you were up to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Well then, what if I were to hire you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hire me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I need to get out of here. I still have some unfinished business on the outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>And just what's in it for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I'll tell you how to kill a dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>----</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You said that's why you came here, didn't you? There's more to hunting than simple strength. It takes knowledge of your target to succeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Knowledge is power, after all. If you help me, I can give you that power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...Alright then, I accept.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Well let's hurry up and get out of here, then. I don't want to get spotted by anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Now? Just like that? Fine by me, but how do you plan to get me out of here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Like that. Now come on, let's get going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>...Um, er, I've brought your meal, but...huh!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Uh oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>..."Uh oh"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>TH-THE PRISONER IS ESCAPING!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Hmm, I didn't think it would be so loud...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>...What did you think was gonna happen!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Look, it was the most efficient way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>The most efficient way to do what? Alert the guards?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>...Don't worry. We just have to double down and we'll come out ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ok, now let's get out of here.</td>
</tr>
