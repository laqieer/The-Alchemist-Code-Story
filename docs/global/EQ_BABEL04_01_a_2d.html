<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Long have I awaited this moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Today's meeting, like the blue moon, was fated since the events of those bygone days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>And now, we fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't talk to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Tonight, you die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yomi, wait, I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>A long, long time ago...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Humans and demons fought one another, and both were desperate to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Demons devoured humans in order to live, and humans killed them so that they would not be devoured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>In the end, sadness and hatred enveloped Wadatsumi like a shroud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Why did you kill our father?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Why did you break your oath? Why did you disappear without saying anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Why did you leave me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>As the battle raged on, humans and demons quickly became consumed by their hatred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Amidst the chaos, a lone human man and a lone demon woman overcame their differences and fell in love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Pushing aside all opposition, they wed. Tired of the fighting, demons and humans alike were moved by their relationship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Thus, a pact was made. The demons swore that they would no longer devour humans, and the humans vowed never to kill another demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It is because of your foul deed that the honor of the Kagomurasaki Clan was besmirched.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We came to be despised as a household carrying the stain of bloodshed, and were ruined for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Now here I am, the head of the family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>So that she would never have to harm a human like her lover...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The demon broke both of her own horns. She fashioned one of them into a special stone, in which she sealed her godlike demon powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I won't forgive you! I will never forgive you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The grudge against our family, your broken oath, the shame of the Kagomurasaki Clan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>All of it! All of it is your fault!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huzzzaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Arrrrggghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The other horn, she made into a blade, so that if the demonic powers within the stone were misused, something would be able to subdue the stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This blade was passed down from generation to generation in my family, alongside my halberd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Come, let your blood rust my blade—Sumeragi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Nnnnnggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I can't die yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>So you will finally kill me, too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No, I want you to kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Similarly, the demon's human lover devised a technique that could be used against demonic powers, but swore that he would seal it away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>They would live out their lives together with mutual trust, as equals. What stood as proof of their bond and oath were the Sacred Three.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi, Sumeragi, and Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But not yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You're going to leave again! You're leaving me—leaving everything behind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This will be my requiem for you! Your death will come at my hands! Today, you die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I told you not to talk to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huzzzzaaaahhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>D-die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Die!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ngh! An arrow...? Where did—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Filthy heathens! Stop right there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Seize the heathens!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Get out of my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Don't let either of them get away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yomi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>No! Wait, don't go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>No, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Please don't go! Brother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Brother!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The creation of the Sacred Three brought peace to Wadatsumi. Shall I tell you an old story, one that has been around for generations?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It's the story of the Demon Extermination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>When I grow up, I'll protect you, brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You don't need to do that, Yomi. I am sure that I will be able to keep both you and Wadatsumi from coming to harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I don't wanna be protected all the time! I wanna help, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I know. You're a hard worker. You'll probably become far stronger than me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That's right! I am a hard worker! I'll get way stronger than you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>So it's a promise. Let's protect Wadatsumi together, no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>All right. I promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I mean it! Don't forget you promised!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Let's make a wish on a shooting star.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Let's make a wish so that we'll be able to protect Wadatsumi together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Jin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Say it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I already did, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>No, you have to say it properly. Say you promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Oh, a shooting star!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Huh? Huh?! Where? Where?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Just kidding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>The night sky sure is beautiful, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>My wish is that we will be able to look up at this sky together forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>A shooting star!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Hm. Just a dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Lady Yomi, please wake up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Old-timer? What is happening outside the mansion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>It is the Greed Dike soldiers. Having you in their custody is making them quite arrogant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I believe it was the right choice to have you sheltered here. I could not stand to leave you in the care of strangers, in any case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I am indebted to the Shiba Senko Clan for helping me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Hoho. You've truly become a splendid leader of the Kagomurasaki. To think that you were such a cheeky little girl, always giving me trouble...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>O-old-timer, please. Don't bring up embarrassing stories like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>It is not only the Kagomurasaki, now. In order to protect you, Lady Yomi, even the prosperous Shiba Senko Clan has joined forces with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>They have even agreed to shelter you in the Shiba Senko mansion. I feel that so long as you are here, you will be safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>What about Greed Dike?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I apologize for barging in while you're still recovering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>W-wait! I did not give permission for so many people to enter my mansion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I don't need your permission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>...Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>So, you are Yomi, head of the Kagomurasaki Clan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>I am Leafah, General of Greed Dike's Army. Please forgive my sudden intrusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I'm sure you didn't need to come here in person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I need you to hand over Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I heard that it is a sword that has been passed down in the Kagomurasaki Clan for generations. As you are the head of the clan, I have come to ask you directly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I am hoping that you can help me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Lady Yomi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>General Leafah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>It's fine. She is unarmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>You...! Who do you think you are?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I believe that I have already introduced myself as the General of Greed Dike's Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>It's your fault that I missed the opportunity of a lifetime!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I could have killed him if you hadn't...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>It truly was a shame. The Demonic Killer Jin, infamous for being the monster who murdered his entire family... He should not have been allowed to escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>He only got away because you resisted. I am very sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>If you hadn't been here in the first place...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I hear that you are, in fact, siblings. My reports say that your brother killed your father, so you tried to kill him, yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Blood spilling blood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Despicable. How typical of heathens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>How dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Heathens deserve no mercy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Argh! Nnnngghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>L-Lady Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Arrrrrggggghhh! My body...feels like it's...going to explode! I can't think... I...! Aaaaarrrrrgggghhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Is this...the same thing that happened last night?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Old-timer! Take her to the palace! Have someone carry her! Quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>We must perform the Demon Calming Ceremony!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Haaa...haaa...haaa... Ngh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>The soldiers of Greed Dike will lend a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I don't need anything from the likes of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Don't be like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>I do feel bad about what happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>The past cannot be changed. That is why I want to help you, so that we can move on into the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Wadatsumi is currently in a state of extreme chaos. It is Greed Dike's responsibility to deal with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>We will put an end to the chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>From here on out, we will join hands and create a path that serves the benefit of all. That is the consensus that Greed Dike has come to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>And that is why we need Sumeragi...and you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Wh-what does this have to do with m-me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>I'm sure you've realized it by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power that lurks in the blood of the leaders of the Kagomurasaki...and within you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>How...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>You...! H-how much do you know?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I studied what was necessary to put an end to the chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Yomi, the power inside of you has already begun to stir, hasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>The corruption caused by these troubled times in Wadatsumi was likely the trigger; coupled with your hatred for your brother, of course—but I'm sure you already knew that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Ngghhhh! Arrrrrggggghhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Something needs to be done about that demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Yeah, so that's why I've gotta go and exterminate some demons. Or, exorcise? Whatever you'd call it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Will you really be all right on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>It's a direct order from my big sis. If I don't go by myself, holy crap, but will I be hearing about it. By that, I mean I'll suffer. Terrible suffering. So much suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Seriously, though, I don't understand anything she says in her letters anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>You don't understand her instructions, but you're afraid of what will happen if you don't follow them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Outrageous, right? But it is what it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>She's, erm, rather strict, isn't she? Your sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>You don't even know the half of it. She's got the kind of strength that can turn your hair white with a single blow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>So that's why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Aw, come on. That was clearly a joke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>I've heard that without anyone left to govern it, Wadatsumi has fallen into a state of chaos. I know that you are capable, Ren, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Greed Dike's in the process of doing something about that. Unexpectedly, they're actually trying to fix it. Didn't see that coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>I told you, I'll be fine! I'll come home safe and sound. The Scarlet Flame Guard still needs me, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Hm? Where are you going, Ren?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Oh, hi, Natalie! I'm just going to pop over to Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Wadatsumi?! By the gods, what could you possibly have to do there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>That's a fantastic question!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>I have to follow orders, or else. You get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>It feels great to come back to good old Wadatsumi! Now, if only I knew what I was supposed to be doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Incriminate demons... Incriminate? What was it my big sis said? Something about carnal power...? No—incorporate? De...corporate...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Nah, there's no way she said something like that. Ahh, at this rate, she's gonna be so mad at me! I'm not ready...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>But I guess that's life. A rule, or a tradition, or something...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Outrageous, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Hey! Who are you? Are you a friend of this guy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Huh?! No, no, no! Nothing like that. I was just passing through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Seriously? Come on! I only just arrived in Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>I don't care. Let's just kill him, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Whaaaaat?! Why do you have to go straight to killing?! Hey, you, say something already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Protect yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>You're...injured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>It's just a scratch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Wow. Didn't even try to make it a believable lie. That is clearly a sword wound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>What are you babbling about?! Tch... I don't know whose clan you're from, but it seems like they haven't taught you manners!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>It must be a puny, pathetic little clan that nobody has ever heard of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Hey, what? It's like you've never even met my sister! Oh, wait. You haven't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Fine. I'll help you out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Just as long as you protect your own butt.</td>
</tr>
