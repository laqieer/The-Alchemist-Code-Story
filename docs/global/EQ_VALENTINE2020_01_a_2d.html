<td>Wait, so I have to take this huge load of cacao all the way to Lustburg? You've got to be kidding me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You have it wrong, Itsuki. You're not just taking it with you, you're protecting it as well. It's a very important mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That's even worse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well, there's no way around this. Trouble always seems to find the Rainbow Cacao.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Something always happens, almost like clockwork. Oh right, it's your first time with us, Leafah? It would make sense that you wouldn't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I know just how dangerous the Rainbow Cacao is. Don't look down on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Each color has a different effect, but the Purple Cacao is an especially dangerous substance because it charms monsters and people alike, causing them to lose control of themselves, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Whoa, you sure know a lot—for a kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I just look young!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>And of course I'd know at least that much. Ever since I became the General of Greed Dike, I've spent my days and nights studying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The General of Greed Dike...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Looking like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This isn't my usual attire! I was told it wasn't acceptable for Valentine's Day, so I ended up with this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Anyway! We've all done this Valentine's stuff many times already, so if you need help, just ask.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm Noah. Over there's Emma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm Itsuki! Nice to meet you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I am Suzuka.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Suzuka...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>N-nothing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(THE Suzuka?! I didn't even notice because her clothing doesn't seem very Wadatsumi-like at all.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(I've only heard of the stories of that battle, but she was not only a part of it, but lived to tell the tale. An actual Wadatsumi samurai...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We are taught that Wadatsumi is a heretical land, plagued by evil ideas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Evil ideas?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We are taught that it is a land of fanatical heathenism and savagery, a land where violence is used to encourage adherence to tradition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It is said that they will happily kill even their own blood for breaking tradition. Just like you are trying to do now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>How dare you! You're the savages who are all too happy to turn a blind eye to your past!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You took our country from us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Something the matter? Is there something on my face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ah! Ahem! I-it's nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I see. That's good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>U-um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Time is running out. Let us make haste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Something wrong, Emma?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hmm. Doesn't Suzuka look kind of scary?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Whoa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'm sure she's just on alert for our mission. We can't let our guard down either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Uh, I think that it's something else, but...okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I've heard reports of monsters infesting this area. Stay on your toes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hey Noah, what kind of chocolate do you think would be good this year?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Emma, do you listen to what people say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Last time I included a single spicy one, remember? So I was thinking this time around I'll put a suuuper sour one in! Wouldn't that be so funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Don't you dare!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I've prepared lots of red pepper for making chocolates!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Your love of spicy food is impressive as always, Itsuki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yeah, this time I'm gonna make it even spicier than the last!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Well, it's fine because you actually like it that way, but you, Emma, you cut it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Aw, okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(I'm sure in Suzuka's eyes, I'm probably the last person she wants to get to know, being the General of Greed Dike...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>(I was able to befriend Yomi, but a lot of things had to go right for that to happen.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(Nothing I can do about it given the circumstances. However, I can prevent our current situation from getting worse if I'm careful.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What about you, Leafah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yeah... Wait, what? Uh, s-sorry. What were we talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>We're talking about what kind of chocolates to make for Valentine's Day this year!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Make?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>We were talking about how after we're done with this mission, we're all going to make chocolate for each other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Geez, didn't I tell everyone that there are monsters everywhere in this area? Yet they act like nothing's wrong...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Don't act like you're not super excited as well, Noah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I never said I wasn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Huh? Make chocolate? And what do you mean by giving it to each other?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I can't wait as well! The best thing about Valentine's Day is giving the chocolates you made to all of your friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I'll make sure to give you some tasty chocolate too, Leafah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Huh? Chocolate for...friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You know about Valentine's Day, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>O-of course I know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It's the day you give chocolate to someone who you have romantic feelings for! Of course I know about that! I read about it in a book!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>B-but I didn't read anything about chocolate you give to just friends. That wasn't in any book I've read.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>W-well, a glorious general such as myself doesn't usually deal with childish traditions such as these...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You say that, but I can tell you really want to be part of this as well, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What?! N-not at all! I never said anything of the sort!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I haven't said that I want to give chocolates to Yomi because we're friends! Or that I want to give all my friends chocolates because I like them a lot! Or that I want to be included in that at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I have not said anything of the sort!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Okay, Leafah, calm down. You just said it by the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Uwaaaaahhh! You're wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I was just wondering what kind of chocolate Yomi would like!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>No, I was just listening to what you said and it made me think—you two really are close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I-is there something wrong with me being friends with her?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>No, none at all. I was simply surprised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I never would have thought that a person from Wadatsumi and a person from Greed Dike could ever have anything resembling a friendship. It is very...surprising.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>That's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Oh? It's getting awkward again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>It doesn't look like anyone's upset this time though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Can you not say that while looking at me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>What!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Whoa! There's so many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Geez, I've been saying that there are a lot of monsters here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Urgaahhh!</td>
</tr>
