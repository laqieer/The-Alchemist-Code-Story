<td>This village was built by people who were fleeing the chaos of the civil war after the Sephira Village was destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We are not supporters of the current royal family of Gluttony Foss. As such, I think you'll find this to be a suitable place of refuge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Thank you very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. I'm just helping out a friend in need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That being said... It is my duty to guard the altar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I cannot afford to accompany you any further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You've done more than enough. As for our next step, I intend to discuss that with Kamui when he wakes up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Good. Something I've learned is that charging ahead on your own never gets you anywhere good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well, then. Goodbye for now, young Crowley.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh? How do you know my name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hey, Logi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What is it, Tina? Did Kamui wake up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No, not him—the other one! That girl is awake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Mmm... Where...am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Agatha! You're awake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh? W-wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm so glad. I was starting to get worried that you wouldn't wake up. I'm—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I said, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Some kind of memory loss? This is a pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Sorry, but I'm no medic. I can do basic things like treating and dressing wounds, but when it comes to something like memory loss...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I guess we'll just have to wait for Kamui to wake up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>He might know of a way to restore Agatha's memories. That's kinda his specialty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hey! Pull yourself together, will you?! Moping isn't going to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>She doesn't remember anything. She wakes up and all of a sudden she's in a place she doesn't know, surrounded by people that might as well be strangers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You're her oldest friend, aren't you? You've gotta be there for her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I...! Y-you're right. Thanks, Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Geez. I can't believe I got landed with this cruddy role again. We're not even in Saga and yet here I am, helping people sort out their relationships with one another. Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Um... Can we talk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh! Y-yes, of course. I don't mind—um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>My name is Logi. Logi Crowley.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>All right. Sir Crowley—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You can just call me Logi! You...always have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>How are you feeling? Are you sore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No, I feel fine. It's just that I can't seem to remember anything about my past... I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>There's no need to be! I'm just happy that we're together again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Let me know if there's anything on your mind. If you'd rather talk to a girl about it, I'm sure Tina would be happy to listen to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Tina... Is she also a friend of mine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Not exactly. She's the girl who was just here. She took care of you while you were unconscious, but you haven't known her for long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hmm... I want to explain the situation to you, but I'm not sure where to begin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>All I can really say is that everything has changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>In that case... Do you think that you could tell me about who I am? Anything is fine. I really don't mind what you talk about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That's a good point. Maybe it'll help you remember something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>All right, so... South of here, there used to be this country called Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We grew up there together. You, me, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Troops have been dispatched to the Desert Zone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Are you sure about this information?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yes. This information comes directly from my compatriots who are hiding out in the royal capital.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Upon the command of Ceclidis IV, Your Highness, the troops are forming an invading army as we speak. As soon as they are ready, they will commence their invasion of the Desert Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Father... He's even using my name. It seems that there is much going on of which we are not aware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Indeed. They have taken the rug right out from under our feet, and we've been none the wiser.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>We have won the hearts of the lower classes, and gathered a respectable amount of power... Perhaps it is about time that we make our move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You might be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The Sephira people who fled to the Desert Zone are our trump card.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If the desert is captured, we lose any opportunity we once had of orchestrating a counterattack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What are our current numbers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I cannot say. Many nobles refused to listen to us and have already fled, taking their private armies with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>However, we may have just enough to catch them by surprise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>If we can slow the progression of their army by dragging them into some guerrilla warfare...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Then our runner might be able to reach the Sephira in enough time to warn them. I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I suppose this is our only option. We must do whatever we can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>As you wish, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>The tea is ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Th-thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Is something wrong? Do you...dislike it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>No! Nothing like that. It's just...nostalgic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You always used to make me tea that tasted just like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Even after losing your memories, you still make tea the same way... That makes me really happy for some reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I'm glad to hear it. I'm just...sorry that I can't remember it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>It's fine. There's no hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It doesn't matter how long it takes for you to get your memories back. All that matters is that you're safe. That's all I care about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>So... Where was I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You were telling me about the time I got lost in the forest when I was a child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You and... What was his name again? Oh, Dias, that was it! The two of you went into the forest to go and look for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>From the sounds of things...all I've ever done is cause you trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>No way! It's not like that at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You were always a huge help. You really helped us be a family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>And you know, your homemade stew was our absolute favorite meal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I see. So we were...a family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I'm really... I'm sorry that I can't remember anything. I will work hard to get my memories back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Like I said, there's no rush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>No, I want to. I noticed something, you see, while I was listening to your stories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I can tell that I was... That I must have been very happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Logi...? Wh-what's wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>N-nothing... It just suddenly hit me, that's all. You're...really here. You came home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I'm... I'm so happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Yes. It's all right. I'm here now. I'm right here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>(He's a good person. I'm certain of it. I feel nothing but kindness from him.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>(I just wish I knew...what our relationship once was. What were we to one another, all those years ago?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Where...am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Ah, so you're finally awake. We're in a little village in Gluttony Foss. That guy who called himself a guardian or whatever helped us get here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>That means we must be in one of the southern villages... Nnrrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Are you in pain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Not really... It's just that I used the full extent of my Spiritbonding powers for the first time in a while, and it looks like that's still taking its toll on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Still, I can't afford to hang around. By some stroke of fate, we have managed to gather three Sacred Stones here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>That makes us an easy target for that dang mage. He can sense them. I must get back to the desert as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Why? If he can find the Stones that easily, doesn't that mean you'll end up having to confront him sooner or later, no matter where you go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>The desert sands contain large amounts of Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>It will throw him off, making it the ideal place to conceal the Stones' existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Wait... Is that why the Sephira went into hiding in the Desert Zone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>It is. Thanks to that, we've been able to bide our time and grow our powers without drawing the attention of any unwanted eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Ahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Nnnghhh... Wh-what was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Did you see something, Tina? Something that's going to happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Yeah... I think so. This power hasn't activated in a while, though... Weird.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>It's likely that it was reawakened by a combination of the desert's high levels of Alchemia, and the lingering stench of the many battles that were fought here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Many lives were lost in this area in particular, in the civil war that took place here over a hundred years ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Yes, I don't find it at all surprising that the power of foresight has stirred within you again here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>So... What exactly did you see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Cities and villages were...burning. There were two men with swords...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>One of them I'd never seen before, but the other one looked familiar. I think it was...Georgios?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Hmm... That's Marie's cousin, a general of the Gluttony Foss army—but cities were burning, you say? Could you tell where they were?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Give me a minute... Mmm, sorry, but I have no idea. I could only vaguely make out the area. I did see that it was surrounded by Gluttony's forces, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>That doesn't give us much to go on. I wonder where Gluttony intends to strike?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I think it's best that we head back to the desert for now. Tina, go fill in Logi and Agatha for me, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Yeah, all right. I'll—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Aaaahhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Who the hell are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Get out of the way! We know you're sheltering rebels in this village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>You'd better hand them over quick smart, or else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Tch. I've had enough of this. Who do you think you are, huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>You wring us of every last drop we earn with your bloody taxes and turn a deaf ear to our pleas, but when you want something, you think you can just turn up and start ordering us around all high-and-mighty like, do you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>You...! You dare insult the glorious 2nd Regiment of the Gluttony Foss army?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>This is bad. If they keep going, there's going to be an uprising, and it won't be pretty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>What should we do? Should we rally together the people we have and drive back the army?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I only wish we could, but there are just too many of them. If we fail, we'd have nowhere left to hide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Worse still, this village would be drawn into the civil war. I will not let that happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>We can't just stand around watching, either! Look at them, they're gunning for each other's throats!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Get them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Isn't that...the man we met at the border?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>We can use this to our advantage. Together, we will be able to drive back Gluttony's army!</td>
</tr>
