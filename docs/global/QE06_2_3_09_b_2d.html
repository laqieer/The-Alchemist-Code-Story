<td>…H-Hey!... Azami!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You nitwit! You had me worried sick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm sorry…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You--You blockhead! You dunce! You dolt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ow! Ouch-Ouch-Ouch! Give me a break, Azami!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Only if you promise never to do anything foolish like that again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...I'm sorry. I promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hmm…I'll believe it when I see it. You have a tendency to never listen to anybody, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>H-Hey! That's not true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Enough of this infantile drivel. Amane, your recklessness has caused a great deal of trouble to the corps. Do you understand that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yikes, you're in for it now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That goes for you too, Tanosuke! How imbecilic can you two be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? You were the one who told me to do what I had to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>And I also prayed that you would take some precautions, didn't I? I told you to take a rest because it would be hard work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wow. What a saint…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...This is why the Third Squad is--Forget it. I'll think of a suitable punishment later. For now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We should hear what you have to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes, you. Why have you drawn the demons' attention? And what happened after they took you away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Let's start there, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>… Er… I have no idea why they took me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Are you SERIOUS!? You've got to be joking. You must've seen or heard something, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well…the thing is…before I realized it, they had blindfolded me…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…The Discarnate Power was talking about wanting to destroy humans and create a world of demons, as per usual... But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>…I remember there was talk about wanting to meet the "person inside me." They wanted to split us apart, or something…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>AH-HAAAAAA! Come to think of it--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Not so loud. We can hear you just fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power put his finger on my head---making a weird plunging sound! Do you see a hole in my head?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>…Looks normal to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>…Phew! THAT's a relief!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…Is there anything else you can remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hm, let me think… So, after that I fainted…and that's when I had a dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>…A dream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Well, not exactly… How can I put it? Someone began talking to me. From somewhere deep within me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>He spoke about…a memory of the earth, deeply ingrained in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>A memory of the earth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...But the story was interrupted. I'm guessing because Captain Tanosuke came to rescue me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Way to go, dingbat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Me!? How was I supposed to know I was interrupting anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You pulled off a successful ambush, but it's a wonder you escaped the Discarnate Power…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>About that…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(…Uh-oh. I should probably keep quiet about Jubei.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(Captain Ugachi is present, after all. We'll just let this one slide for now.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>…However…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Unbelievable... I thought it was just a fairy tale. Even more surprising--humans and demons...were once the same?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I guess? It depends if you believe my dream…or…vision or whatever it was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>…What do you think, Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>... I don't think it was a dream or some made-up story. I'm not sure, but…I think it's real.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>So, the demons are not our only enemy…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If so, then who is the one responsible for spreading this "evil?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>…At this stage, there's only one possible explanation. They may have been toying with the people of Wadatsumi all this time…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>…Um, do you have any leads?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ah-ha, I get it. It's obvious, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>…All signs point to Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
