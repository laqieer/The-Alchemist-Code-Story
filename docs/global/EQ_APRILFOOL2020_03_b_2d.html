<td>It's kinda concerning how easily her views are swayed...</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Shall I take you to him?</td>

<td>If a container is an object for serving food, does that mean everything that touches food is a container?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh? Oh. Hey, Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Acht... You are not such a container.</td>

<td>I think he's talking about the piece of apple stuck to your cheek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh! Umgf... Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>As for you... I'd heard someone was looking for me, but I thought they'd be a little more... satisfactory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wh-whoa! Could you back it up a bit? You don't need to get right up in my face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You've got some apple on your collar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Umgf.</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>He ate it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Level Up!</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There's that voice again... What happened this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>These apples aren't very good. I'm sure you must still be hungry, Acht.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yeah, a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>See? I knew it! When it comes to apples, you can never have enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Speaking of apples, I believe I heard someone—I can't remember who—say that they were cultivating apples that would really fill you up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No way! You mean like ones that'll give you even more EXP than Crystal Apples?! Huh...? Crystal... Apples? What're those again? Anyway, Sol—we need to talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>About?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well, since we're both transfer students and all, I thought... I thought... What was it? I could've sworn it was something important...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Loss... I know the feeling. Sometimes the things that are important to us just... slip away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh? Did I... lose something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I wonder... If one day you suddenly lost all sense of something you once knew, would you be afraid?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I... Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Haha. I suppose it's not something I should expect you to understand on the spot. Never mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's only natural that the things we feel are very different; we are two separate entities, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>However, know this: So long as we don't forget about the things we've lost, I believe we will always find our way back to them—or them to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We might miss them for a time, but we can be reunited with them again. Something to keep in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I don't really get it, but... cool. Thanks, Sol. You, too, Acht.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You only need to thank Sol. I didn't do anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's not true! You helped!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Which would make you happier? I'm still not sure... I think I'll need to continue my investigation a little longer.</td>
