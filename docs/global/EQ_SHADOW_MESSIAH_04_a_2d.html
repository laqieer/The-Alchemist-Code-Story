<td>Hey, Letitia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes, Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's an Obsidian Star.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What's an Obsidian Star?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well, a giant tree known as Sephiron once grew in the vicinity of this forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I know that. I read about it. They called it the Tree of Life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's right. Well, these dark stones are a material known as Sephirium, formed by the Sephiron's sap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sephirium? But the book I read said that stuff glowed blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It normally does. The Obsidian Stars are mutations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Mutations?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>In fact...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It is said that this substance was created when Sephiron was corrupted. The impure sap that flowed from the great tree solidified into these stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Impure sap? So this glossy luster comes from corruption?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes... It is quite pretty, isn't it? Hee hee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Impure sap... What a fitting substance for the two of us to pursue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Eh, sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Indeed, Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Lord Zahar! We've found them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hah. Good. Dig them up and we'll bring them back to our base.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes, my lord!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>H-help me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The corruption sealed within the Obsidian Stars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Is that possible? I had no idea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It would seem so. The corruption must be reacting to the darkness within us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Haha. Interesting...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Lord Zahar? What are you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Heed me, Corrupt Darkness! Your power will be mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Lord Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ngh! Aaaaaaaaaarghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Foul creature of sin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Foul creature of sin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Foul creature of sin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Is this... the voice of corruption?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You! You're the High Elf I killed in the mansion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Filthy half-elf! Unforgivable! You will not get away with this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, Zahar... Corrupt child of mixed blood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Was it not enough to claim my daughter's life when you came into this world a cursed half-elf? What cause did you have to murder a noble High Elf in cold blood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>May you rot in hell for your crimes, half-breed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hah! I thought I recognized that old squawk. You're the decrepit elf who drove Letitia and I from the mansion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Foul creature of sin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Foul creature of sin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Foul creature of sin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Foul creature of sin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Foul creature of sin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>May your sins claim you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hah! Are these bitter voices meant to make me reflect on my supposed sins?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Haha... Mwahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Don't be absurd!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I walk the path of righteous conquest, the path that leads to the new order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Mine is the true path! The path that exists to destroy the present and establish a new age!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Pronounce me guilty of sin if you wish, but there are those who carry with them my will, and in the new world they will be the ones to turn darkness into light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Corruption? Sin? Bah! Such trifles are nothing to the King of Darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I will devour them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Lord Zahar! Are you all—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Don't worry yourself, Letitia. This corruption is powerless before my might.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>L-Lord Zahar, the corruption is... mirroring us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hah! Interesting... We have to fight ourselves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Then come, corruption! Your powers—and the magic of the Obsidian Stars—will be mine!</td>
</tr>
