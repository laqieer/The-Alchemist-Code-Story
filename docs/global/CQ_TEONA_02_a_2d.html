<td>Come on. Seriously! Where is she?! I've searched all over town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Her skill with the spear...I want to see it again. Besides, until I find out what her name is, it'll keep eating at me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...Hm? That girl in front of the flower shop...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Heheh... What beautiful flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I knew it! It's her! Who knew she could wear such a soft expression on her face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...Snap out of it. Now isn't the time to admire her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey! Do you remember me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...You.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh... You were giving off a completely different vibe from the other day, so I wasn't even sure if it really was you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...What do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>There's a lot I want to ask you about, but first, I have a request for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I want you to bout with me again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Your skill with the spear is amazing, but I'm something of a sore loser. Please, let me fight you once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>My honor as a gladiator is on the line. As absurd as my request is, I wish for you to indulge me. Please...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Even if we were to fight again, I'm sure the result would be the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What...?! How can I know unless I try?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Are you going to remain silent again? In that case, I have an idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...An idea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I will present you with this special cheesecake made from the freshest of cheese! It's one of my favorite sweets!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hmph... Is this still not enough? In that case, I'll buy you whatever food you want! I'll take you to my favorite restaurant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's not the point...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You still won't grant me my wish? I guess that speaks of my inability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's still not the point...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>In that case, please train me until I am worthy to fight against you! Will you fight me then?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Your proposals are all over the place...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I don't care! I will do whatever I can to fight you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>There she is! It's her! She really has come to this city!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Heheheh. If we defeat you, we'll become famous! Sorry, but we're gonna have to take you out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hey, what are you guys doing?! I was talking to her first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Shut up, girl! Just because you're the only female gladiator here, don't let it get to your head! Stand back unless you want to get hurt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hey...! That swordsmanship of yours is quite impressive, but...I have my own reasons for standing my ground here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>If you're going to get in my way, I'll have to take all of you out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Aghhh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's quite the arm you've got on you, but it's far inadequate to defeat me. Are you all right over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Right. Of course. I'm in no position to be worrying about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No, but...you helped me. Um...th-thank...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That being said, I'm impressed how many people are targeting you. You really are an incredible person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Please! Let me train with you until I'm ready to take you on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Sigh... Fine. I won't be able to rest until I repay the debt I owe you for helping me anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The sweets you gave me can serve as your tuition fee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>But...whether or not I'll fight you again will be determined after that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Re-really? Yaay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...Well, all that commotion seems to have caused a troublesome crowd to gather, so we'll have to make it out alive first.</td>
