<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>This is great! Alright!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Kick the boyfriend's butt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I-incredible... They're evenly matched!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wow! Oh hey—weren't you also fighting with Leoniaz earlier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You've definitely improved since the last time I saw you fight—you've gotten more agile—but why were the two of you fighting, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>W-well...I thought Leoniaz was your boyfriend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>B-boyfriend?! Are you kidding me?! Why would you think something like that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>He's not?! Yes! I mean, er... In that case, perhaps we should stop those two?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm sure that lady reached the same misunderstanding! And that's why she wanted to duel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, no, I don't think so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Still... We probably should stop them. We've got a whole event to get through...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So! My beauty and strength do not outshine yours... Color me impressed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Your words do me great honor. However...if you truly think so, then it is only because you are not displaying your powers to their truest extent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Come again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I am but a humble knight...yet even I can perceive my opponent's true potential. You ought to be far stronger than me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You are certainly beautiful; yet amidst your radiance I detect doubt, and it weakens you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Doubt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Of all present, neither you nor I may be called the strongest. For that would be Shayna, whose shine is unwavering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Shayna...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You're quitting the Colosseum?! Why?! All the people gathered out here today are looking forward to seeing you fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>How could you betray us like this?! We adored you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Why can't they understand? Catering to their expectations was so incredibly tiring.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Being a famous gladiator... Being a star... The pressure was too much. I just wanted to throw it all away.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Laila! What's all this nonsense about you retiring from the Colosseum?! What else would you do, eh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What, indeed... Whatever I wish. Perhaps along the way I will meet someone stronger than I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So long as someone is there to see me shine, I've gotta do everything I can to make them happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's my duty! The duty of a strong and adorable shining star!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(You may have a point there, Shayna...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Stop! I'm calling a timeout! It's time for the two of you to play nicely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Awww! But it was just getting good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That matchup between Shayna's boyfriend and the mysterious beautiful fan was a dream! I, for one, had already placed my bets on the beauty's victory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>She's not my boyfriend! Jeez! Leoniaz is just here to help with the event's security!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Sh-she?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So she was a woman all along! I see... It all makes sense now. I knew you wouldn't do that to us, Shayna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Anyway... What are you doing here, Mistress?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>M-Mistress?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Why, I came to participate in the Shayna Fan Club Event, my dear. I even brought my membership card along. See?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>N-n-number one! She holds the hallowed 001!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Get a hold of yourself, man! What of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Get a hold of myself?! Did you not hear me?! She's number one! The first! The very first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The legendary membership No. 001... That makes her a veteran among veterans—a veritable god! Until now, none of us ever knew the identity of its owner...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What in the world are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's simple, really; I am Shayna's very first fan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Her first fan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Right... In that case, I shall be your very first fan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ah, yes! I heard about this earlier, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yes, well... As Shayna's first ever fan, I should think it only natural that I should participate in this, her first ever Fan Club event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>So you say, but that can't be the only reason you're here! I just know it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Indeed. Most astute of you, my dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I was certain that your event would yield at least one strong competitor for me to pit myself against.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>And I was right! A fine warrior, this one. How could I not try her out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I knew it! Haa... Oh, Mistress... What am I gonna do with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Wh-what? That's it? You're just going to let it go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Why not? Mistress is a champion of the Gluttony Foss Arena! She's right up there in the Hall of Fame alongside Teona herself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ch-champion?! No wonder she's so strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It's not every day she finds someone to challenge herself against, so I guess I don't blame her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(So she wanted to test herself against a strong opponent? I'm sure that's true, but I believe there's more to it than that...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Don't misunderstand; I meant it when I said that I would be your fan, Shayna, my dear. I am so pleased to see how much you've grown. To think, your Fan Club already has so many members!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Shayna... Do you ever feel like having so many fans is a burden? That the weight of their expectations is too much? That you...would like to be free of them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Hmm... I definitely worry about not being able to make everyone happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But I think trying to meet their expectations is part of what's really helped me grow, in both strength and cuteness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>So for me, that weight on my shoulders is kinda important. Just like the dumbbells I gave out at the beginning of this event!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>So your freedom includes the weight of your fans' expectations, and the ability to continue meeting them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...It is just as you said, Leoniaz. Shayna truly is the strongest of all of us here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>She uses the past to support herself as she continues to grow. That girl has truly found her own glow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I knew I saw something special in her. Meanwhile, I have been shielding my eyes from my own shine... Yes. She is far stronger than I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Now, keep that chin up! Be proud of your starry shine! For, one day, you'll find your very own glow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hmhm... I mustn't let her glow outshine mine entirely, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>And Leoniaz! How wonderful you are! I haven't felt my heart so thrilled by a battle in a long, long time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Your shine is both strong and beautiful to behold... It could light the way to your very own revolution! Let's spar again sometime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Heheh. I'd be much obliged. Our battle allowed me to pinpoint the gaps in my training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I will train hard every day in preparation for our next meeting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Oh, my! I do like that fire in your eyes! Your resolve to better yourself in order to face me is...beautiful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Um... Mistress? Are you sure you can afford to be, like, hanging out here? Don't you have a match at the Arena to get to, or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Oh, that? No, no, no. I'm no longer Champion. I gave it up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Huh? For real?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>And why not? Clinging to the past won't make me any stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>No way! I had no idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Naturally. I hadn't told you yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>But all the same, I've decided to return to it. For it is amidst the blood-tingling excitement of fighting that my strength and beauty are refined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Ta-ta, Shayna! Keep that glow bright! You are my shining star!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>And off she goes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Aww, dang! The event has barely started, and my number one fan has already left me high and dry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Oh, well. At least I got to see her again! Meeting her has kinda got me feeling all energized!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>That's wonderful! If you're happy, then I'm happy, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>All right! Then, without further ado, I'd like to begin the first ever Shayna Fan Club Event!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>First up is the Extreme Long Distance Forest Run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Oh, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I can't run a marathon after all that fighting! I'd pass out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Overcoming your limits is exactly the kind of training that'll help you refine your strength and cuteness! C'mon, guys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Somebody help me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Hmhm... Looks like they're all having fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Now... Once my security duties are done for the day, I'll have to give Luce a full report of today's events. I wonder where I should begin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>After that... Hmhm. I suppose I ought to get to work on refining my own strength and beauty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I'll have to increase my training regime... I wonder if Luce will join me? I'd like that very much.</td>
</tr>
