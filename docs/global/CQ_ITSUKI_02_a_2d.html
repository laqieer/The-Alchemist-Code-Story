<td>Tch! What's with this girl?! Don't think we'll hesitate to forcibly remove you if you get in our way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(A crowd is gathering... I really don't want to attract attention to myself.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Phew... We should be all right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hahh...hahh... Jeez! I didn't expect you to start running like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>M-my apologies. I just felt that we needed to get out of there as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, I can't argue with that...but I'm surprised you can run so fast in those heels of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hmhmhm. There's a trick to it. I trained myself rigorously so that I'd be able to run fast in these.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh! Would you like me to show you how? So that you can escape when necessary regardless of your footwear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Um...no thank you. I think I'll just avoid wearing heels like those.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well...that works, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Heheheh... Hahahaha! You're not like anyone I've ever met before, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hmhm. Finally, I get to see you laugh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh... Did I really look that grim earlier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Not exactly, but you did seem like you wanted to distance yourself from everyone around you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(Well, I did think you were a human.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Allow me to introduce myself properly. My name is Sophia. And you are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm Itsuki. Nice to meet you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Why were they after you, anyway? Who were those guys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Thugs who would take advantage of my powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I keep telling them that I will not help them, but they are very tenacious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I did not witness any serious injuries or perceive the risk of death in my future, but their numbers were a little worrying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>In your...future?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I try to tell my own fortune two or three times a day in order to avoid any threats that might come my way for being an elf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Why do you live among humans if you have to go through so much trouble?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Don't elves have places where they can be with their own? Wouldn't that be safer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I don't see why you have to live with the risk of being harmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Annihilate those man-eating monsters! All of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Uhm...Miss Itsuki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You injured your arm in that skirmish. May I see it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>There we go. All better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Th-thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hmhm. A friend of mine taught me how to heal like this, you know. A human friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I have many human friends whom I trust. Kind people who care more about heart than race.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I believe that not all humans are bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>So I can't bring myself to give up on trying to foster an understanding between our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>If I continue to try, I'm sure that one day a world of peace will come to exist for all people, not only elves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I'm not sure if I can believe that. There's no way we can come to a mutual understanding with the humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I know that better than anybody. Humans are afraid of beings different from themselves. That's why they persecute and oppress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>There's no guarantee that the people you believe you can trust will not have a change of heart. Humans are quick to betray you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Miss Itsuki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You can only say things like that because you still have a place you can go home to, where there are people who are happy to see you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I don't have that luxury.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I have nothing left. No friends, no home...absolutely nothing! Humans have taken everything from me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Miss Itsuki...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You must have been so lonely for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I still believe that there are many who can see people's hearts before they see their race.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>For example, well...I would love to be friends with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'm sure my friend would love to meet you, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>That's...just not possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Miss Itsuki, my friend is a good person. I can promise you that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I can't believe that! Humans cannot be trusted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Everybody I know who chose to put their trust in humans has ended up dead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Miss Itsuki, why don't I tell you your fortune?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Fortune-telling is meant for those who are lost. I want to help you find your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Wh-whoa! What's with this floating ice?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Where is the star whose shadow falls upon the ice? Where is the soul which drifts beneath the floe? With an eye above and an eye below, I will divine their radiant glow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>This isâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Miss Itsuki! We need to get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Back again?! You jerks just don't know when to quit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Get the little one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What are you doing?! I'm the one you want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Hah! Well, there's an expression we haven't seen on you before. You worried for your little friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Boss told us your compassion would be your downfall. Everything's going just as we planned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>If you don't want to see your friend get hurt, you'd better do as we say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>See what I mean, Sophia? There's no good that can come from trusting humans. They're not worth our time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What'd you say, wench?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>If this is what you want, I'll take you on. Try me!</td>
</tr>
