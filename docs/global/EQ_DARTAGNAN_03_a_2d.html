<td>Leak more information?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yeah. We'll make more security breaches and prepare an escape route.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>In other words, we'll bait them by using more tantalizing material, and, once they bite, we'll have them all in the net.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>After acting so boldly, even the spy scum won't think they can stay in Slothstein any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They'll try to escape. In order to do so, they'll want more souvenirs...that's usually the way these things go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>In that case, we'll use vulnerable information as bait to fish out the traitor. If we can take down the people who are backing them as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't you think that's really risky?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's one hundred times better than letting them run off with top secret information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well then, what's your choice? If you want to back down, now is your chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's good that your plan worked out and all, but...aren't there a little more of them than there's supposed to be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Stop complaining! My ammunition is limited as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hah. I'll give them credit for their surprise attack, but there are only two of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We'll crush them out by sheer numbers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tsk! Now I'm thinking we should'veâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yep. You should've just asked for my help from the start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Aghhhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Amis, you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Save the detailed explanation for later. Right now, focus on assisting the ally troops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What? Ally troops?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Agh, what's this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh? Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Didn't I tell you that it's dangerous to travel abroad alone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The Scarlet Flame Guard?! Impossible. Their alliance with Slothstein aside, they know what will happen if they cross borderlines unauthorized!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>While undergoing joint military training with Slothstein, we, from the Scarlet Flame Guard, learned of the danger that our fellow knight was in and merely responded to the circumstances!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Our actions are in no way unauthorized!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I see, so that's what Amis did...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Vice-Captain, your orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Before us are enemies of Slothstein whom are our allies. Thus, they are enemies of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Therefore, there is only one action we can take!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Knights, after me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huzzzaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I see. The 'fastest knight in history'...huh? With how little she turns back, it's no wonder she's so fast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Amis, I'm sorry but help us out. We'll need a little more ammo to cover her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>All right. I'll prepare it right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Onward, D'Artagnan! My baby girls and I will cover your path ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No...no... How could this happen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Nooooo!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Grrrrrhhh!</td>
