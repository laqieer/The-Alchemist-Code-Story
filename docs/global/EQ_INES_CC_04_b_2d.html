<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>It seems that within the past few days, someone other than ourselves has entered the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>How do you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The forest spirits are very sensitive. They can intuit malice, and can thus judge when those unassociated with the festival cross into their territory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This is a cause for immediate concern. The forest is sacred to them, and we of Northern Pride have never been allowed to cross its boundaries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If any trespassers were to harm the high elves, the consequences would be dire. The amnesty that exists between our peoples would be in danger of collapse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And the Divine Shelter the spirits are to bless us with during the festival may be withheld.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>To commence with the festivities and rituals under these circumstances would be in bad faith, I believe. We must take action, drastic or no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Does the high elf village not have a barrier around it? Trespassing should be no easy task. I fail to see that there's any cause for real concern here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That aside, I must say your behavior of late has superseded your role as guide, and is causing some unease amongst the nobles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>In short, we would prefer not to make matters worse than they already are. Postponement would simply be inviting chaos and disorder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I must insist. There is a strong possibility that Ines and her entourage could be in danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I've advised others on the committee to postpone the festival as well, but they seem more concerned about their own positions than the lives of those whose friendship we're set to honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Something must be done. This matter cannot be ignored. And thus far, I seem to be the only person who's giving it the attention it deserves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Which is why you've been snooping about and making enquiries late into the night, day after day? You realize that such skulking will only serve to paint you as the suspicious one, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Perhaps. But I can't solve this problem if I don't know its source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Seeing things first-hand with my own two eyes, and learning all that I can of them, is my deadliest weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So that's it, then. To think anyone would be foolish enough to enter our forest without permission! Such infraction cannot go unpunished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I must give due credit to Claris, though, for her honorable and upstanding behavior...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...yet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(What to do now?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Another late night. Ines must be asleep by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And Nasario advised me that it's improper to pay visit at such a late hour, so perhaps...I should just go. Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wait. Is that...Ines? Outside her lodgings?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Lady Ines, please return to your quarters! Going outside at this time is―</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Claris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ines? I told you to stay in your room. What's happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Claris... What should I do? Nasario hasn't returned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I told Nasario I was worried about you, so he left to check on matters and ensure everything is okay. But he hasn't come back since!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>He said he'd return quickly, too. It's all my fault. What should I do? What if something happened to him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Please, try to remain calm. You say he went to check on me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If that's the case, he may have gone to the forest. I'll ask the forest spirits if they know his location. This will take but a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Did they tell you? Something happened, didn't it?! We have to help him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No. You stay here with the guards, Ines. I'll go and help him myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The Divine Shelter cannot stand if conflict breaks out between high elves and humans, but if a human such as myself were to engage our foes, there should be no disturbance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What?! You expect me to wait on the sidelines while Nasario is in danger?! I...don't think I can! I'm coming with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You will be exposed to grave danger, both for yourself and for our two peoples. I cannot in all good conscience allow you to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Nasario went to find you in my stead because I was too afraid of what I might see if I went.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I am directly responsible for putting him in harm's way, so I must aid in his safe recovery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ines...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>And Claris, you said it yourself, no? Fear is birthed by the unknown, and defeated through knowledge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If I stay ignorant to the truths around me, I'll be scared for the rest of my life. So I have to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ines... What is that you're holding?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's an old charm of mine—a pressed flower. No matter how scary a situation I face, simply holding this in my hands always grants me courage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I suppose it's now my turn to grant you courage, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Come. Let's go rescue Nasario. Together.</td>
