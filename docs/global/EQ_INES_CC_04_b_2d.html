</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/claris.png" alt="Claris" height="128"><br>Claris</td>

<td>That aside, I must say your behavior of late has superseded your role as guide, and is causing some unease amongst the nobles.</td>

<td>Which is why you've been snooping about and making enquiries late into the night, day after day? You realize that such skulking will only serve to paint you as the suspicious one, no?</td>
