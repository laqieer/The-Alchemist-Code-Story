</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>You really are an amazing person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>You're right. The fortune telling I tried to do just now sharpened my senses. And by doing so, I gained the power to perceive things that normal people can't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>And now, I'm going to use this power. Because you helped me look at fortune telling in a positive light.</td>
