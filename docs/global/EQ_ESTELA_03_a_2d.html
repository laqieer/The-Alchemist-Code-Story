<td>Hyaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Urgh… Dammit…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Whew… We took care of that one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes. You saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Thank you very much. How are you feeling now, Amis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Good. Feeling better. I woke up soonafter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Then I heard you came back here to do a reading, so I came and checked on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Amis…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hey, Estella. Was the reading you were trying to do a little risky?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>As in…having a risk of harming yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Why…do you think that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If you're accustomed to attacks, you should normally be able to easily take down thugs like this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But something seemed wrong. Like you couldn't move freely or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Your power for fortune telling is amazing. That's why I wanted to rely on that power, to do whatever I could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But if there's a risk of injuring yourself... I can't ask you to do this. I shouldn't rely on you completely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Even though you're worried about the outcome of the ceremony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I know… But this is something I need to do for myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You really are an amazing person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You're right. The fortune telling I tried to do just now sharpened my senses. And by doing so, I gained the power to perceive things that normal people can't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And now, I'm going to use this power. Because you helped me look at fortune telling in a positive light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I want to see a brighter future. I want to support that cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You made me remember. Why I wanted to become a fortune teller.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But…for you to possibly get injured…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You were also going a little too far, all for your dreams, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I want to do my best, just like you. For my dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Estella…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Thank you for having my dreams return to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I think I should be the one saying thanks. I can't let you go too far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hm. Going too far for work sounds like you're talking about yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Fine… I get what you're saying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I want tomorrow's ceremony to be a success. For mechanical engineering... No. For the future of mankind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's what I need your help with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hold it right there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>…?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Drinking tea in plain sight as a bureau worker. How pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I didn't expect a traitor to just be wandering around the bureau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We were focused on security for the train that he almost got away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Grr…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You did all this… Why did you try to disrupt the whole ceremony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Why…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It should be obvious. Because it was supposed to be a grand stage for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I wanted to have the whole thing cancelled, but that would've caused a lot of problems. As I am also part of the Central Technology Bureau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You were nervous about the ceremony. If something bad had happened, you'd have a complete breakdown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But even though there was a sabotage, you made quick recoveries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>On top of that, they didn't expect fortune teller to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>…! Dammit…Well then…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'll have to make sure that you'll never see the ceremony come to fruition!</td>
</tr>
