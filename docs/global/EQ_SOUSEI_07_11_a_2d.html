<td>It's finished! This blade can do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>So you finished it...before sundown...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hahahah! What a simple mistake to make. How could I have misjudged my own strength?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It is indeed time for me to retire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Master Roh Ku...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No, I am just Roh now. Take this blade to Lord Kubera, my successor, Yna Ku.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hmm... However, not in your soot covered state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There is a change of clothes in the other room. Take it with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This is a time for urgency. Lord Kubera won't care about my appearance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Good grief. You never change. Listen here, Yna Ku.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What lies before you will be the greatest spectacle in the Avaritia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Everyone has done their best to do all that they can and make marks that will never fade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>And in the midst of all this, if a key figure was dressed shabbily, it would dampen the whole experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Very well then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This outfit is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ngh... Uckkk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What...are you doing? If you stay here...you'll be drawn...into the collapse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But leaving you here when your body isâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Fool! The collapse is fast approaching!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>My friend will assuredly dispatch of Mammon. But this is as far as I go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Master...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's why you must inherit...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Master, what's this box?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>A parting gift from me... Normally, you would have been given it when you came of age, but...it is... Ack! Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What are you doing? Go! We cannot allow the title of Ku that's been passed down for generations to end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>There is no one more suited to don my parting gift in this life than you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I shall wear this gratefully. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Now go. From now on, you are this region's greatest blacksmith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>There is no need for you to fear what others think. Take the path you wish to follow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Heh... That immature youngster has finally inherited my title.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Is this that emotion unbecoming of people born to this region?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I see... That much too kind man is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Lord Kubera!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So you've arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Those clothes... You've inherited your master's name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Brother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I have to go now, but I'll be back. All right, Benika?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Benika?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Thoughts have no power unless they take form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>R-right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Um, brother... I can fight, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Benika...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I decided to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I don't want to just be protected. I want to protect you, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I can fight! With the help of Luke... But still!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'm no longer the useless Benika you knew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Being with you, being able to save you... I decided that's the person I wanted to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Oh, Benika.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>All right. Let's go, Benika.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Right!</td>
