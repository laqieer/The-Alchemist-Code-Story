<td>Tsk! What is up with these monsters?! Compared to the ones I've encountered until now, they're on another level!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You should watch your back as well. These monsters tend to hide their presence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Agh! Of course, I know that! Don't state the obvious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I see. I apologize for my unnecessary actions.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Dang it! Saved by a Paladin!</td>

<td>As one who wields the art, you should understand the level of their abilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>These Paladins are the result of extensive research and training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The techniques of these elite, gathered from all across the continent, are second to none.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Lord Gabirond, are they that impressive? Even the Wratharis Alchemist that I took downâ€”</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They cannot wield the art without Philosopher's Stones. Will you compare us to those rebels?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You must have realized. Not one of the Paladins possesses a Philosopher's Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Of course. But, I don't either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>True. You appear to possess some degree of talent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>However, it is yet to be seen if you have as many Alchemia Particles as a Paladin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Alchemia Particles? Do you mean particles from the Philosopher's Stones?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Your studies appear to be insufficient regarding the mechanics of the art.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>All that have lived within the continent of Babel's long history possess Alchemia Particles within their body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Amongst them, there will rarely appear one who possesses an outstanding amount, allowing them to wield the art without a Philosopher's Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And they're the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Indeed. The Holy Guard is an institution made up of those from across the continent that possess an extraordinary amount of Alchemia Particles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>They are a selected breed, possessing raw qualities that separate them from others.</td>
</tr>

<td>A selected breed...</td>
