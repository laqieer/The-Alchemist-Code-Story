<td>After meeting up with his old childhood friend, Roxanne, in the bustling city of Slothstein...</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Siegfried's search for the truth behind Soren's would-be kidnappers lead him to Lustburg, where their former mentor resides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>As an expert in magic and Alchemy-related matters, she may be the best person to consult regarding Soren's mysterious powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Back on the road again, huh. Just like old times...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You make yourself sound *ancient*, Sieg. It's hard to believe we're the same age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm sure Teacher would be happy to see her little fledglings visit the nest again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>When you put it that way, Teach is kind of like a bird in some ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Like the time she caught wind of some exotic, shiny artifact from a traveling merchant and abandoned me right there in the plaza.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And she forgot to take you home, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't remind me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You... knew each other since you were kids?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Mm, more or less. We trained and lived with our teacher for a while, in Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sieg was there first. I escaped from my stuffy boarding school and ran into them while they were stopping by Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'd do anything to get out of there. It's not like I had family anymore, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You were the noisiest, most persistent girl I had ever come across.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Teacher took me in all the same. Guess she figured that I was better off with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Heh. That's true. After all, I didn't get along with the Holy Guard either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You were in the Holy Guard, Sieg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yeah. I'm an orphan. I guess they saw something in me and decided to recruit me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I wasn't cut out for that kind of life, though. Too many rules for my liking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh... I didn't know that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Now you do, kid. Good thing Teach came by and offered me a chance to study with her instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Look at us, a trio of wanderers with no family ties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Hmm... but this is just perfect! Our new family!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(Soren could pass as a child, and Sieg, of course, would be...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hehehe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Uh... Sieg? Roxanne is making a weird face...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Pay her no mind...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Anyway, eyes on the road, everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Roxanne and I used to train around hereâ€”and for good reason. We should be careful.</td>
