<td>Following their discoveries at the Lustberg ruins, Siegfried and his party gather at his former mentor Minerva's home to discuss their findings.</td>

<td>The "Alchemic Constructs," inorganic creations powered by Alchemia particles, had brought them one step closer to the mastermind's objectives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>After a week of recuperation and research, Minerva manages to mark out another area where similar ruins were rumored to be found.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's near Greed Dike, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes. One of my colleagues working there mentioned a small town on the outskirts that was said to harbor "strange energies."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>However, ever since it fell under the jurisdiction of a Greed Dike noble several years ago,</td>

<td>007</td>
<td>its folk legends have been labelled as pure fiction by the local governor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You think this might be the same kind of ruins as the one here in Lustburg, Teach?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I have good reason to believe so, yes.</td>

<td>He was able to procure a small sample of earth, and my tests have shown a higher than average concentration of Alchemia particles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This supports my theory that these facilities were, indeed, spread throughout the area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Unfortunately, he was unable to help me further, citing... "difficulties."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Difficulties, huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'd wager someone has beaten us to the ruins in search of the same objectives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It does mean we are on the right track, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Shall we make our way there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Soren, my dear. We will be heading once more into laboratory ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I know this is much to ask of you, but I would like if you could accompany us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We may be able to find more clues pertaining to your condition in the process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Umm... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Teach, you do know he passed out last time, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I put him to bed real early that night we came back, and he wouldn't stop mumbling in his sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh... I had a lot of weird dreams. I can't help but feel like they're familiar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Soren, you mentioned you simply woke up one day with no memory in Sakris Village next to the Construct, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Perhaps the Constructs and their origins are tied indelibly to the hazy past you've lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...Ultimately, though, I would like to leave the choice to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'll go. I've come this far, haven't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Everyone at Sakris Village wanted me to go with Sieg, and to find myself. I won't let them down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well, I can't say no to determination like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Atta boy, Soren. It's not going to be easy, but we're here for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Don't worry too much, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Thanks, everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well, we'd better get packing for the road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>And from here... it should only be another hour's travel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This is near the outskirts, so we should keep an eye out for bandits and monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Roger that.</td>
