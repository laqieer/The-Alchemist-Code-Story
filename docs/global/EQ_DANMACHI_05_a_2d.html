<td>Harrumph! Taking advantage of Bell's kindness, trying to wrap him around your little finger...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>And Bell's only helper being Little Miss Wallen-something?! Don't think I can't see what's going on here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Bell's been speaking rather highly of you since we met him, so I was wondering what kind of goddess you might be. Turns out you're quite the...uhh...spitfire?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ah, hahaha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wait a minute. Goddess, did you say Ais is my only helper?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Uh, yeah! That's what that high-and-mighty little diva from earlier said. Were you not listening to her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>All she told me was that she summoned "further help" from my world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Whaaat? She's got some nerve, sending you off to fight with such little info!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Did she at least tell you there's a minotaur here, and it's growing in strength?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So it is a minotaur, then! She didn't tell me that part, specifically, but I did at least know there was a monster here gaining power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hoo boy. Why am I not surprised?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I pried as much information from her as I could, but I'm betting you just agreed to help the second you heard there were people in trouble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hahaha. You know me too well, Goddess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Heh. That's how it goes with friends, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Looks like you've found yourself some nice companions in this world, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I have. I already count both Kevin and Ila here as dear friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hmm. Short one this time. Where's your usual "I can't stand it"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You're the one I can't stand, remember?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hahaha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What about you, Wallen-something? Did you hear about any of this when you were brought here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yeeeeah, that's what I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well, defeating a minotaur that's absorbed that much power with a party this small might be kind of a tall order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You know exactly how powerful it is? Did that observer of destiny woman give you that much detail?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh, no, I guess I forgot to mention! I got captured by some real sketchy guys earlier, and they had the minotaur with them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>At first it seemed like they had it under their control, but then it started to go kinda berserk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>So we're dealing with an enraged monster from another world that's been feeding on Alchemia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh, yeah, it's on a total rampage of destruction. That place looked like ruins to begin with, but the minotaur made sure nobody'll ever be able to tell what it used to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The children who weren't able to get away in time... They could be in there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Goddess, do you happen to remember where those ruins were?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Raaaaaarrrgggh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We'd best wrap this up and be on our way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hey! Wait your turn! Rude beast. They're over that way, Bell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Okay! Then let's move out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What are you people doing here?! ...Ahhh, if it isn't our runaway test subject!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Waaah! Bell, those are the guys who captured me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hahaha! Our lab might be destroyed, but as long as we can get our hands back on the test subject, our power in battle is assured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Grr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>How dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We're putting a stop to your whole operation right now!</td>
</tr>
