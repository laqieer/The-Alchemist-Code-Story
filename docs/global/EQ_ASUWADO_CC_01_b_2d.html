<td>Nonetheless, I feel like I'm always causing you trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>Your assassination techniques are so intricate and beautiful. I can't hold a candle to that. I've still so much to learn.</td>
</tr>

<td>Faltering in the face of your target is not at all unusual. Don't let it get to you. You'll improve with time.</td>

<td>Thank you! Hearing such words of encouragement from the great Lady Najam is truly heartening indeed!</td>
</tr>

<td>Don't get so worked up. I'm no better than you are. We're roughly the same age, we come from the same place—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>We're not the same at all! Yes, it's true that we're both orphans recruited by the order, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>But you stood out right away! I mean, you've already attained the top rank, earning the title "Hand of Darkness"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>We all revere and respect you. You've never failed a mission, not even once! You successfully execute your target every time, no matter who they may be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>You pursue Zalam Gaim's ideals, while at the same time holding yourself to a seemingly impossible standard. You're absolutely a role model to us all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>We all look up to you like the bright star you are, Lady Najam.</td>
</tr>

<td>We bestow upon you the name Najam, meaning "star." This name denotes a position of merit and authority within the assassins' order of Zalam Gaim.</td>
</tr>

<td>Bear that name as you work to the order's benefit, and know that as long as your fulfill your duties, our door will ever be open to you.</td>

<td>How can you—?</td>

<tr>
<td>Dahab</td>
<td>Excuse me. Terribly sorry for the interruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Dahab? What's an intermediary doing all the way out here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dahab</td>
<td>I come bearing your next mission. And this one's a priority. You are to postpone all others until its completion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>
<td>You want us to put off our current mission? But isn't completing jobs in the order received a rather important part of our creed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>Yeah, Zalam Gaim's doctrines state that all deaths are equal, so assigning any one value over another is strictly forbidden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>Of course, we subvert the universal equality of death by interfering with the natural order, but we offset this by working within our own strict rule set.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>Surely, of all people, an intermediary should know this best! It's a basic tenet of the order, after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dahab</td>
<td>Ah, but Zalam Gaim's creed also states that assassins aren't permitted to turn down any mission the intermediary presents them, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dahab</td>
<td>So I'd rather appreciate it if you two simply obeyed and took the assignment without any further question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dahab</td>
<td>That's better. Now, your target is to be the guild captain of the Desert Wings, Ryle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>
<td>I don't suppose we get to hear why he gets special treatment, do we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dahab</td>
<td>There is no need for you to know that information. Just make sure that he dies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>Positively shameful! How dare he take that tone when speaking to you? And to ask us to postpone our assignment, no less!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>
<td>Pay it no mind. As I understand it, he was raised in the aristocracy. In his eyes, I'm sure we're little more than filthy orphans. It's remarkable he even gives us the time of day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>But, Lady Najam...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>So...will you accept this mission, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>Despite it running counter to one of the founding tenets of our doctrines? Should we not at least check the validity of this request with the Great Master?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>
<td>The Great Master has fallen gravely ill, and should not be disturbed with such trifles. For now, we must do as we always have: complete our mission as assigned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>
<td>The intermediary holds rank over us. It is our duty to do as instructed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>
<td>That is equally a founding tenet of Zalam Gaim. And it's those tenets that made the order what it is today.</td>
