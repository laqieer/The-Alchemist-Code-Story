<td>Urgh!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What's the matter, usurper? Has your contract run its course already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No! I can...keep going...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(I've got to. But I've already gone through three offerings...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(Pain, taste, and touch. If you should lose any more of yourself, it may interfere with your ability to fight.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(If you were a dragon, or even a Fallen, you could manage. But as a human, you lack the fortitude that's required.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It looks like you've exhausted all of your options. Now is the time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>For you to be gone from my sight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ghh... Adhere to the...Dark—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Curses! She...hit my...lungs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Offering your ability to feel pain has led you to suffer tremendous physical damage without knowing it. You must stop this. You won't be able to survive much more punishment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>"I am Transcender of the Gate of Pride!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>And so the Child of God has come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's right. I'm here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I've still got a score to settle with you, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Took you...long enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Sorry about that. But we fight together now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Inconceivable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Nimul, bearer of the recreation of humanity's future... Why have you brought others into your struggle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You have the power to realize your every whim—to change the Truth of the world as you see fit, and take whatever form you wish within that Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No other has power that even comes close to yours. No others need be involved with your struggle. So, why have you chosen to subject them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You should have figured that out by now, Ouroboros. Despite everything you can do, your perspective is awfully limited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Pardon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No matter how much power I obtain, this simply isn't something I can do on my own. Nothing new will be born from my will alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Differing opinions and fresh perspectives have always been the driving force behind all of human progress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It is you who lack understanding in these matters, Child of God. Novelty and perspective are irrelevant. Perfection requires neither.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The ultimate form of this world is a perfect circle, spinning as instructed on a singular axis—under a singular will. Further axes only lead to instability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If all that's true, Ouroboros, then why are you not alone? Why do you require others to do your bidding?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The one known as Bianca is similar to you, is she not? And yet, very different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But I believe she shares the same origin as you. And if that's the case, it begs the question:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Why does she exist? Are you not the perfect, complete being? Are you not the singular axis upon which the world spins?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I do not know the intentions of the dragons that created us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But if your assertion is that I am incomplete...that I alone am not enough to serve as god to this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Then I shall show you evidence to the contrary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>My name is Ouroboros—Ouroboros Legacy. I represent the will of the old world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Long ago, the dragons created a canopy for the world, to prolong the life of all its creatures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yet despite its protection, this world is now coming to an end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Know that by surpassing me, you are surpassing the once-prosperous world itself, for that is I!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ugh! The magil is too dense. Our attacks can't get through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>"Adhere to the dark commandments!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...I can barely withstand this. I won't be able to keep it up much longer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'll clear a path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wait! Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Am I understanding correctly that every time you use that ability, you have to sacrifice some part of yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That's a heavy burden to bear, and you don't need to bear it alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I am your attendant, though, am I not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That was my responsibility at the start of it all. And even now, it is the one thing I truly take pride in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Waginau...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Now's not the time to hesitate, Nimul! Go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(Zafeiris!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(You wish to fight once more? Very well. State your pledge.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(It seems my lady already knows that her power never matched that which the dragons once possessed, and she understands the implications of that fact.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(I'll give up half of my world. I will pledge my right eye.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That is certainly sufficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Here. Take this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...! This is... Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>"Adhere to the dark commandments!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>"Devour all that impedes our path!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Nimul! Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>"I am Transcender of the Seven Gates!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...Did... Did we do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It landed, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Most amusing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>The very moment this world is to meet its end, an adversary with the power to actually wound me suddenly appears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yet, you are still inadequate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>No...! Her magil output is increasing even further!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>The wall of corruption that separates the regions of this world...is now a part of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I am the last and most fearsome Cursed Beast of them all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>So tell me, human. Do you truly have the conviction to bear all the sins of this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>It's all corruption...as far as the eye can see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Augh! My body's being...swallowed?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Want... I want...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Envy... Wrath... Lust... Gluttony... Greed... Sloth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Why...won't you...succumb...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I've thought about this so much. How many times have I cursed this world for its unfair, unjust ways?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>How could I possibly stand to see the world end on such a low note...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>...without fighting to make it better?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>That light...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>"Save us, the lost souls!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>That voice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>That's Emmel! Even now, she's still protecting the tower!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Which means...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>She's still giving this her best effort. And as her older brother, I need to make sure I do my part, too, so that effort isn't in vain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Hmm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ouroboros...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I'm going to take this world from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ah... I see you've taken back the tower. But what do you think such pointless struggling can possibly accomplish at this late stage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>"The Power of Alchemy is not solely for creating wealth!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>"In other words, my soul will become a new, refined extreme!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>This is the Dragon Realm! How could a human...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>The seven Cursed Beasts who serve as the tower's foundation have granted me their power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Hmph. Even with a Dragon Realm at your disposal, nothing can help you overcome the difference in power between us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You're right. There's no way that I alone could ever gain enough power to defeat you. You are, after all, the very world itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>And that's why we're all going to fight you as one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>All of you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Yes. All of the people I've met on my journey. Those I've seen eye-to-eye with, and those I haven't. Those I could save, and those I couldn't. I call upon them all now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>To each and every one of you...I give my gold, that you may hear my plea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Alchemy isn't something I ever meant to keep for myself. From the very start, I wanted it to be a resource available to every single person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>And once everyone had learned it, and mastered it, I'd hoped they could use it to make the world a better place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>What sheer absurdity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Do you know what will come of you should you freely give out the Truth—the Wisdom you've gained?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You will no longer be able to function as a vessel. You will lose your sense of self, distributing it among countless others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>And what of it? I'll do whatever it takes to change this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>World, hear my ideals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>It's been a while since Nimul and the others set out for Superbia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>And the world seems to be changing rapidly, all of a sudden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Is that why we've been summoned here, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>The Fallen throughout all the regions have become a lot more active of late, and I'd really prefer not to leave this Belt Region if at all possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Are you implying that this is because of what's happening in Superbia Belt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>...! Could it be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>The barrier of corruption is thinning. Someone is consuming the sinful magil filling the world, which is causing the uptick in Fallen activity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>The sinful magil is as vital to the Fallen as the air we breathe is to us. Without it, they cannot exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>So what you're saying is, the Fallen are starting to run out of air and are at risk of suffocating, which is causing them to rampage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Precisely. Aren't you a smart cookie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Okay. I understand the problem, then, but what can we do about it? Why did you call us here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>What Nimul's embarked on is truly something big. So big, in fact, that he'll constantly be in need of more people to help till it's over and done with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Are we to go assist him, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>With the barrier of corruption as fragile as it is, now might be the best time to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>If I draw upon the crystallized magil of this region—the Stone of the Gods—I can use Space-Time Manipulation to get us to Superbia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Thing is, if I did that, I'd also be exhausting the area's source of magil, which would have...consequences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>There's not really any point to the town floating in the air anymore. It shouldn't be that much of an issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Are you sure about that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Nimul says he wants to change this world. I believe in him, so I want to do what I can to chip in from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Besides, this is a land of science and engineering. We've been researching technology to help the island get along even without magil, though we haven't exactly been public about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Minario seemed so confident, and it really motivated me to join this effort...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>But this battle has become so much harder than anyone had ever imagined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Don't spread yourself too thin, Sulva. We're all working together here. Being part of a team means we help cover one another's shortcomings. We'll make it through this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Yeah. Yeah, you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Ire and Invidia are allies now, and if that can happen, anything is possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>How are you holding up, Ambrosia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Not well, if I'm being honest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>My magic isn't doing squat here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Direct attacks don't seem so effective, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Ambrosia! That's a phantom built from past memories, made through Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Regular techniques are just gonna bounce right off of it like they're nothing! That's why you can't seem to hit it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Ah, now that you mention it, weren't the dragons much the same way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Do you have a plan for dealing with it, Ambrosia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>If I did, you think our Belt Region would've been destroyed by the Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Ain't gonna stop me from trying, though! "Space-Time Manipulation: Ignition!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>That won't do a thing. You're wasting your efforts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Well, live and learn, I guess. Mira! Nyx! How've you been fighting this joker?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Alchemy! We've been using Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>We got the power from Nimul. It directly manipulates the target itself, so we can ignore their magil density.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>If you aren't going to present any challenge, then you're worthless. Begone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Agh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Winnick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I... I will fight! Fight! ...Fight...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>No matter the cost...I must protect... What am I protecting? What is it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Aaaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Urk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>She's so powerful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Let's go, Mira, Nyx! We'll join, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Right! We've gotta keep at it! There's no time to stand around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>If we all focus our attacks together, it should have some effect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>It sounds like you're having a hard time. Thank you for letting me know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Everyone's out there fighting, giving their all. There's got to be something I can do to help...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>――...――......――</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Huh? What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>This voice doesn't sound like the spirits. Wait, I think I've heard this voice somewhere before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Isn't it...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>It's rare to see you so languid, Eulalia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>...Julia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Yes. It's been such a long time, hasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Are we in...Sephira Village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>We are not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>We are inside your mind. The injuries you've been dealt by that woman named Matia are tormenting your very soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>I see. So this is how the sinful magil comes to be. It's created inside of us all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Precisely. It is born from within each and every one of us. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Hear my ideals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>He can teach you how to dispel it. He will show you the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Give me your hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>A-all right. I hadn't wanted to rely on you, after you died. It just didn't feel right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>But I'm sure observing what's happening to the world must be unbearable even for those who've already departed it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>No, no, no! It's not enough! I need more! More! More!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>We can't...let it end here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Wait. What's that sound?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>"I am the priestess of the Forest of Suga. I hear the voices of the skies, the winds, and the earth."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>...And I'll be relying on that halberd of yours, one last time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>This is our first time crossing paths. I am from a line of once renowned soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>And I cannot even bear to look at you, traitor. Therefore, I shall cut you down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>I am Julia of the Forest of Suga, Protector of Sephira and descendant of your line. And this is to be your final stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Who...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>She's an ally. Would you lend us your aid in battle, Julia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>I would be honored, Eulalia. Let us ready our counteroffensive!</td>
</tr>
