<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Hey, why did you become a Paladin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Because I wanted to save the world, of course. I assume everyone here has the same wish. You feel the same, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yeah. I also love being in this gathering of goody two-shoes so much I can't stop smiling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm complimenting you. Just accept it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Believing in an ideal and sticking with it is a gift.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(I'm jealous that they wholeheartedly think they wanna save people.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(Everyone here says the same thing. Their eyes are shining with it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Well, I guess these are the kind of things newbie Paladins talk about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Is that guy's hair pink? We've got some flashy haired people around here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh, that's Magnus. He's amazing. I heard they poached him from the Wratharis army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm sure he gave up his position in the army in order to become a Paladin and protect the world, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh. ...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He just...yawned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're so impressive! You used to be in the Wratharis army, right? I heard you were headhunted directly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's not that impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No, I think it's interesting, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What's with you? You came out of nowhere. It really isn't interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No, there's something interesting about it, all right. You going out of your way to join Holy Order is really something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You should make more fuss about that. You should be bragging that you're a Alchemy genius.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Although, I guess being a genius isn't rare here, what with the Holy Guard drawing in geniuses from all over the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You'd get a better salary ascending the ranks in the army, though, right? So why'd you join the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Come ooon, tell me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What's with you? Are you trying to start a fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No way. I'm just having fun. I like talking to people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Come on, you can relax around me. You have to have fun in the present; no one knows what the future might hold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I promise that talking to me won't be as boring as talking to the goody-goodies, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You're kind of a pain, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>People tell me that all the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Fine. Let's make a bet, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>If you draw this ace of hearts, I'll be buddy buddy with you. Simple, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Gambling, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You're not good at gambling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's not that; I just don't like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But I kind of like that you've got the guts to cheat so brazenly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Well well well, I'm surprised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You're the first to see through my sleight of hand. Didn't think you'd stay sharp-eyed even over something so inconsequential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hahaha! I like you! You're really not a boring goody two-shoes, just like I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Seems like things are going to get a little more interesting around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oi, you over there! What are you flapping your gums over?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh crap!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Lounging around right before the first day of training...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I came here to be your instructor and I won't tolerate such behavior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oi, you two! Come talk to me after training!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Damn, he's going to be keeping an eye on us from now. I meant to lay low in the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>My condolences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>He's going to be watching you, too, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But this makes things more interesting, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You're a troublemaker, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>People tell me that all the time, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Shall we stir up some trouble, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hey now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I'm just joking. Let's work up a sweat, shall we?</td>
