<td>Holy Guard New Recruit A</td>
<td>Hey, why did you become a Paladin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Guard New Recruit B</td>
<td>Because I wanted to save the world, of course. I assume everyone here has the same wish. You feel the same, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/wilh.png" alt="Wilhelm" height="128"><br>Wilhelm</td>
<td>Yeah. I also love being in this gathering of goody two-shoes so much I can't stop smiling.</td>

<td>Holy Guard New Recruit A</td>
<td>What's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/wilh.png" alt="Wilhelm" height="128"><br>Wilhelm</td>
<td>I'm complimenting you. Just accept it.</td>

<td>Holy Guard New Recruit A</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/wilh.png" alt="Wilhelm" height="128"><br>Wilhelm</td>
<td>(I'm jealous that they wholeheartedly think they wanna save people.)</td>

<td>Is that guy's hair pink? We've got some flashy haired people around here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Guard New Recruit B</td>
<td>Oh, that's Magnus. He's amazing. I heard they poached him from the Wratharis army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Guard New Recruit B</td>
<td>I'm sure he gave up his position in the army in order to become a Paladin and protect the world, too.</td>

<td>It's not that impressive.</td>

<td>No, I think it's interesting, too.</td>

<td>What's with you? You came out of nowhere. It really isn't interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/wilh.png" alt="Wilhelm" height="128"><br>Wilhelm</td>
<td>No, there's something interesting about it, all right. You going out of your way to join Holy Order is really something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/wilh.png" alt="Wilhelm" height="128"><br>Wilhelm</td>
<td>You should make more fuss about that. You should be bragging that you're a Alchemy genius.</td>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/wilh.png" alt="Wilhelm" height="128"><br>Wilhelm</td>

<td>Come ooon, tell me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>What's with you? Are you trying to start a fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/wilh.png" alt="Wilhelm" height="128"><br>Wilhelm</td>
<td>No way. I'm just having fun. I like talking to people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/wilh.png" alt="Wilhelm" height="128"><br>Wilhelm</td>
<td>Come on, you can relax around me. You have to have fun in the present; no one knows what the future might hold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/wilh.png" alt="Wilhelm" height="128"><br>Wilhelm</td>
<td>I promise that talking to me won't be as boring as talking to the goody-goodies, at least.</td>

<td>!</td>

<td>If you draw this ace of hearts, I'll be buddy buddy with you. Simple, right?</td>
</tr>

<td>Gambling, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Well well well, I'm surprised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>
