<td>Amane, watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What do you think you're doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Don't try to fool me. You're trying to kill me, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well, not if I kill you first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>W-wait! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke! What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Stop! What are you all thinking?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hold it. Don't jump in on this one. You'll just get mixed up in it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke. Is this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yeah. There's only one thing it can be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hidden Ogres.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I get it now. That's what they were doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That was the reason for the demon attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>They intended to station Hidden Ogres within the Blade Fox and destroy us from the inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>How horrible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi, what should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Do you even need to ask? We're taking this place back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Conflict or killing within the Corps is strictly prohibited. No exceptions. So we're not going to take this one lying down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This level of deceit, though! We're going to have to be a lot more vigilant from now on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And I'm certainly not planning on letting the Blade Fox fall before the lady of the hour returns. I'd never be able to face her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Understood, Captain Ugachi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Interesting. When she's not around, he can't stop thinking about her, can he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Just one more reason to like you, Captain Ugachi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Shut your mouth! We have no time to lose here. First things first, we need to quell this distrust among the troops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If they don't listen to reason, they're useless. Disable them so they can't get in our way, then find and destroy those Hidden Ogres.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>They really think a cowardly plan like this is enough to stop the Blade Fox? We won't be beaten so easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The Blade Fox are made of sterner stuff than that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Now, let's get moving!</td>
