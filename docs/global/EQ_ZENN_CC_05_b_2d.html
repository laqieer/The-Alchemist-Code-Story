<td>(My eyes are so heavy.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(I hope I haven't slept in, or Mitsu will be furious with me... I have to get up. Why am I so tired?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(That's strange... It doesn't feel like I'm in my bed. Where am I? Where are Mitsu and Aya?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(My face feels like it's on fire... I hope I don't have a fever. Mitsu's going to kill me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(I'm trying so hard to open my eyes, but...I can barely see.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Your name is also a form of meditation. They say it's like having your eyes opened for the first time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Have you heard of zen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I have. It's conducted in a sort of ceremony, isn't it? You meditate to explore the depths of your soul...or something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I suppose that's not too far off. You focus your mind to attune yourself to the truth. To attain enlightenment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Truth? What sort of truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I believe it's knowledge—knowledge of the path to paradise. It's complicated...even I don't fully understand it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Y-you don't?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, that's only to be expected. It's impossible to understand this truth without first attaining enlightenment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Just as you cannot persuade fire to freeze and snow to burn, just as you cannot touch the surface of the moon while you stand on the ground below...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You cannot comprehend the ultimate truth without enlightenment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Y-you've lost me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hmhm. I'm lost, too, of course—but that's just it. We can only search for knowledge that we have yet to possess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>All of us seek truth, in our own way. Where does the soul reside? What is the nature of the heart? What is the meaning of life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Personally, I think you have just embarked on your own journey of discovery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Once you were satisfied with proclaiming yourself a tool. An instrument of another's will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Now you seek to become something more, and as you fumble around blindly for your truth, you have found me treasures the likes of which I never thought to possess. Warmth, happiness...love. A normal life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I would never have thought to change, if it wasn't for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Perhaps...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>There's no doubt about it. If we hadn't met, I would have been stuck there for the rest of my days. Unthinking, uncaring...stagnant. Like a blade left to rust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You really were a pathetic, cowardly excuse for a samurai, weren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I was...but then you opened my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I knew I'd find you here, she-devil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Haa...haa... I might be injured...but slaughtering you will be only too easy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You twisted him... You took him away from me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>And now you will die, shrine maiden!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Aha...hahaha...hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>And what's so funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ungh... Ahahah...haha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>A-answer me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hee hee hee! Aha! Hahaha! Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Didn't you hear me?! I said, answer me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Mitsu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Mitsu...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Me? Me-too? Mi...mi...mi...mi...mi... Mimi! Ahahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What the hell is wrong with her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I can heal the body, but the mind and heart will remain broken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>How can she laugh, when her daughter lies dead?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>And that is worst of all. There is nothing I can do for a shattered spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>She...broke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I am able to heal others by projecting their wounds onto my spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Aha! Haha? Ahaha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>She tried to project Aya's death onto her spirit...and it broke her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I can't do that with death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Her body lives on, but her spirit...her heart...her mind... They have...perished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Ha-ha! Ahaha! Ahaha...ack! Hrk! Hrgh! Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I...doubt she will ever be the same again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What? But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Nnnf...! Blgh! Bleeeeegh! Nngh...heh...hehe... Hee hee hee! Hahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I-I... I never... This wasn't what I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Na Zhu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>She was the enemy, so I... I just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You just did what you've always done. What I used to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You drew your sword without a second thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It's a natural impulse in times of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>All this time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Oh? Does this go back to "victory is won in the sheath"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>My existence is akin to the quick-drawn blade. I am always stationed where I am needed, and there I wait, like a sheathed blade, for my target to appear. The moment they do, I draw my katana, and with their swift death, I retreat. It is a skill that ensures my survival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Distance and positioning are everything in Iai.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Being able to perceive the exact distance at which you can strike your enemy without being in reach of their attacks enables you to cut them down the moment you unsheathe your sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Of course, enemies who are aware of this technique are unlikely to get too close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Your intention was to keep your katana sheathed? Because you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Only for my own satisfaction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>D-draw your katana!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>If you want to kill me, go ahead. I won't stop you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Don't you hate me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I destroyed your family! I robbed you of half your sight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I cooked for you, because I wanted us to be a family. I wanted to make something you'd enjoy—something that would make you feel at home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>But that day...everything went cold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>This is my way of getting back at you for that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>No... You're just doing your job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Don't you see?! I'm a worthless piece of trash! I've killed more people than I can count, and yet this one tragedy fills me with useless pity!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I'm a heartless bastard! I lack the imagination to predict the consequences of my own actions! I don't even have the guts to complete this one, lousy mission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I've worn my patriotic heart on my sleeve, and used it as an excuse to exterminate the weak like vermin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>So I don't have the right to wallow in guilt, or think sweet thoughts of penitence! It's far, far too late for me to develop a conscience now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Not after I ruined the woman who once saved my life! Not after I destroyed everything you held dear! Not after all the death I've caused without a single pang of regret!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>So scream at me! Tell me I deserve death! Tell me to rot in hell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Why? Why won't you say it?! Is it because I didn't apologize?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Na Zhu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Why doesn't anyone ever get angry at me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Why does everyone I meet end up avoiding me, like a puddle of vomit on the road?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Na Zhu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Emperor Orion wasn't afraid to run me through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Even you nearly killed me once. But you also encouraged me, praised my talents! You denied my beliefs, with my best interests at heart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>So why are you silent now?! Tell me to shut up and stop being selfish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Tell me that it's repugnant for me to complain of an aching heart after murdering all those people! Tell me that you find my attachment to you vile!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Tell me that I'm a worthless piece of trash! Tell me that you despise me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Because there's nothing I can ever do to make this right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You and I have something in common.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>We both find life easier as tools.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Tools that exist only to serve another's will. For that luxury, we would turn our backs on our true nature, our own heart and will, and become blind to the abuses occurring around us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I was willing to do what I was told because it was my job. Because it was my duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>And yet...I realized that I didn't want you to end up making the same mistakes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>We need to eat to survive, and we need to kill to eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Prey doesn't survive, but predators do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I didn't know how to resolve these ideas within myself, so I simply ran away. I abandoned my troubles, my duty...and you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>This is the consequence of that choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Nonetheless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I am grateful to you for sparing my wife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I-I... I...! I don't understand. Wh-why? Why are you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>B-but... Wh-what am I supposed to do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>That's why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I've decided I'm going to remain faithful this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I won't turn my back on my heart again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>How disgraceful.</td>
</tr>
