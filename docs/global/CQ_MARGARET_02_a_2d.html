<td>All my cures are made with love! They are of the finest quality! Don't forget to dote upon your vendor, the oh so lovely merchant, Little Miss Margaret!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey! Little Miss Margaret! Come over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ladies and gentlemen! Thank you so much for coming to see my wares today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We're the ones who should be thanking you! You're the one who came to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(It's been a few hours since I arrived and started selling my wares. The cures are flying off my cart pretty much as fast as I expected!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Whew... I'm so tired...but I managed to sell all of my stock! Lizzy will be ever so—hmmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I thought this village was suffering from an epidemic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Tee hee hee! Well, you see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The oh so lovely merchant, Little Miss Margaret, treated everyone to some of her amazing cures! For a fair price, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>They shouldn't have been able to recover so quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Tee hee! Hee hee hee! Well, you see... Allow me to—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You have meddled here today, you...frivolous peddler.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Did I do something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(Other than set my prices a little higher than usual... Tee hee.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's all but impossible for me to observe the pathogen now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>W-wait, what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Tch. My experiment has come to naught.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Experiment...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I attempted the same experiment in a different village several years ago. Since then I have spent my time improving the strain, but all my efforts have now been wasted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>However, for it to be cured so swiftly and easily... It must not be ready. It will take some time and tweaking before I am able to present it to the queen as a weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hello! Nice to meet you! The name's Elizabeth. You're going to be my test subject from today. I'm looking forward to working with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I-is this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's right! This is my laboratory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Your village is in a bit of a rough spot, right? That new illness is spreading like wildfire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Y-yes, it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey! It's going to be all right. I will find the cure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Just leave it to me! I'll make sure you can go home someday soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>S-so...it was never an illness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>An epidemic is not a mere illness. It is truly astonishing that you were able to cure it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I bet you had an accomplice...even if an unwilling one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Tut-tut. I have been flapping my tongue for long enough. Perhaps I will make you my accomplice, since you have learned so much of my plans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ahahahah! If you're talking about experiments, I've had enough of those, thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Thinking of running away? You're looking a little unsteady on your feet, my dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hey! Hey! Keep your eyes up here, mister! Nobody appreciates that kind of attention!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm tired from selling my wares, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Give me a break, all right? Just cool it.</td>
