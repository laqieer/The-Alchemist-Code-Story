<td>001</td>
<td>I've arrived...how nostalgic. Yet, I can no longer feel such emotions. This is the place I once called home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The ruins of Wratharis nobleman Gadd Nash's manor...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Father, it's time for your medicine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ah, thank you, Dias. And you too, Yuffie. You too really get along well, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yeah! Because I need to protect Yuffie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I see. You're still thinking about that village, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Don't worry. No one will hurt you anymore. Dario and I will protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Because you came to that village, father, Yuffie and I weren't separated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I promise to pay back the debt I owe you for taking me and Yuffie in! That's why I want you to get better quickly, father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Thank you, both of you. Ah, the amount of medicine seems to be increasing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Father, can I have a moment? Sir Crowley is here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh! Captain Zeke, let him in right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Understood. Dias, Yuffie, come here. Thanks for bringing the medicine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>All I did was carry the medicine that you bought, Dario. You don't need to thank me for that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Dias, you're a good kid. Ah. Need to bring in the guests. Say hello to Lord Crowley.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ni-nice to meet you! My name is Dias. This is my sister, Yuffie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yuffie can't speak. Please forgive the rudeness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. You two have very clever-looking faces. Logi, introduce yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm Logi Crowley. Nice to meet you, Dias! Yuffie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well, we'll take our leave then. We don't want to push father too hard. Please look after him, Lord Crowley.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ah. Gladly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>How are you feeling, Lord Gadd?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Thank you for coming all this way. I don't think it's anything serious, but my age is my age...and I don't seem to show any sign of healing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If I were to lose you, Lord Gadd, it will have quite the adverse effect on the recovering Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This may be a cruel wish, but, for the sake of the people, I do wish you live long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Heheh. I never thought I would hear such kind words from the man once feared as the Blood Wolf Zeke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Have no fear. If I were to die, there is still Dario. This land will remain at peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Dario is young, but he has studied in Northern Pride and he now uses those personal connections to assist in the reconstruction of our country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Captain Zeke, please look after my sons. Never would I wish for a tragedy like the Dawn of Wrath to repeat itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Lord Gadd...if only all of Wratharis' nobility were such as you are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Lord Crowley...he seems dignified yet kind at the same time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh! The buds are sprouting out, Yuffie! You've been watering them properly, after all. I'm sure they'll blossom into beautiful flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm really looking forward to it too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(These days of calm... They made me forget how twisted and ugly the world could be.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(Because of my naivety...Yuffie...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Argh! The Holy Guard found us...huh? It's just one of them! Kill him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The regret you have sown here...shall be paid for in the next life!</td>
</tr>
