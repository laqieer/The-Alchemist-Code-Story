<td>Here, mister! The accessory you asked for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>My, why thank you, Celliers! My wife will be over the moon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Are these all new pieces? They're all so wonderful! Just looking at them soothes my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Eh heh heh, and don't you forget it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Mielikki, hush!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>All the crystals here are super special. Celliers worked extra, extra hard on them, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh, then what're you the one bragging for, Mielikki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Whatta you expect, I'm proud to call Celliers my friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Besides, I'm as big a fan of his crystals as anyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>True, there is something special about Celliers' crystals. Craftsmanship like that is sure to bring anyone good fortune.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Right you are. Ever since I decorated my shop with ornaments Celliers made, more customers have been coming in... Maybe they have some sort of power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>S-surely you exaggerate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Am I? I'm serious, you really are amazing. More people have started coming to our remote hamlet, guided by your crystals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The village is more lively than ever, thanks to you, Celliers. You have our gratitude, truly you do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I second that sentiment! Selling them to peddlers has spread talk of your crystal craftsmanship far and wide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>At this rate, you could even become the greatest crystal craftsman in all of Babel! Keep up the good work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You hear that, Celliers?! The greatest crystal craftsman in Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>K-knock it off, already. The business world isn't so lenient. I don't know a thing about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So, too, do I lack common knowledge. It's hard for me to talk with customers who come from the outside world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Even now, I'm just getting by with the help of you and the villagers, Mielikki. Without you, I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well no worries on that front. After all, you and I will be together forever, Celliers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I've got a front-row seat to all your hard work. We're in this together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Mielikki...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Still, no need to be so impatient. That old geezer said to take your time, didn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...Yeah, you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The people who hurt me are long gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>"All those related to the experiment have been exposed." That's what Michael said when he came to check up on me, after that incident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>"You're safe now, live your own life. Take it slow—look to the future, don't let your awful past bind you."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's why I want to make my way in this village, one way or another. I may be inexperienced now, but if I work a little harder...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh! Y-yes, sir! What can I do for you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Can you show me your crystals?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>My cry—? Oh, r-right. Our current selection is everything you see here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That customer also came from outside the village. He just bolted after a bit of window shopping... Think he's broke or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Who can say...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, that reminds me, Mielikki. What even brought you here today? Was there something you needed, or...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's right! Yeah! I came to get you, Celliers. Come on, follow me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wha—hey, you're gonna yank my arm off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Tah-daaah! Behold, my flower bed! Look at all my beautiful blooms!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Whoa, you're not kidding... They're so beautiful. And so big, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I've seen these before, in a book. "Crystal flowers"... Rare specimens whose petals glisten like crystal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But these flowers are incredibly difficult to raise, if I recall...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Is that right? I just gave them some TLC—plus a reasonable amount of water—and they turned pretty as a picture!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Wow... You really are incredible when it comes to growing flowers, Mielikki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ah jeez, back again already?! I guess they really must smell a treat. Always attracting the wrong kind of admirers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Shoo! Stay away from my flower bed, you!</td>
</tr>
