<td>What?! The Mikaboshi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>It's been taken from the inner sanctum. Based on the techniques used in its extraction, I believe the perpetrators must be from Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Which raises the question: Are you familiar with a swordfighter who uses ink techniques?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Of course, reasons for clinging to the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi are few, in terms of mass appeal. There's simply not value in it for the general populace to warrant any grave concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>And it has no effect on me personally, either, as I have no connection with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>However... I believe its absence will have quite an impact on you, no?</td>

<td>I must apologize to you, Judius. Some of this was due to my own clumsiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>We've already lost the Sacred Stone Mammon. Without even the Mikaboshi now, Greed Dike will be unable to continue holding the other nations back. So this is not merely my problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zex.png" alt="Zechs" height="128"><br>Zechs</td>
<td>Yes, yes, of course. However, we can hear it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zex.png" alt="Zechs" height="128"><br>Zechs</td>
<td>The cries of a new Mammon, coming ever closer.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zex.png" alt="Zechs" height="128"><br>Zechs</td>
<td>With your plan falling through, however, that would mean all that research and development has just been a waste of time for Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zex.png" alt="Zechs" height="128"><br>Zechs</td>
<td>And you wouldn't want that, now, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>Of course not! Without my research, we could never have achieved military rule in the kingdom. Even Orion couldn't pull that off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>I'm quite proud of what my research has accomplished, I'll have you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zex.png" alt="Zechs" height="128"><br>Zechs</td>
<td>Then prove it. If you wish to live in Greed Dike, you must do everything you can for the good of this nation.</td>
</tr>

<td>...Yes, I believe that was implied from the start of this conversation.</td>

<td>When I was young, my parents were cheated by someone they thought to be a trusted friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>They lost their house, their money, and finally, their lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>"We owe it to them," they said. "They've been so good to us!" That's what my parents always used to say. They trusted in things that couldn't be seen, and wound up with nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>While my life was threatened as well, I managed to escape. No one pursued me. I suppose they just didn't think I mattered much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>The point is, nobody truly cares about stolen purses. The perpetrators always get away with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>And it makes sense nobody cares. Everyone had their own matters to attend to. They can't be bothered fretting over someone else's misfortune. It's the only way to survive here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>That's why I wanted to prove that military rule could be accomplished entirely through known quantitiesâ€”as opposed to variables.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>That's why I needed to study, plan, and experiment as much as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>To do so, I needed time... Time to take care of any unknowns, preparing for every eventuality and building the strength we'd need to make sure no pesky variables would ever slow us down...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Even if it meant becoming a demon myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>There was one who tried establishing military rule by killing a god.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>That quickly fell apart, unsurprisingly. I could have told them, trying to take care of an unknown variable as big as a god is never a good idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Only that which can be proven is reliable enough to work with. My research alone will save Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>That's why no variables can be allowed to exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>I'll use whatever I deem necessary to eliminate them: Demons, humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Even The Sun King himself, whom Greed Dike adores so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>If it will help me attain military rule for this fine country, no price is too high.</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<tr>

<td>On that, we are in agreement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>You should be more introspective, perhaps. Focusing too much on your goal is bound to give you tunnel vision. You're liable to slip on a leaf.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
