<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This is the true strength of Amaterasu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...She's strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Heheh. After finishing all of you off, I'll use this girl to manipulate the sun and moon...plunging all worlds into darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>For starters, I already have four of the Sun Keys that I need to do that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Do you understand? This key is practically the same thing as your sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I know! That's why we won't let you hide the sun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh...key...? Y-you can't touch that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Tsk! Seems like her responsibility as the caretaker has made her regain her sanity a little? ...Still, it's too late!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm going to deal despair first and foremost to you people who have gotten in my way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm going to do this by destroying the sun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Kayako screams this and rapidly slams down and destroys the four Sun Keys in her hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Aaaaahhhh!!! How could you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We can't afford for evenÂ one Sun Key to be destroyed! And you destroyed all four of them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I can't even be a substitute in this case...all the worlds will fall into darkness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I-it's all my fault...if only I protected the Twilight Zone properly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Amaterasu, it's okay. We won't let the Sun Keys for our worlds be destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh? Didn't you just see? I destroyed the keys with my own hands just now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I saw, but...the keys to our worlds are still here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The four pull out their keys and show them to the shocked Kayako.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Impossible! There should only be one Sun Key to every world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We don't plan to give away the secret. After all, we know you're a troublesome opponent to deal with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I...we are pirates that traveled multiple worlds, making the impossible possible! Accomplishing something like this is nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Arghhh...?! No, I still won't admit defeat! I will make Amaterasu descend further into darkness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Amaterasu! Look! The Sun Keys are safe! Open your eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If protecting the sun is your job...then protect them properly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You learned the importance of that from that pirate, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's right...he told me...without the sun, there would be nothing to enjoy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...Grroohhhhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Impossible! Did Amaterasu just repel Uzushiomaru from her body?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Now, everyone! Let's defeat Kayako and settle this once and for all! If we can do that then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yes! We can stop Amaterasu from having to make the same sacrifice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Sacrifice...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>In the timeline that we came from, the keys were destroyed and, because the sun vanished, you sacrificed yourself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But you don't have to follow in those same footsteps anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Amaterasu, please, fight with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Amaterasu! As friends, let's protect the sun together and fight side by side...please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If these are the friends that the captain said I would encounter...then I choose to believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You little...brats! I won't allow you to destroy my scheme!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Very well. I'll use this Sun Key's power to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We won't let you! We have the same key here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I can't control its power! Then I will beat you all by force and gain complete control over you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Uzushiomaru, wield all your power and take them all down!</td>
</tr>
