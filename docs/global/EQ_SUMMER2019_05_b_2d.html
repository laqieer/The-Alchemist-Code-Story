<td>Ready... Fire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Phew! We did it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The beach should be safe now. All that's left is to return these swimming trunks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Bertha...you take them. I'd really rather not touch those.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What?! I don't wanna touch 'em, either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh? Kaya? What're you staring at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>There was no trace of a human hand having meddled with the Demon's seal. What I did find was some viscous residue and a faint whiff of the sea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Could that octopus have broken the seal? No... Perhaps I have underestimated just how deeply these ruins are connected to the Octopoda...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's no good. She's in a world of her own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This whole mission has been riddled with octopuses from beginning to end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I wonder if the treasure hidden in the ruins was meant to be the Demon? I was hoping for an epic adventure, but all I got was one giant octopus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So long as you are safe and sound, Xiao-Xiao. I need nothing more than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Besides... An octopus that size is a fine catch indeed. You may look forward to a sumptuous feast once we are back on board the ship!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No, no, no, no, no! You are banned from entering the galley, mister! Not happening. Not a chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Seriously?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Su Yi worked really hard to find me... That'll be my treasure. Nothing could possibly beat that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Su Yi...? Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Um... According to this map, the treasure should be...around here...somewhere...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Whoa! Su Yi spoke her mind! Just like that! I'm so proud!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh! Hey, Su Yi! There's something here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Is this...an octopus pot? It's huge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I suppose an octopus as large as the one we fought would need a pot this size.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Let's turn it over and see if there's anything inside!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Umf...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Whoa! What's all this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Are these...pearls? There are so many of them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And quite large ones, at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I have heard that octopuses have a penchant for white things. It was likely collecting them and hiding them in its pot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Wow, Su Yi! You make an amazing treasure hunter! Right, Liu Shen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Indeed. A treasure-hunting prodigy, one might say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>N-no! It's nothing like that! I just happened t-to stumble across it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Pfft! I didn't see any stumbling! You worked hard to research and locate this place, and that means this treasure was discovered by none other than you, Su Yi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If you weren't here, I bet we never would have found this booty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I worked...hard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I guess I did... Heheh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But I didn't do it alone! This was a team effort. Bertha and Sharon helped, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I couldn't have done it without them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Su Yi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Then I guess that makes these pearls the Xiao Shenmei's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Nah, that's not quite right. They're a symbol of the bonds that bind all of us standing here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>May the summer heat open your mind and heart. Wishing you a lovely summer!</td>
