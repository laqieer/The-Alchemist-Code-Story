<td>Tch! Who would have thought I'd be halted like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It is because you never accepted my modifications when you were alive that you have been defeated now as a Phantom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Heheh. Looks like you're pretty adept at modding things. Still not gonna let you lay a hand on my bike, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Besides, we were lighter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Lighter, eh? I guess my motorcycle's pretty heavy, but still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Isn't her mech gear heavy, too? It doesn't look that much lighter than my bike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I think he's talking about our weight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hey! What do you mean by that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You trying to say I'm heavy?! I can shed a few bullets worth of weight, if that's what you mean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Calm down! Stop shooting at me! Nobody's saying you're fat! You just have some bigger...parts than she does!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What...? Did you just...? That's sexual harassment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Your cannon was what was really weighing us down, you great big lug!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What?! You have something to say about my baby girl?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Are you forgetting that you were only able to go so fast because me and my girl were blowing all the obstacles out of the way for you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I could have finished the race in five seconds had I not been weighed down by your cannon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Daisy, might we not cross the finish line already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, yeah! Sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Team Mech Gear pushes past the quarreling Blonde Sloths and finishes first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We did it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Not bad, little savage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We're done here, right? May I take my leave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I must retrieve that loincloth, lest it get blown away by the wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You're...really going back for it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Congratulations, Daisy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Thanks, Teona!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This proves that I can be number one, right?! Leema will take me back, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So... You think you're number one, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Teona?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Heheheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Daisy... You're not number one yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You've grown considerably since fighting those monsters yesterday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You can now expertly handle your mech gear in battle, even with all the upgrades Reagan applied to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>However, you mustn't forget that in this arena stands the Arena Champion herself! That's right... You cannot be number one without first defeating me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Now, Daisy! Show me your real strength!</td>
