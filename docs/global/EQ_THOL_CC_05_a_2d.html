<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Do not look upon me so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You, who heed me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Horns...a tail, and scales...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Would you look at that. Another dragon here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Dragon...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Is this the end of Veda? Is this the Truth meant to be reached?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Truth? What is this Truth you speak of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Is...this not your tower?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It is where I...am. Where I sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There is much I do not know. What is there above? What awaits out there? Why was I born?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So you don't know...anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Do not ask anymore. It has been long since another came to heed my voice, and so I am delighted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Still, do not ask anything of me. I do not have any satisfactory answers for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So you want me to heed you...but not ask you anything I want to hear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ask no more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're a spoiled one, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>And also... Could you sheathe that blade of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You dare defy me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I am in the middle of fighting my way through this tower to obtain power. I will cut down—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm scared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's sharp. It looks...scary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Uhhhh... Y-yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Right... Yeah, you don't know anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So, you too crave power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That...was the plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If you so desire, I can give it to you. That is the only thing I know. The only role I can carry out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(The legend states that one will gain power in exchange for some sort of compensation at the top of the Mystic Tower Veda.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(I could not find a single person in Lost Blue who had achieved such power. I was beginning to think it was all a superstition.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But...you will most likely break. Much like the others. If you are full of greed, imprudent, unable to reflect upon one's self...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You're wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm not the one this power is for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Who else is there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I want power for Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I want it to herald the world's end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I won't take it for free. What do you want in exchange?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, oops. Am I not allowed to ask that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Someone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I want...someone. Anyone...to be by my side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>J-just one person would do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Though...I know it cannot be granted. Humans have a home to go back to. Back to the world below this tower, far from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'll grant it for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wh-what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Can you let me do one thing, first?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I... I don't think you understand. To be with me means for all of eternity, you will—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I just need to leave a path behind for a particular someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Y-you're just going to leave and never come back, aren't you? You can't go! There is no way that you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Being so restrictive isn't an attractive trait, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>A-attra—?! Wh-what...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You're feeling lonely, right? Don't worry. I'll be back soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I could use some help to make sure I can, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Even if you ask me, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'll be needing a mount to rush back up here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I mean, I'm going to be dedicating my life to this. I think I deserve a little extra for my pains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If you could give me an advance payment, that'd be great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I like it. It's right up my alley.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I've been called a lot of different things, but nothing seemed to suit me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Nihil... Nothing... A word that equates to the number zero. I like it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Perfect. That'll be my name from now on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I want you to give power to will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>An evil power that can defeat that of righteousness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>A destructive power that can shatter the peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Power is everything, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>So why not take it for ourselves and flip this world on its end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>That's one crazy, futile ambition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Not big enough for you? What about world domination?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>We, who have never been given the space to really live, taking on the world with power from another dimension...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Pretty cool, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Do you not believe it is pointless to get this power now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You accepted me, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You are...different, Vanir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>When I was in the lower levels of Veda, I saw countless vile humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I saw wretched greed, self-righteous malice, egregious claims, compassionless violence...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>And yet I was elated to be sought after.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Back when I was entirely too clueless, I gave those humans power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>But that power changed them. It changed them into something inhuman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Inhuman...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>All I am able to do is provide the chance to gain power. And to do that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Whatever makes that human who they are, and whatever it is that human has that keeps them going... Those things must be given up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>By doing so, they are able to explosively boost their power, but the power changes them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Every single one of those who sought power while still immature and weak-willed... They lost sight of who they were, destroying themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>There were those who howled vile words at me, some who tactlessly fell to the Phantom soldiers of the tower, and some who ended themselves after losing their purpose in life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Those inhuman fools who lost their human soul cast the blame upon me. "Why did you give us power?" they asked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I did not understand their reaction, and that brought over me a sense of discomfort. Is it not predestined for humans to perish? Is it not always humans who long for destruction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>And so I destroyed them with my own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>It was never my intention for things to come to that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What about that lengthy process you were so proud of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>This is necessary for selection. Of her powers, her personage...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I believe you're doing something similar, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>What drives humans to desire power so? Why would they sacrifice what makes them who they are for the sake of destruction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>All just because they had something they considered worth protecting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>So I gave power to those who desired it. When they inevitably broke, the cycle would repeat. Over and over again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I could not bear getting to know another. So I escaped to the higher levels of Veda, still clinging on to a grain of hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I thought if there was one who was able to reach where I stood... If they had the strength of will to make it here... Then perhaps...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Those walls you've put up around your heart must be the many floors of Mystic Tower Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Could that be so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>The summit of Veda has still not manifested itself yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>The floors of Veda that remain unmanifested are proof that you believe in humankind's unworthiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You created the structure within this tower to reflect your desires: none without the Alchemia to pour into the tower, to prove their strength, are allowed to proceed through the tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>My heart's desires... Reflected in this tower...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>It seems likely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Vanir... You call me a dragon. Yet we can come to understand each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>What am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Why am I here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Don't fret over it. I'm the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I need someone beside me in order to know who I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>And that someone will be here soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>You're late, prodigy child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Vanir...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>What did you go by now again? Nihil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>What are you doing in Veda?! I... I heard you disappeared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Such rumors do me discredit. It's only that my mount is a bit slow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>What is going on? I thought you would have moved on far ahead. What are you doing at such a low floor level?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Let me ask you this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Do you have something you consider important to you? Do you have something or someone that ensures you never lose sight of yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>So you won't answer my question?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Tell me. Is there something you base your sense of self on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I'm still looking for that. Hence, my name now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Would you be willing to give that up for the sake of strength?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about, but if I were to give you an answer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Will you be able to hold on to your humanity, even if you lose sight of that one thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>How can you be so sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Why are you asking me this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>You made me this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>I used to value my own life above all else, until you taught me otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>I used to have nothing until you taught me how to dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I inherited your crazy wish to bring a blue sky here to Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Humanity's will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Thanks to you disappearing, I'm happily enjoying a spin of nihilism.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>But I will find—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Good answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>I'm now the vanguard of Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Show me the strength of your will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>A vanguard for...?! Are you saying you're no longer human?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Show me that you're not just all talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Dammit, you're being very uncool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Am I? Here we are, at an impasse... I aim to make my way ahead, and you aim to surpass me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>You said I was special to you! N-not that I believed you or anything...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Well, let me treat you specially now. Face me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>So you're trying to hammer down the nail that's sticking out? You'll do anything to make it further ahead, regardless of what happens to those behind you, won't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>What of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>You are being absolutely uncool right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Did you notice the dragon watching us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Vanir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>I'll teach you one last bit of the basics.</td>
</tr>
