<td>Whew. We managed to drive the monsters back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Grrrooooooggghhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Nngh... The wind is getting stronger! Now not only can I not see, but I can barely move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast must be causing this storm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Nimul, what should we do? If this continues...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We have no choice. We must use the Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What?! We need that to seal the Cursed Beast of Gluttony!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That is exactly why we must use it now! We must test it, and it had better be before this ship gets any closer to the Cursed Beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This ship is absolutely indispensable in traveling between the Belt Regions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We must do something before it takes anymore damage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Orb of Si Xiang the Protector! Hear our cry! Lend your strength to this blade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Did the blade's light reach the Cursed Beast?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A torrent of magil...this must mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Groooogghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Th-this... Ngh... Matter of the swirling winds above! Save us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Nimul! Waginau! Yna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh! Their magil response has been confirmed! They're still alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I can't understand it, though. Despite that huge wave of magil, it doesn't seem like the Cursed Beast has been affected at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I have to go out there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Emmel?! Where are you going?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>They must have been hurt! I have to use my Spiritbonding to heal them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And...I am the Vessel of Purification. There is a possibility that I can do something to stop the Cursed Beast as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Calm down! If you go out like this, you'll just be another target for the Cursed Beast to destroy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>When you stopped that dragon, you could barely even stand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If you fall here, who is going to save the Gula Belt Region of Gluttony?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I... But what can we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'll force the engine to fire up again and get the ship moving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If we do that, maybe we can distract the Cursed Beast long enough to give Nimul and the others a chance to strike back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What? But earlier you said—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Like I said, I'm going to force it! But it'll strain the power reactor, and the repairs that'll be needed to fix it will be way more comprehensive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Still, it's better than just sitting here and watching them die, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>All right. So first we'll need to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Grrrooooooggghhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yikes! Here it comes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Is it...looking at us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Emmel! Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Nngh... Yna, Waginau...are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes...somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It shattered my sword...with only its roar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>How can this be? With the magil intensity of something like Matter, my plan ought to have worked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We should have been able to break through the Cursed Beast's barrier of corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Was I mistaken? Then all of the sacrifices we've made, everything that I have done up till now...was it all...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast...is looking at the ship?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Wait! No! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Grrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Uhh...? Is it not going to attack?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>My, my! Adaleigh, how could you? You've changed since the last time I saw you! Pushing a woman down like that—I didn't know you had it in you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Give him a break, Mira. Adaleigh is a man, after all. Er, not that I would know anything about that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Wh-what? I know those voices!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Adaleigh, are they...friends of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hey there, Adaleigh! It's been a while! Who's this lovely lady? Nice to meet you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'm Mira, a Space-Time Manipulation apprentice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>And I'm her younger brother, Nyx.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Oh, I'm⁠—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Grrrooooooggghhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Whoops! Did we come at a bad time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Get ready, Nyx! Spin that magil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah... Space-Time Manipulation: Anti-Curse Reignition! Preparing to reconnect to space!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Time is finite!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yet also infinite! Libra has granted us control! Spin your magil round and round!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast's attack...was stopped?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Intensity lowered! Hm. Guess that's about all that can be expected from a prototype.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>True. Worked well enough to give us a chance to get away, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Yep! Unless you've got a better idea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I've got nothing! Shall we get out of here? C'mon, you two! You'll want to hold on to me pretty tightly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You're planning to jump?! But...we've got friends outside, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Don't worry! Our teacher's got them well in hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Nngh... Mira...I can't hold this for much longer! Hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Aw, Nyx. I thought you were made of sterner stuff than this! All right, time to get this going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Coordinates confirmed, jump initiated! Uh-oh. Too far? Hm. This might be a little tough for me on my own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Mira... Come on...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Just a moment! I'm going to borrow a little more magil from Libra!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>All right, activation complete! Let's get outta here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>What is this? The reality before me is...becoming twisted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Time to go home! Ready or not, here we come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It stopped the Cursed Beast's attack? What was that?! Is Emmel okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Not very smart, hm? Come, my apprentices have already jumped to safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Tsk... This is what I get for being curious, I suppose. I sensed the magil of someone I remembered, and ended up in the middle of a battle! Ridiculous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Is that...a child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Ha! Foolish boy. You're showing your immaturity by judging someone before you've even gotten to know the first thing about them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Foolish boy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Er...excuse me. Miss? Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Well, you're a little more clever than the rest, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Let's save the introductions for later. Other ice beasts will be headed this way, drawn by the corruption of the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Better to run and fight another day, don't you think? What, you don't trust me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Well, not that I don't understand where you're coming from, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>The way I see it, your options are to either come with me and live, or become the prey of these creatures and likely not. Which will it be, gentlemen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I have no intention of dying here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Of course not. Are we agreed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>We are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Naturally!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Good, good. You mustn't give up just because things grew a little difficult. That would be beyond foolish. Now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I suppose I don't mind helping you out a little.</td>
