<td>Oh, I see you've brought some guests. What a lively bunch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Party...find power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Sweet of you to inform me. Regrettably, that is usually the only reason mortals seek me out...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>THAT'S her big sis?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Definitely not biological. That there's an elf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We ought to be careful boss, they're known for their extreme magical power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>An elf? Boys, we hit the jackpot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Let me talk to her boss, we should give off a more humbled appearance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Greetings, adventurers. What brings your party to this part of the forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>O great elf, we've travelled far and wide in search of power. And as luck would have it, today is the day we meet one in person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>As adventurers, we aim to use this power for a noble cause. I believe a great elf such as yourself would grant us the ability to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>A compelling story. You seem to know a little about the nature of elves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You may call me Morrigan. Consider me interested in your quest for improvement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We thank you deeply o great elf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>*That was pretty good! I think she's convinced!*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>However, an obligatory warning to your party.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Enough with the riddles, you know what we want, so let's kick things up a notch.</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ohhh yeah... that's the stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This is incredible! I can feel the power coursing through my veins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Eira, don't you wanna get stronger too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>How odd. You think the little one is as delicate as she looks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If your party is a waterfall that can erode the rocks, then Eira is a wave that can turn the tides of the ocean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>More like cause the tides to come to a screeching halt! Let's go. I remember passing by a hydra cave on the way here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No! ... Danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Eh? Isn't that a bit too much? I know we're much stronger now but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yeah boss, seems like a huge leap from wolves and the like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You two have to be joking. What else are we going to use this power for? This is the time to become heroes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hey foxgirl! You're coming with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hydra... bad idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>An alph- Is she seriously...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Look, I know I've been rough on you, but its time you experience what it means to be a true adventurer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Mor-Morrigan... help...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Best you join them, Eira. They're not the type to listen to external advice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...difficult...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It certainly puts you in an unfavorable position, but I believe you have the capability to rise up to the occasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Try to prevent their demise, Eira. They need you more than they know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ueehh...</td>
