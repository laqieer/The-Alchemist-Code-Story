<td>001</td>
<td>Oh, wow! She's gone, just like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's all for today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Whoa! Pamela, you're awesome! That was great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Eheheh. I guess I got really into it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Group work is so much fun! This is my first time working with others, so I'm really excited!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Really? Well then, let's keep working hard again together next time, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>How about you try working at all next time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You three did wonderfully today. I was wondering what was going on when you came in together, right at the chime, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I can't complain about these results. You three make a great combination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah! You're right! Eheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heh. Well, it's lunch break, so why don't we all eat lunch outside together? The weather is really nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yay! That sounds fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh, I forgot my lunch. I'm gonna go buy something, so go on ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Okay. Let's go, Pamela.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hey, Ms. Celine...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No problem!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It was a good opportunity to get to know Noah better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You're exaggerating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Pamela! There you are! You didn't arrive at the specified time so I came looking for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh yeah! I forgot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But I'm going to have lunch with these two now, so I'll come and join you later, once—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Lunch?! Who do you think you are?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh... I... Uh... Is it something to get so mad over? If people don't eat they die, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Obviously!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's not the issue here! If you need lunch, we'll arrange that, so come. Get a move on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The preparations are already made and we can't miss this chance! Well? Hurry up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>H-hey! What is wrong with you? This is not acceptable! Pamela doesn't want to go with you, or is that not obvious enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Noah's right! Let Pamela go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Shut up. This has nothing to do with you average school girls!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We are under the orders of the Helkovara family. If we say so, you'll be expelled. Is that what you want, Noah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I said I'll come later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What difference does it make to you if you come now or later? There's no reason for you to be so attached to this school where you have no friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Th-that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You were abandoned by your family. The only purpose of your existence is to devote the use of your magic to our cause. That is the only reason you've been allowed to live this long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Pamela...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(We're the same, she and I.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I'm sorry. Don't be mad. I'll be good, so don't be mad. I'll be good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Please don't say you don't need me anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I should never have had you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(Pamela is in the same position as I was back then... She's given up looking for someone to save her.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(I can't just leave her be.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Who let you come to school at all? Who let you live to such an age? It's high time you repay that debt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Excuse you... You're really damn annoying, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Excuse... Excuse me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>No one gets to decide Pamela's reason to live except for her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What are you getting all upset about? This has nothing to do with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Of course it does. You're talking about dooming my friend to some weird fate of your choosing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Emma...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Emma is correct. Your uncompromising attitude is unacceptable, and I—for one—am thoroughly opposed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Heed me, Noah... These delinquent children will wind up getting even you, an honor student, expelled! What a waste that would be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Emma and Pamela are my friends. Don't you dare insult my friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'm your...friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What nonsense! This brat couldn't possibly make any friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Wrong. She's already made some. We three get along awfully well, don't we girls?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Awfully well. What's more, we friends are about to have lunch, so why don't you take your high hat and toddle off to bother someone else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You cocky brats!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Enough! We don't have time for this! Come along, Pamela!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I get it now. So that's how it works... That's how you make friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>All my efforts were just clouding the heart of the matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What are you on about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What it comes down to is that I have friends here, and if I have friends here, then I have ties to this school!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I haven't even had the chance to eat lunch with my friends, yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You expect your debts to just vanish into thin air?!</td>
</tr>
