<td>Tsk! What're you wasting time on?! My right arm isn't gonna hold forever!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Easy for you to say! You...!</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Tsk. Here. That light that wraps around its body is what's blocking the bullets!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What pathetic bullets! Die!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...!</td>

<td>You piece of...even the bazooka is ineffective against it!</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hehe. Well then, shall we finish this?!</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Not good! It's planning on shooting its light blade as well! Prevent it, massive-armed idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't give me orders!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hehe. It's useless.</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hey, hurry up! I've only got a few bullets left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Fine. Leave it to me. I'll finish it off with one shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Have you not realized?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Every time the bazooka is fired at you, a ripple spreads throughout the curtain of light that engulfs you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>In other words, a momentary difference in thickness occurs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Impossible...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Now, what would happened if I shot the ultimate amount of Alchemic energy into the thinnest portion of that curtain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I've seen through the rhythm of the ripple effect! Take that!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Agh...! Giga...gugagaga!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Tsk. I'm out of bullets. You waited until the last minute, idiot.</td>

<td>Messiah...?</td>

<td>Alva...rez... I'm not sure if he's himself...right now...guga...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What do you mean? Hey!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's useless. It already stopped functioning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Tsk! There's no point if we can't grasp his location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You mean where Alvarez went?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If he's taken the Timekeeper then there's only one place he could've headed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The clock tower?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>All the secrets are hidden there. I'm sure Alvarez is headed that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>And, most likely...that redhead is as well.</td>
