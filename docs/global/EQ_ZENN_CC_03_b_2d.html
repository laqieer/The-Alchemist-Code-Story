<td>And I certainly would have had no need for you!</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What?</td>

<tr>

<td>D. Lily! Have you gone mad?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Let's get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>He's right, you know. You will regret this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's a little too late for that now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Are you sure it's wise to take me with you? There's no telling what a beast like that will do without its dinner. I was supposed to be the sacrifice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You are not a sacrifice, Mitsu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No one's going to eat you. I won't let them. That's cannibalism.</td>

<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Mm-mmm! I've outdone myself this time. I really am one talented individual!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>This should make up for our little fight the other day. After all, I'm sure the boss was just looking out for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Besides, I'm glad I can give him something to look forward to at the end of a long, hard day. This is what family is all about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ahh, I can't wait! Tonight's dinner is going to be a good one, I can feel it!</td>
