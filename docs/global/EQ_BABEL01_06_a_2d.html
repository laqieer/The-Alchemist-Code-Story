<td>Ughh...I think I'm at the end of my rope. My eyesight is beginning to grow hazy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Is my chivalrous knighthood going to end here?! You gotta be kidding me!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Tsk. My name is Victor! I belong to Envylia's Scarlet Flame Guard... I'm a knight of justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>When someone is fueled with a strong and passionate emotion, that's the first time they can stand on their own two feet as a person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Victor...?! What are you doing? Why are you here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I was worried about you, Commander Chloe, so I asked Captain Vettel to allow me to come here and help you! This is my memorable first mission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Enough! Sorry, Kanon... We'll be fine here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Injured?! Are you okay, Commander Chloe?! Why...? Why did you befriend Spica when she's the enemy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>She's not the enemy anymore. Thanks to her help, we were able to prevent this volcano from erupting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Tsk! You're pretty reckless for a new kid, huh? I can't believe you came all the way back on your own...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Um... I'm fine here, so...if you need to, go ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What?! No way! Look at you! You're practically falling apart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This is nothing. More importantly, he seems to be more likely to die and I think you don't want that to happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...Thank you, Spica. The rest of you, please escort this woman in my stead! I'll take care of Victor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Understood, Commander Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Spica, we will meet again one day. That's a promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I knew I was right! You're here to assassinate Lord Commander Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>When you're with someone long enough, you learn to accept each other. That's what normal people do. Idiot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm telling you, that passionate feeling you have now is what lies in the center of being human! Come on, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Are you alright? We're close the border. We'll be there soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You should worry more about your own injuries, Commander Chloe! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This isn't the time for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I could say the same to you. Something big is happening in the world... Even I can see that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes... We must inform Captain Vettel at once! Whatâ€”?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This is terrible timing. Victor...can you do this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Honestly, I'm kinda in a lot of pain...but I'm not about to die here! Nngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Urgaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No! I won't make it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Gotcha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Are the two of you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Whew... Yes, thank you, but what were you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This is part of my daily training routine. After a thousand swings of my sword, I patrol the area around my village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>A thousand swings? That sounds familiar... Did someone teach that to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes! But I don't have anyone to practice against, so I've been battling goblins instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>How did you know? I learned this from someone in the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Uh... We're knights of the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What? Really? Oh! Um... Please, help me join the Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I was saved by those of the Scarlet Flame Guard, not once, but twice, and yet...I haven't been able to pay them back properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Back then, I was weak and unable to help in any way. After being saved by the Scarlet Flame Guard, I was inspired to do something to change that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I have finally succeeded! There's someone in the Scarlet Flame Guard that I want to show!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I have trained every day, ever since! Not resting even once... So, please, take me with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You... Your passion is incredible! I definitely sense your strong will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's not just strong, it's made of iron!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Aha! You've definitely come in contact with Vice-Captain Gerald! Come on, Chloe, let's take her with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wait a second, Victor. Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>My name is Nina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Right, Nina... Um, so...Nina, I fully recognize and appreciate your passion, but unfortunately we really can't help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Commander Chloe?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>But...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The battlefield is an unforgiving place. You can't imagine what it's really like. If you fail, your friends and comrades could be injured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>They could even die. You're still young. I'm sure you have no desire to die a fruitless death on some nameless battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Th-that's not...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Nina, listen. I once had someone I greatly respected, and that person... They died. Because of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I blamed myself for it. I suffered, unable to forgive myself. Now, I am able to use my sword to help people because I've come to believe that is what he would want me to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I do it to carry his legacy. That's why I do what I do. It's my reason for living. That I am able to live this life is a result of me coming to terms with that reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I don't want to put that burden on you. I don't want you to ever have to carry that burden. That's why I cannot take you with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Commander Chloe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What?! More goblins?! So...many...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Urk! There's nothing for it, I guess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Don't worry. Let me take care of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>By yourself?! That's impossible! Fall back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I have trained all this time to join the Scarlet Flame Guard, because I wanted to become someone who could protect others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I didn't choose this path lightly! This is my purpose in life! This is what I want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I will show you how strong my conviction is!</td>
