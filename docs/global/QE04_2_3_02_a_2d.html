<td>Whoa! You're flying, lady! What's with that wand? I wanna see it! Can I touch it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huh...? No, look...Rega...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hey, could I fly with this as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's moving with magic so it might be a little difficult. Are you interested in these kinds of things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah! Apparently, my grandpa was a merchant who dealt with weapons...so I like weapons too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hey, can I look at it more closely?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>U-um... Right now might not be the best time. How about next time, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yay! That's a promise, lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Seriously. He's just a kid. Why did Tehre choose a kid as his envoy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Knowing that boy, I'm sure there's some reason behind it. He's a clever little brat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Rega...we are all from the same land of Saga. We can work things out without fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I think so too, but...Tehre...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Grrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Kiki...Adel...haha, stop...it feels ticklish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Both Kiki and Adel feel the same way. You understand that, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yeah! But...I wonder what I should do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What exactly is Tehre trying to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm not sure. But he says that, if he can't get the Sacred Stone, he'll take out both Voda and Fuu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>He said that it's for the good of Saga, so I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We won't let him do that. Just leave it to us. Right, Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah. We're going to protect Saga. Will you help us too, Rega?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Tell Tehre that we'll go to him. Tell him that we can talk things over without resorting to such measures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I guess I can tell him that, but, I'm part of Tehre's people, so I can't betray him that easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That being said, how are we going to get out of this situation? Before we consider talking things over...let's try to survive our current predicament.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What is that kid doing? Where's the signal?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's why I didn't want to leave it in the hands of a blasted child!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Forget the signal! Sooner or later, we'll be invading anyway! Attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What...they didn't wait for the signal?! Is that even allowed...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No! We must protect the settlements!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ack! Everyone, brace yourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That being said, as long as they keep up this pincer attack, we're spread fairly thin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ack! But we've gotta try! Keep damage to the minimum!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>For Kiki and Adel's sake as well...I can't let Gluttony invade us like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Rega...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You guys should focus on the troops coming from the Forest of Rukifojio! I'll ambush the army coming from Port Nahema!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What?! What're you gonna do on your own? Don't let your life go to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Don't worry! I'm good at these kinds of things! Let's go, Kiki, Adel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Rega!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Let's believe in him, Tina! Right now, we need to focus on the enemy in front of us!</td>
