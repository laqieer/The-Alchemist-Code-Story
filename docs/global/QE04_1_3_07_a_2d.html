<td>Gluttony was creating the Jam...?! What do you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Whether they have them feeding off the trees in the forest or if they're cultivating them themselves...I'm not sure about the details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But...there's a high possibility that the Gluttony Foss soldiers are growing the Jam somehow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Gluttony...?! Do you mean that they're being created artificially?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hmph. Your skills of observation are problematic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So you were the ones who were destroying the forests and creating the Jam!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Now that you've figured this out, you leave me with little choice. Oh well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We'll transform you into the cornerstone of our army! Hahahah!</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wait! Wh-what the...?! What is this terrifying presence?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Liz, there's something I want you to do for me! Please take this child back to the Paza village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Since we uncovered their scheme...they're now creating a massive Jam outbreak! Hurry. We need to evacuate everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This isn't good! I can sense the presence of something powerful and corrupt coming from all corners!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ack! We don't have time, Liz! We can't let the kid return to the village alone...do you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Agh...but if it's just the two of you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Don't worry, Liz. Trust your friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We have the wind and the trees on our side. We won't go down that easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Please, don't worry about us. Go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But...if either of you gets hurt...I'm going to get really mad at you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Got it. I promise we'll be okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tsk! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>O-okay...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Mocca, have you noticed...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes. The corrupt presence is expanding...most likely, the Jam are fusing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ack! At this rate, it'll become gigantic!</td>
