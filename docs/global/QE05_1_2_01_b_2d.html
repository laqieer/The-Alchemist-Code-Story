<td>Hellooo, anybody home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Miss Malta? Is that you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Kamui's out right now, but go ahead and let yourself in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hello, little man of the house! Do you know where Kamui has gone off to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Isidore showed up and dragged him off to visit Sephiron or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh, I see, so I just missed him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So...you're here to hang out with Kamui again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I-I didn't say that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I mean, I wanted to check on you, Hisham! How have you been sleeping? Any more nightmares?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Mm... Sometimes, but I just forget them as soon as I wake up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ah... So no new clues or memories about where you're from, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Aw, don't look so sad. I'm sure you'll remember soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>More importantly, look at you! It seems like you've bounced back! Why don't we go for a walk since you're feeling better?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Besides, aren't you curious about the rest of the village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wait, really?! Kamui told me I wasn't allowed to wander around outside on my own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hehe, I'm kind of an important person around here. No one will question it if you're with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If I say it's fine, they'll have no choice but to accept it! Um, except for my father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Isn't that...kind of a big deal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>W-well, at the very least, I should be able to show you around. What do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Of course! I want to see the ruins at the foot of Sephiron!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The altar? Hm... I don't think I can do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Aw, okay! B-but I still wanna go out for a walk! Please, Miss Malta!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Of course! Come with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Whoa... Sephiron is as amazingly big as ever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Incredible, isn't it? The great tree of life, Sephiron, the pillar of our world, which watches over us all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I can't see it from Kamui's place, though. I wonder why we don't have a window that faces it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The light of Sephiron shines even deep into the night. You wouldn't want that to disturb your sleep, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, I had no idea. Kamui told me it was too dangerous to go out at night, so I've never seen it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That's true, actually! Night is when the beasts come out, so you should avoid going out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But...isn't this village protected by a mirage barrier? How can beasts come in here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Who told you that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Isidore told me when he was drinking with Kamui once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That man... Honestly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Wait, am I not supposed to know about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Not necessarily, but he really shouldn't be running his mouth when drinking, for security reasons. I suppose it's fine if it's you, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The barrier around this village is aimed only at people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Especially those who have machinations regarding Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The sephirah that appear on the bodies of those who live in this village are proof that Sephiron herself has given us permission to live at her foot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh... That's what that mark on Kamui's arm means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The beasts that come are only doing their best to survive. There is no reason to bar them from the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Outside of this place, there is only desert and wilderness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The blessings of the great tree Sephiron are for all who live on this continent. Sephiron does not deny those beings who wish only to live their lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>As such, we do not do so, either. The night is for the beasts, and the day is ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We do not try to chase them out or engage them in unnecessary battle. Even now, our way of life is plentiful enough as it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>At most, we will defend our fields and our livestock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, so Kamui was called to do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Well, many ask for his help, as Kamui is the most powerful Spiritbonder in the village, but if it was Isidore? I expect so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>So Kamui's really popular, huh? Miss Malta, you must get nervous about that, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Heh, I mean, aren't you showing me around because you're hoping to see him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>N-no, I was just, you know, checking in with my patient! Doing my due diligence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Aw, that's disappointing. You know, if you keep making excuses like this, you'll never be more than childhood friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Uh-oh. Are you upset?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hisham, you little...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yikes! Y-you know, it looks really bad for the Chief's daughter to inflict violence upon a helpless youth such as myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'm sure people will just think I am doling out the appropriate measure of discipline!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Th-this is abuse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hey, get back here!</td>
</tr>
