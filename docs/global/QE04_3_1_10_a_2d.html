<td>Using Alchemy...? Unexpected.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I will protect Saga! That is the purpose of this power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hmph... Yet, you are still lacking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...?!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Tina!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You, whose existence has long been awaited! Know that a straight arrow does not always fly true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Tehre...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...All you can see is Saga in its current state. You must cast your eyes beyond the past and present...and to the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And what is the future of Saga that you see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...When the time comes, you will see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Will you not tell us? We need to know, so we can work together. Please, Tehre.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You've grown old, Fuu. Look at you, bowing down to me. It seems this is another way the future takes form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Please, tell us what you are thinking, Tehre. If your priority is the future of Saga, I am certain we can work together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Just look at Voda and Fuu... Who would've thought they'd be able to work together?! I'm sure it's possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Saga has grown to rely too much on nature. In order to protect the land, it is essential that Asena is released.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We must first begin with that...with releasing Asena who even now suppresses the power of Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Asena...has Beelzebub?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh? So, you lacked this basic information even as you engaged in your diatribes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Fuu...is this true?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Indeed. I didn't want to reveal all. However, now that it has come to this, it cannot be helped. Asena currently possesses Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yet, you lacked this essential knowledge. I stand by my assessment that the future of Saga is too heavy a burden for any of you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Power is required to change the future. I suppose I can further teach you what I mean by this.</td>
