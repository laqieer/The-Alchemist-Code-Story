<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I knew it! It's Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You meddling Paladins of the Holy Guard are just here to take advantage of the strife in our country!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Holy Guard...? What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(Seeing my Spiritbonding somehow validated this idea for him, but how...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Call for reinforcements! The enemy uses Alchemy, but we can wear them down with numbers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Urk... This overwhelming number of soldiers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, well, well. It looks like you could use a hand, my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Who—?! No, that voice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That armor... There's no mistaking it for anything but that of the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So the army was looking for you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>W-we still have the advantage of numbers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmph. This numbers game is easy to settle with a little head-crushing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Sir Waginau, what should we do with the rest of the soldiers from Gluttony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There is no reason to waste unnecessary energy chasing after them. If they were searching for us, then they already knew we were here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Roger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Now then—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Lord Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Kamui, you have made a rather poor showing of it. However, it is good to see that you are uninjured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Now, it has been a while since I made my way back to the village. Would you mind leading the way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Chief, I have brought Lord Waginau to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Welcome. Thank you for coming such a long way. I am sorry to hear that you met some obstacles along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It was nothing. As knights of principle, we are used to being enveloped in the envy of lower men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I shall take my leave of the two of you, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No, Kamui. Stay. It is for this reason that I have asked this man to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ah, then this is the one you spoke of, Chief?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes. This is the one who will become the next Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I see. Well, I have no objections to this appointment. He is indeed one who is fit to bear the burden of Compassion this role requires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Please allow me to introduce myself properly now. I am Waginau of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I am Kamui, successor to Judah, the former Protector of this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Kamui, this man was once this village's Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This village's...? But in my memory, the last Protector was Judah. After he died, there was no successor, and so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yes. Waginau was the Protector several generations ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Generations?! I-I suppose I had heard in Saga that Protectors can gain an unusually long lifespan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Alchemy is a deep and varied art. While pushing the limits of its possibilities, at some point I realized I had become more spirit than human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This immortality is my curse for plunging into the most forbidden depths of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>However, the silver lining of this dark cloud is that I am now able to help guide new Protectors to their full potential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It is generally more ideal for the Protector's duties and knowledge to be passed down directly from predecessor to successor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ah, but since the line of succession was broken by Judah's death...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes. Luckily for us, we still have a former Protector who has plenty of experience and knowledge to share.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It is indeed fortunate, as we are entering an era where we will need the Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>As a result, Kamui... You will learn all of what it means to be the Protector from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I understand. I am in your debt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Waginau, I suspect you will be needing rest after your long journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Now that this has all been settled and introductions made, it would be best for the both of you to rest before the training starts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Thank you, Chief. Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Kamui! There you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I was so worried when I heard you'd been attacked by soldiers of Gluttony!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ah, it's nothing for you to worry about. I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have said anything about the caravan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>There's nothing to apologize for. It was my own choice to go. At least—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You must be the Chief's daughter. You carry yourself much like he does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Um... Who might you be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>This is Lord Waginau. He is a Paladin of the Holy Guard. I wouldn't have made it back if not for him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I see. Thank you so much, Lord Waginau. I am indeed the daughter of Chief Iakov. My name is Malta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>And you are also the druidic priestess of this village? I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Chief Iakov did say that the current druidic priestess was impressive, even compared to those who came before her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>With you at the helm, the resurrection ceremony should go off without a hitch. Sephiron will be pleased.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Lord Waginau, you know of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>These things once fell under the purview of one who was the Protector. I suspect I know most, if not all, of this village's secrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Then... Kamui...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Who is to say? Well, you do have your honor as a priestess. For your sake, I will keep this quiet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>However, do not forget this: Sephiron demands devotion and resolution before all else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Of course...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Then, if you will excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Malta. What were you and Waginau speaking of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Oh, um... It was nothing. Do not concern yourself with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Just... I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Something about him makes me worry. I am not sure why.</td>
</tr>
