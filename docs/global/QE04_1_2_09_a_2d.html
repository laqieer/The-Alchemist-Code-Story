<td>Is that why you avoided me as well, Tina? Like they did...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Don't put me in the same boat as them! I would never abandon someone who was under attack!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I know that, but...do you also feel you couldn't get along with people from other factions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well...</td>

<td>For example, I'm not from the Voda faction, right? You could say that I'm from the Lustburg faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But still...we've been able to work together this far, right?</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's because it's you and me. If you think about it from the perspective of one who governs...</td>

<td>How is it different?</td>

<td>What do you mean...?</td>

<td>I think what Liz said is the truth. Even if we come from different factions or beliefs, we can still get along.</td>

<td>Ultimately, we are all living in Saga. I'm sure we could all see eye-to-eye.</td>

<td>Are you talking about Fuu? It's true that my tribe belongs to the Fuu faction...I feel that responsibility heavily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But...that's another reason why I want to destroy the boundaries that separate our factions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Do you want to do that? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'll tell you all about it in time. It's the reason why I couldn't say anything in response to your words.</td>

<td>I'm sure you know how pointless all of this conflict is.</td>

<td>I'm certain that our biggest enemy is the prejudice that is deeply rooted in the hearts of all our people.</td>

<td>As long as that remains, even if we were to resurrect the wind Matter, I doubt we'd be able to restore peace.</td>
