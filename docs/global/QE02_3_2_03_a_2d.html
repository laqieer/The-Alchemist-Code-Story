<td>We haven't finished our conversation! What promise did you make with Mayor Edward?</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Seriously. You're annoying in your own right.</td>

<td>The mystery of the Sacred Stone?</td>

<td>He told me that the Sacred Stone Belphegor is the anchor to quelling this chaotic land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That it has the power to sway this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>He wanted to know if I could uncover the truth behind it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Mayor Edward asked you to do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yep. A sort of tit for tat. I ended up telling him that I would solve its mystery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's not that I have any personal interest in the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I just need it to fulfill my promise to the old man.</td>

<td>Huh? Jeez. And what about you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Your motivation isn't just based on your dislike for Alvarez, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes, about that...I'll need to clarify that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>In order to do so, I'll need to know what his idea of justice is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm gonna step aside for a bit. If you lose sight of the young lady, you'll have a lot to answer for, Tango!</td>

<td>He-hey...wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hey! Don just went off somewhere! Are you gonna let him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tsk. It's just like him to go off and do his own thing. Never mind him. Let's pursue the little lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>O-okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
