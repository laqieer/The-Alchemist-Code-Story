<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Tsk. What are those idiots doing? They're spread out so widely...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's been a year, hasn't it? Finally, I get to see you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's been a while. I've been looking all over for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Monzein! Seida!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...I'll ask you directly. What exactly is your intention for being here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I've come here to protect Kagura. I won't allow you lot to use her for your own means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I see. You don't seem to be under the threat of the Mikaboshi after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>How dangerous it would be to leave it unchecked...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Zain was trying to use that threat for himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>How can you not realize that you are being taken advantage of...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>How dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Lord Commander Zain's goal was to destroy the Mikaboshi! It was never to obtain it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Even if that were the case...how can you forgive him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Zain brought Kagura from Wadatsumi for the sole purpose of using her to achieve his own end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I will never forgive him for trying to take advantage of her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's nonsense! Lord Commander Zain would never think in that way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Please wait, Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Captain Kudan, so there is no way you could trust Lord Commander Zain now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Of course not. That's why I was willing to sacrifice my life and my honor to stop him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So...you can't trust us now either?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Lord Commander Zain is already dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>In other words...the object of your suspicion no longer exists within the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Can you not see eye-to-eye with us now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Eye-to-eye with you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes. At the very least, we have no intention of obtaining the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Our honest aim is simply to destroy it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ultimately, that's the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi is a Phantom Stone that harbors a similar power to that which resides in a Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>In other words, its existence is responsible for providing equilibrium to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If you were to destroy it, it would cause this balance to collapse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ultimately, it would result in exposing this world to danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The equilibrium of this world...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This world was created by Nimul and Emmel using the Alchemy Source. Its equilibrium is maintained using a precise balance of power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If you destroy the Mikaboshi, it would lead to the destruction of this equilibrium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It will be the same thing as leading this world to destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>So you mean that the destruction of the Mikaboshi will have an effect on the power in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Have you been brainwashed with garbage that the people from Greed Dike have been feeding you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's all nonsense! Can't you see why they're trying to use you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You know that I've made contact with them...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I don't know what kind of misunderstanding you've made, but they haven't talked me into anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>In fact, I'm the one that's using them for information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Shut up! In any case, there's no way we're letting you meet with Kagura in your current state!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Captain Monzein! Please wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You two haven't seen what's going on behind the surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Without even realizing it, you're going to repeat the tragedy that occurred to Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That's nonsense! Allowing the Mikaboshi to remain in this world is clearly a much greater threat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>As long as you are trapped by that way of thinking, I cannot allow Kagura to remain with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm taking her with me. If you still insist on standing in my way, regardless of everything I've told you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'll be left with no choice but to direct my spear against you...in order to protect this world from the threat of the Mikaboshi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Do you have no intention of returning to the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>All this time, Captain Monzein has been waiting for you to return. He's spent both time and effort in coming up with a way to bring you back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Enough with that. You've caused enough harm already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You have a duty to the Holy Guard to return and make amends for your actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You are yet to grasp the reality behind the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Right now, the Holy Guard is being utilized by a small elite faction within the Holy Order called the Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I have no intention of returning to the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The Corpse...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It's about time you faced the reality of your circumstances! The Holy Guard has been transformed into a weapon of destruction that threatens this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Why...? Why have you become so distorted in your thinking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Tsk. I knew you wouldn't have the ears to listen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>If you insist on passing us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Then you'll have to defeat me first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I have no choice then. I'll have to put you two to sleep for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>His power of darkness is even stronger than before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Huzzaaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...! He blocked it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>It's useless. You cannot stop...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...Ugh! Hwwoooohh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Ughh...! Im-impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Come back to us, Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>It's still not too late! Come back to us, Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I...can't stand by and watch my friend fall anymore!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>...Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I can feel your thoughts etched deeply in my heart. But...I am a knight who serves to protect this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>In order to protect this world...sometimes it requires a sacrifice of innocent blood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>...! No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>...Ack...! Huzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...! No! I'll aid you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Forgive me, my beloved friends! The world of peace that we once sought together...with my own hands...I will make it come to fruition!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>The End!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>?! ...Agh...ghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Ack...hahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Huff...huff... Try not to think too badly of me. Sleep here for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Ugh... It...it's not over yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>...! You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I-I won't let you go! This is a battle...to stop my fallen friend!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Stop... If you continue any further...I won't be able hold back...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Se-Seida...use your bow to stop Kudan's movements! I'll use that opening to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>...?! Wh-what is this?! I can't move my body...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Shadow Blend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You won't be able to move for awhile. I won't have you getting in his way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Captain Kudan, you're not alone...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>If...you...insist...on...standing...in...my...way...I...won't...hold...back...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>...! Have you lost your sanity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Die!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Ack?! N-no...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Ug-ughh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Well, you're quite the handful, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>An eye for an eye... I guess you can say darkness for darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>We have the same power of darkness. The effects of darkness won't work on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Basheeny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Who are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Nice to meet you. I'm Basheeny. I am an assassin hired by Lord Waginau to acquire the Holy Sword Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
