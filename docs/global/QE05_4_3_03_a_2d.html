<td>No, no, this is just what we needed. I had no idea that a fortress like this was up here.</td>

<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>Ah, yes. Even I was surprised to find out about this place. It was built over a hundred years ago, but it still stands strong. It will make a good stronghold.</td>

<td>The general who built this place was very shrewd indeed. I seem to have forgotten his name, however...</td>

<td>In any case, allow me to give you a tour. Please do feel free to stay here as long as you like, to recover from your journey.</td>
