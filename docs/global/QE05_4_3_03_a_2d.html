<td>Your Highness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Marie! You're all right! Thank goodness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ahem. Um... Should we give you two some privacy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Aha...haha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh! I do apologize. I did not mean to let my emotions get the better of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I bid you all welcome. You are guests here. I am only sorry that we cannot offer you better accommodations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No, no, this is just what we needed. I had no idea that a fortress like this was up here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ah, yes. Even I was surprised to find out about this place. It was built over a hundred years ago, but it still stands strong. It will make a good stronghold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The general who built this place was very shrewd indeed. I seem to have forgotten his name, however...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>In any case, allow me to give you a tour. Please do feel free to stay here as long as you like, to recover from your journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Thank you very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh? What was that just now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Mocca? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm not sure... I guess I'm just imagining things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We're entering the city! The main road is open!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Onward! There is no time! We must reach the main force heading into the Desert Zone before their orders arrive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What is it, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's midday, during peak market season. I would have expected there to be more people here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Is it not a result of His Highness' name being used to aggressively conscript soldiers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Even so, it is strange that there are so few people here... Perhaps they were evacuated beforehand, orâ€”?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Aaarrghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>An ambush?! It seems they've figured out you're here, Kamui. All troops, beware of hidden enemy soldiers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>They may be hiding around corners, or in the buildings, lying ready beneath the windows!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I feel uneasy about this.</td>
