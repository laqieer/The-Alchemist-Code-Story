<td>A hidden passage, huh? Saved us from being roasted. I guess you have your uses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Shut up. It's about time you were of any use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Are you worried about Ethan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Don't worry. He holds the single key to solving the mystery of the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They won't do anything too rash to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's not that. I was feeling apologetic towards Ethan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Apologetic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ethan must have entrusted me with Alkemono expecting me to protect the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yet, far from protecting it, I allowed it to get stolen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There you go again. Don't you remember what you said to the redhead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If you have the determination not to give up maybe you could even change this world...isn't that what you said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If you're going to contemplate anything, shouldn't you focus on the future rather than the past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hmph. I guess you can be useful at times too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Shut up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Squeak! Squ-squ-squeak!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Guard Droids?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No, it's something called the AJ2000! Not good. That thing is pretty strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ho-how many of them are there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You mean the security is tighter down here than above ground? Interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yep. This place reeks of being the hiding place for something important!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Looks like we might find Ethan earlier than we expected, little lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well then, let's put on a show! The battle begins!</td>
