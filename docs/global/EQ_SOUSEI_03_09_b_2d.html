<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Huh?! Wh-what's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Emmel! Mira! Are you alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh? Brother? With Nyx and the others, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's good you seem to be unharmed...but where's Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>She was taken off somewhere by that Icona person...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So we're too late...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Tch...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But how do you plan to escape from here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Magil is inhibited within this facility, so if we can't even use magic well—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Taking out all of the Engineer Soldiers on the premises with only Nimul's special technique is preposterous, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I have an idea. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>An idea...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Speaking of which, you were picking up parts from that destroyed security device a minute ago, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You remember how I mentioned that I was the one who developed the Engineer Soldiers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>In other words, I was entrusted with the fudamental design of most the autonomous machines here in this floating city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So I'm very knowledgable about the control center for them. So now, if we just do this—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>NEW ORDERS ACCEPTED.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...So you overwrote the thoughts of this Engineer Soldier and made it change sides?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yep! I do sort of get the feeling that I've got one foot outside the bounds of the law though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>With this, the battles within this facility should be a little easier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...Still, we're in trouble. If what Mira said is true, it's possible that Emmel isn't even here anymore. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If that's true, then what should we do? Staying here won't help our odds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...For now, all we can do is temporarily drop out of sight. From there, we'll have to track down Emmel somehow. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But are you suggesting we hide here? We're totally isolated and helpless right now. And our airship is surely under the enemy's control. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hold on, let's think about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...So we need someone who would take us in even knowing the danger it poses... If only we had some means of contacting Minario—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ah...! We've stayed in one place too long! Nimul, how can we escape from h—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You seem to be in a pickle, my friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Minario...?! Why are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What do you mean why? I came to help you guys, of course. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I had gone to all the trouble of pulling strings with a connection in the Special Detectives hoping to quietly extract you all from here, but... I guess what you've done works too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yeah... Sorry about that. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Nah, don't sweat it. It's my fault for being slow to mobilize. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well, no use regretting anything now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Everyone, stay quiet and follow me. I'll take us to a hideout I have for times like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Seems we have no choice but to take him up on this favor. Let's go, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hmm, I see... By regulating your lineage, it's been possible to expand the maximum amount of magil you can handle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Applying selective breeding to humans... Hah, even in this region we haven't stooped to that yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...What do you plan to do with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hmm? No plans, really. I also have no intention of subjecting you to anything painful, so please relax.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>All I want is to conduct research. On you all, the Sephira people, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>In an era far back in the past, your people were able to contain the Cursed Beast with the aid of Dragon's Blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Your reign was basically, perfection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Sins were contained. Corruption was erradicated. It can easily be stated that this was the most prosperous land in the region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Our...region?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It seems you never realized the utopian state you'd been living in. It's time to wake up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But I don't blame you. You'd never seen or known about the rest of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>By only seeing one side of the fence, you never had anything to compare it to. And so everyday life continued as normal for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It's a little like me and the people of the Acedia Belt conducting our research and living in our own bubbles for a long time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What are you trying to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It's simple. You've finally left your nest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>And now it's time to make your decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>A decision...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Basically, are you willing to team up with me, Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Your abilities are crucial to achieving my goals, and together we can bring peace back to this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...can't?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast is not to be controlled by human hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>To do such a thing... To have a mortal to do a godlike deed... It's inconceivable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I figured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But people are naturally bound to make mistakes. There are crossroads to face and even the wisest person in the world is going to trip and fall some time in their life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>That's right. The people of Sephira chose to live this way by not involving ourselves in sinful conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>So you're saying it's fine that people should be controlled by something more powerful than man? Is that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I'll let you in on a little secret, Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You see, this clock tower...is alive!</td>
</tr>
