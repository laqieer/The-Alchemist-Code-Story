<td>Captain! It's the Holy Guard! They appear to have noticed our movements!</td>

<td>That was quicker than I anticipated. Our intention is not to engage in combat with the Holy Guard, but our highest priority is to hold an audience with the King.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Avoid combat as much as possible. We must not be the first to draw our swords.</td>

<td>Yes, Sir!</td>

<td>It will be one tough march to the castle. Forgive me, my fellow knights.</td>

<td>What does King Patrick think of all of this? Will it really be all right?</td>

<td>Don't worry. His Majesty and I have fought side by side and faced death together.</td>

<td>But...this situation could lead to a misunderstanding! Depending on how he views it, the king may alsoâ€”</td>

<td>It'll be all right. The bond between me and the king is not one that is so fragile. Trust me.</td>

<td>The day I was baptized at the convent. I was nervous about whether I would do well as a nun, and you said the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Before you sent me off, you said, 'Trust me.' Do you remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Did I say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes! It gave me something to believe in while I lived in the convent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I have your words to thank for that, father.</td>

<td>Hehe... Ever since then, your words "trust me" have been a magic spell that brings me peace of mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>D-don't be silly! It wasn't my doing... You found those answers on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hehe... In any case, I will trust your words, father. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>In-Indeed. Let's!</td>
