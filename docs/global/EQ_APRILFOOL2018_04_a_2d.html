<td>Seida! Whoo-hoo, you're finally here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Don't "whoo-hoo"' me, Kanon. How long do you think we looked for you? Look how far you are from the rendezvous point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Whoopsies! So, listen, there were more monsters than we expected, so... I mean, we just had to retreat at once. We just had to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No more excuses. It is inefficient, mandra.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ack. I guess some things don't change, eh? Didja come alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...I'm here as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>In any case...from here on, the 2nd Regiment will accompany you of the 4th Regiment. Where is the main army led by Captain Kudanstein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>He's, uh, doing his intense fighting thing in the grasslands up ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We heard that the mission was to search for and immediately interrogate factions that are causing conflict within Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Then we must hurry and rendezvous with them. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I can feel a sinister presence in the wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Did you have someone in mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No, but what about that group, ya know? That one group that Captain Kudan and the 4th Regiment is looking for? I kinda forget why.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Right! They could be the source of this sinister presence that Seida is talking about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>True. There's a possibility of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Let's head to the Wind Temple, quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wait! I told you that we should first head to Gluttony!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There is a sinister presence at the wind shrine! I'm certain that the 4th Regiment has headed that way as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We are the Holy Guard. We exist to maintain peace within the continent. If the Sacred Stone in Gluttony were to be stolen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's not there! I am certain of it! The Sacred Stone is not in Gluttony!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Whoa... I'm kinda getting the feeling that Seida knows where the Sacred Stone really is. I'm right, right? Right? Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>At this point, it'd be inefficient to hide the truth, mandra.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...the safest place in all the world to hide the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wh-where...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Inside the Holy Guard or, more precisely, me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No fricking way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Seida...I can't even begin to imagine the kind of resolve you must have had in your everyday life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(Yo, everyone's so tense. This is all way too much for a laid-back bird like me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Uh-oh! Incoming!</td>
</tr>
