<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>All those Jam... Gone. Without even breaking a sweat...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm here, as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Glurrrrrp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I will someday become the Wind Sprite, so you can rest easy knowing that Saga is in our hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Tamis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I still don't have full control over Matter, but I will master it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Mocca won't be able to leave Saga without worrying unless I do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Total annihilation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Now, Tina... We can finally talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Mocca has told me everything. She's going on a journey to find a cure for her curse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What are you going to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Like I said before; there is no way that you alone can shoulder the fate of all Saga. Do as you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Just know that you did save Saga, so we will lend you whatever help you need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Besides, you are forgetting something very crucial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Something...crucial?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes. You have not saved all of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Mocca...is a part of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Until her curse is lifted, you cannot say that your quest is complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Y-you're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's the spirit! But, never forget, Tina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You, too, are part of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Mocca is a part of Saga...as much as I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Without saving Mocca, you have not yet saved Saga. Can you live on in Saga, knowing that Mocca did not make it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I wouldn't be able to live like that! I want to live in Saga, hand in hand with Mocca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, then... The answer is obvious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Tehre is right. You can leave Saga to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You've honored Alia. Saga will soon have its Sprite Quartet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We must repay you for that honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I would be relieved if you were by Mocca's side. I'd be able to focus on defending Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We will support the choice you make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You can leave the Toxotes to me. Know that you've done a deed that moves me to take action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Any objections?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Why...? Why would you all...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We figured you needed a little push to face your own feelings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Go, Tina... Go and save the piece of Saga that is still under threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I will get stronger so that Mocca does not have to worry. That's the path I choose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>So... Please, walk the path you choose, Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Is everything here settled already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hahahahaha! Too late, Mocca! Saga is safe, even without you! Leave everything to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Miss Tina...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I...want to go with you, Mocca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Please forgive me for leaving Saga, everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But I do promise to help Mocca find a cure for her curse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>So that I may save all of Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wh-what?! But, Tina... You have your duties as Chief!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I cannot make you take this journey alone. I just don't want you to be alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>So...I will go with you. That is what I truly want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Tina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Let's go together and find a cure for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Can we...really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I can't just leave you to go off by yourself. We are friends, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Tina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Let's do this together. Let's see Saga get rebuilt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Th-thank you, Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm sure you'll find a cure, Mocca. Come back when you're free of the corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Until then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yeah, I'll be back, Tamis. Until then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Please take care of Mocca, Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You can count on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'm so happy for you, Miss Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Thanks Lisbeth. I can face my feelings thanks to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Won't you come with us, Lisbeth? You'd be a great asset to have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Thank you, Miss Tina, but I've already chosen another path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I'm going to stay in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I want to learn how Voda manages her powers. I know that will help me to achieve what I really want to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I see, so that's what you meant earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>As you can see, there are so many here willing to be there for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Go on your journey. You have nothing to worry about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Right! Until the day we return...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Please, take care of Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>(Father... Please watch over us.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>(It's difficult for me to leave the land of Saga which I love so much...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>(But there is something that I need to do.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>(I want to help my friend.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>(I will trust in the bonds I've made in Saga, and begin a new journey.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>(No matter where I am, my heart will forever be in Saga. I will always feel the winds of Saga.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>(This is my home, so please, watch over me, Father.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Badalf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I won't see you for a while, but I promise to return!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>So keep Saga safe while I'm gone, Badalf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Saga, my dearest home, I will sing praises of your deep, green pastures...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Until the day I return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I'll be back soon.</td>
