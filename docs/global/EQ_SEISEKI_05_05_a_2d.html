<td>Tsk! From the way he appeared...I can't believe that Zain really... Why, Zain?!</td>

<td>!!!</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...what are you doing during an inefficient time like this...there's a limit to how inefficient you can be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Seida!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I don't understand it. At a time like this... Do you understand what is going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'd ask you the same. Why do you swallow everything that Zain says?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't you want to confirm the truth for yourself?!</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Teacher, this guy really doesn't have an ear to listen.</td>

<td>You said that you would open your eyes...that you wouldn't let their sweet words sway you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Then let me ask you this...can you believe Zain's words?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Zain's words? Of course, I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Why are you so sure?</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Teacher, no...you can't get through to this guy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What exactly happened to you, Captain Kudan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Agh! I don't have time for this! Kagura is in danger even now.</td>

<td>This is an emergency situation, where the world's existence hangs in the balance. Captain Kudan...I've come to stop you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I've come to stop you too, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ack! I won't be held responsible if something were to happen to you!</td>

<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Mistress, what are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What do you mean? Somebody knocked me out. They hit me on the back of my head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No...mistress, you were sleeping on your own...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Seriously! Don't act like I was just taking a nap or something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Somebody hit me from behind. I wonder who it was?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I don't know! In any case, we need to stop Captain Kudan! Let's hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Whatever you say, mistress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Seriously! Didn't I tell you to call me Kanon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Kanon... The Paladin that went to rescue Chihaya with Kudanstein...</td>
</tr>
