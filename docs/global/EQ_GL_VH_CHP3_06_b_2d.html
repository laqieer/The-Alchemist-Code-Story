<td>A loud alarm sounds off somewhere in the depths of the tunnels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hey! What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's that demon girl's cell! Gods, she'd better not have broken out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You need to leave. Now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Not going to surrender me to your masters?</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ugh...what a damned mess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Looks like she's gone nuts again. At least nothing is actually on fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Tch. More work for us to do...</td>

<td>Don't touch me.</td>

<td>That concludes my report, Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>And yes, all the information regarding Atropos's Core, as well as its method of reactivation, has already been compiled for you.</td>

<td>Unlike some people, I take pride in seeing a job to the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You sure made a mess in Greed Dike doing so. Extensive measures were taken to silence the populace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Take care you do not jeopardize our organization while flaunting your firepower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hoooh? Far better than being a glorified doll whose tin-can soldiers had failed to guard even two simple prisoners!</td>

<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Sit down, Li Wang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Of course, of course. My apologies, Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>We will come to that later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We may have Atropos now, but we are still missing the two keys to unlock the puzzle that is Lachesis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Without her, Atropos is but a mindless Construct, devoid of sentience and body both.</td>

<td>Soren and that little girl cannot be suffered to run loose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What do you make of it, Doktor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The head researcher casts a nervous glance around the room, lingering on Eliza for a brief moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The experiments may have...certain unforeseen flaws due to factors outside of laboratory control, Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Namely that of...of the host's individual capacity for emotional response.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>This isn't something we can definitively control while the subjects remain active agents on the field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>The Director taps a heavy finger rhythmically upon the hardwood desk, as if measuring a response.</td>

<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Grimm I.</td>

<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Yes, Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
