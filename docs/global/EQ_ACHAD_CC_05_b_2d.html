<td>I was stuffing my face with delicious, red fruit. It didn't taste like blood at all. It made my remaining eye sparkle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>And all the while, you were watching me, smelling sweeter than any fruit ever could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You showed me a dream that could never come true. No matter how badly I wished it would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And in my state of half-waking, I heard a voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>When are you going to stop toying with the poor girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I can't get your prediction out of my head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I told you, it's hit-or-miss. It might not come true at all.</td>

<td>She wants to be with you, you know. To share in your dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No matter how unlikely that dream is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You actually managed to make one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It was a success. We created a lump of Alchemia infused with dimensional power. I've integrated it into her prosthetic eye. You should tell her it's from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Just me? We did this together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Surely you don't want to make her feel more indebted than she already does?</td>

<td>Open your eyes.</td>

<td>Acht.</td>

<td>Is her body okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It should be; all she did was sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Sleep is good for growing girls.</td>

<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It sure is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You know, sometimes you two sound like a married couple.</td>

<td>I've been resting for so long, my abilities have stagnated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't worry about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Will I even be of any use like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm here because I want to fight alongside you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It made my remaining eye sparkle.</td>

<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Then I will become your weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yours and yours alone. The Templars' Number Eight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You showed me a dream that could never have come true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm hungry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>A few months later - Holy Order of Babel</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>And finally, as for the eradication of the Templars...</td>
