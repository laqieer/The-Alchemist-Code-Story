<td>I'm so sorry it took us so long to find you, Lord Naofumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It didn't take you long at all. You did a great job finding me, Raphtalia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Of course—I need to be by your side at all times as your sword. I knew that I would have to find you, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I had faith that you would rise up against the Wave to protect everyone in this world, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You are the Shield Hero, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Raphtalia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey, Mel, who're all these people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>They're the people from this world who are helping us fight the wave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, that makes sense. Hiya, everyone! The name's Filo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's a pleasure to meet you, Filo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>These monsters keep popping up out of nowhere. It's never-ending...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We really have to keep doing this until we take down the boss? What a pain... It actually upsets me that you have to deal with this so often.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We're not so fond of it either... The Waves keep on ruthlessly taking away what's most important to people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I don't want any more people to have to suffer at the hand of these Waves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Raphtalia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The villagers here have been so kind—they helped us try to find Lord Naofumi and Melty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I even got some snacks from an old lady! Everyone here is so nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>They've been incredibly kind to us even though we're just strangers... The people here are too good—there isn't an ounce of hatred against demi-humans or monsters... That's why we need to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't worry—I'll protect them. I need to do my part as the Shield Hero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But we need to lure out the boss somehow in order to do that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Naofumi, look behind that Balloon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I knew it. Use your light magic, Raphtalia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I am the source of power, and I command you to heed my words. Light spring forth—First Light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>There's a face floating in that Balloon's shadow... The way it's smiling is so disturbing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There it is! Attack the shadow at the foot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Haaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's a Soul Eater!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I didn't think we'd run into one here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>SYAAAAA!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I can't believe such a huge monster can hide in the shadows of a Balloon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's the Wave's boss! We'll be able to suppress the Wave if we defeat it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
