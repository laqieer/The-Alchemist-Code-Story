<td>We need to defeat the keeper of this ruin to get that jewel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You mean Sis can't go back unless we get it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I suppose there's nothing I could say that would keep you from heading towards that thing alone, Macherie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hahh... Hahaha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Honestly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(How can I defeat an opponent that my blade can't pierce, while also keeping Macherie and Jayme safe?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(Could I defeat it if I was alone? Probably not...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(Then what should I do?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(Until a little while ago, I wouldn't have even thought about fighting unless it was an assignment.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I told Jayme that hesitation would only dull his blade, but look at me now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Setsuna, there must be something I can help you with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I cannot allow either of you to come to harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This is my trial to overcome. I cannot let you do this alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Shouldering a burden alone is no different than torturing yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Macherie...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(She is willing to confront me about something I am trying to keep her from doing. She really is a tough one.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(I shouldn't allow myself to be dependent on them, but it would be wrong of me not to trust in them.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>All right, Macherie. Fight with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Your ability to see beyond sight can help me see through things that I wouldn't be able to otherwise. It might help us find a way to defeat this thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Right! Thank you, Setsuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Still, if it gets too dangerous, I want you to take Jayme and get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Jayme, make sure you look after her, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Got it! I can protect Sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Good answer. The three of us can do this together. We'll be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(With these two by my side, I can finally...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Grr...garhh...grrraaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Setsuna, here it comes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Right! I'm counting on you, Macherie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I will show you what I can do!</td>
