<td>As the monsters are gone, we shall continue with our practice. Allow me to remind you that you cannot use magic. Understood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I will be taking a look around the perimeter to make sure there are no more monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(This area isn't where monsters live. Aren't they supposed to live in forests?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Phew, glad we made it through! Right, Alma?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well, I guess we got our exercise in before eating, at least... Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Urgh... My stomach...hurts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Me too. Ever since I tasted the stew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Really? Oh no. You all did all that with a stomachache? Are you two all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I feel fine. And you seem fine too, Lisbeth? I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(She's...smiling?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We'll swap out the other groups' herbs with this and take everyone else out. How about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(No way! She didn't... Did she really swap out the herbs in all the madness earlier?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(She really went and did something so petty. But tattle-telling on her won't lead to anything interesting.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(And that herb isn't that toxic, so it'll be fine if I let things go on as they are.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Urgh... Ow, ouch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hey? Are you okay? Where does it hurt?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Recovery magic! ...That won't work! I haven't learned any magic that'll heal stomach pain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hey, calm down, Lisbeth. You can't use magic during practice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If you use magic, you might lose points. Is that what you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Now's not the time to be worrying about something like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Why... Why does she care about other people this much?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(I took it for granted that all witches would resort to anything to become elite.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>(That's what all the witches I met were like.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(But this girl might be different from the others.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wait! Why are you okay?! That's weird!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I don't know. Maybe you all messed up when cooking yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, weren't you at our cooking station when the monsters came?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You! You didn't put something in our stew, did you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I saw her over there, too! So what's your explanation for this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huh? What? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Sigh... Why don't you just give up and tell the truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I-I... Yeah... That's right. You said that we should use this opportunity to mess with the other groups.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>A-Alma was the one that told me to do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What are you talking about?! I would never do that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I could see Alma doing that. She's always standing off to the side, never really bothering to talk to any of us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>And her grades aren't that good either... Maybe she did it to improve her grade in this class. Urgh... Hurts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(I knew this wasn't going to end well. Ugh. This is so annoying.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Sigh... So if I gave the command, I should just apologize, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Why do you have to apologize, Alma? You can't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh?! Wh-what's with you all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Well, I know for a fact that you would never do something like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>N-never? Why are you so sure about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Because you're not a bad person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You came to help me carry the firewood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>And you noticed the small scratch Matthew had that he even didn't notice he had!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Because you're kind! So there's no way it could've been you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Besides, it doesn't matter why their stomachs are hurting right now! Healing them is much more important right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Th-that's true, but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>So everyone! Eat the stew we made! It'll heal you in a flash!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh? You wanna give it to them? But it's our assignment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yeah! Is that all right with you two?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It's fine with me, but what about you? We put a lot of effort into it and it's perfect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Of course it's fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>B-but! If we give everyone some, the stew will be all gone! At least let the teacher grade it first...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Geez, now's not the time to talk about practice when everyone's feeling so terrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Besides, the stew came out great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It should be eaten while it's hot. Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(If it were graded, it would've been our first step towards becoming an elite witch.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>(Eating the stew while it's hot is more important? Seriously?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Insects?! At a time like this?! They're crawling all over the place! So gross!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Why are there insects here?! They're not supposed to be aggressive! They're only supposed to attack if they're attacked first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Shoo, go away! Wh-why are they only coming towards me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Yui is getting surrounded by insects! I have to save her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Wait, how is you jumping into things going to help?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>But I can't just leave her to fend for herself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>(Can't leave her? But if it means sticking your neck into danger... That's crazy.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>(It's crazy, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>(She's serious.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Grrrah, fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Alma, it's too dangerous! We should call the teacher...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Hiyah! You're right, but I jumped in the fray before I realized I was going to!</td>
</tr>
