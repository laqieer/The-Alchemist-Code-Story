</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>Of course it's fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>B-but! If we give everyone some, the stew will be all gone! At least let the teacher grade it first...</td>

<td>Besides, the stew came out great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>

<td>Uh...</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/n_alma.png" alt="Alma" height="128"><br>Alma</td>

<tr>
<td>Classmate A</td>
<td>Insects?! At a time like this?! They're crawling all over the place! So gross!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>Why are there insects here?! They're not supposed to be aggressive! They're only supposed to attack if they're attacked first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Shoo, go away! Wh-why are they only coming towards me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>

<td>Wait, how is you jumping into things going to help?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>

<tr>

</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Classmate A</td>
<td>Alma, it's too dangerous! We should call the teacher...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
