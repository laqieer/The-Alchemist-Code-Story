<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Sabareta! We've occupied the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Of course. If we match our strength, there's no village we cannot liberate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Amazing! We've hardly suffered any casualties!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This is the power of Alchemy! With the Philosopher's Stones, we can also wield Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes. We'll use this power to regain the majesty of proud and honorable Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This we will achieve in the not very far future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hurrah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Where's Vanekis? Have you found General Neville's keepsake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>There's been no report yet. I believe Lady Vanekis is searching the General's manor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Bad news, sir! Soldiers from Envylia have laid an ambush in General Neville's manor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?! No! Vanekis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Vanekis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sa-Sabareta..! N-no...! Don't come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Agh! You dogs! Hold on, Vanekis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He-here, the sword...take it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So, this is General Neville's Ice Snake. Well done, Vanekis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>G-go now...quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You're wounded!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I-It's too late to save me. I'll just be a burden to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Unfortunately, as your commander, I'm the one who gets to decide that. Caesar!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Aghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Vanekis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Th-this is pointless. What if there are casualties?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Regular humans won't hurt them. You know that, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I...failed you, at the very end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't worry, Vanekis. Your sacrifice will serve to increase our power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>So...I-I'm also going to become a Philosopher's Stone, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You knew about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm an informant. Don't...underestimate me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I-I'm happy...I could help you...in some way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>B-but, even if it were just for a moment... I wish I could've witnessed,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>the ideal world that you will create.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You will. Your soul will continue with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Is someone there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Over here, Sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Vlad's at the front. Bring the black knight here without him noticing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Did that informant die?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes. However, as you can see, we've obtained the sword Ice Snake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>General Vlad, I give this sword to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Please use this Philosopher's Stone to revive Neville.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The one most suitable to pour their humiliation, suffering, and bitter anger into the Philosopher's Stone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's you, General.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>All of you, listen up! The time is ripe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>We Knights of the Royal Order and the Lizard Brigade will together begin our counterattack against Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You are the sword of proud and honorable Wratharis! Do not fear death, for we wield Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Even if death finds you, your souls will remain with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Like General Caesar the Demon Flame, you will be resurrected even in death and return to tear those dogs of Envylia to pieces!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hurrah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Glory to the people of Wrath! Wratharis! Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That is how it should be. An army that does not fear death...this is what I was seeking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The blood you shed will turn into Philosopher's Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It will all be used to resurrect the ancient weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I will never stop until we achieve a life of peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Now, let's go! A new history begins today for this continent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hurrah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Twenty years ago, our Kingdom of Wratharis was destroyed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Long we've laid low, hidden in the forest, quenching our thirst with swamp water!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But, at long last, those days of hardship are finished!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>With the power of our wrath, we will destroy the tyrannical, traitorous Kingdom of Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hurrah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>It's all gone according to plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yes. For three years, I've continuously stored my power within the Philosopher's Stones. Finally, this day has come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>With three years worth of Alchemia, Neville's strength will be immeasurable when he is transmuted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Reporting, Sir! Envylia's scouts appear to be heading this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>General Vlad, I leave this to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Very well. Go and fulfill your purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>All right. We begin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I can see Vlad clearly from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Wh-what's this? Someone's infiltrating Ford Aldrin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Who are those brats?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>That blue flame coat of arms...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Arghhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>In-inconceivable! How can two brats like you trample on the hopes of Wratharis?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>However, you have only stoked the flames of rebellion! Our wrath will become a fire that engulfs the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Feel the power of wrath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I summon you, hero of Wratharis...with all the life left in me. Hurrah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Burning flames of wrath...the blue flame coat of arms... It's just like that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Death to Zeke and Patrick! Destruction to Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>So...Vlad, you've finally given up the ghost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You sacrificed your power and ultimately your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I witnessed how brilliantly you succeeded in transmuting Neville with your last act.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>And, now, you are one of my pieces on the board.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Soon, I'll resurrect your soul from hell with this Philosopher's Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Lo-Lord Sabareta, General Neville has...been defeated!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>So, House Crowley's brats have somehow managed to obtain Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Hehe...hyahahah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>The descendants of those who turned into religious dogs and hunted down Alchemists have now gained the forbidden power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Again, the power of Alchemy appears to attract conflict in this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Is it glory that awaits them, or ruin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>The wheel of fate has begun to turn. The era of chaos begins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>With anger rooted in his heart, one man attempted to change the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>His unwavering will brought about the utter devastation of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>The wheel of fate he set in motion, even now continues to move the destiny of many.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Is it dazzling glory that awaits them, or ruin steeped in despair?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>That answer rests in the unknown future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Agh...! Where am I? I'm back here again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Heheh... How ironic for an Alchemist to be transmuted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Well, someone went through the effort to resurrect me. Depending on their reasons, I may lend them a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Well then...tell me about your naive dream.</td>
</tr>
