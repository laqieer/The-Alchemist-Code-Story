<td>Huzzaaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I will not forgive you! You will feel the pain of those whom you've stolen from!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wha—?! What is this?! A snake from...?! I-I can't move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Any last words, Hidden Ogre?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>How naive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Tch! Dammit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hahaha! Can't cut down your friend, pathetic human? This Blade Fox must be a collective of the incompetent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You have a unique power. I will let you live, and take you with me. But first...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I shall feed upon the Blade Fox!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No, you will not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Who...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hmph, how odd. I didn't think you'd have trouble with such a trifling foe, Amane. You bring shame to the Blade Fox.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Tch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't make me laugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wh-what?! How can he...?! Without hesitation...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Fool! Now that you've shown yourself, your mimicry is pathetically unavailing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I will kill all you demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Nnrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>How many more Hidden Ogres are there? Considering the extent of this chaos, you surely aren't the only one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You dare think I would confess to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No. Die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We must find the other Hidden Ogres. Disperse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You better hurry too, rookie. We can't let the chaos spread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>S-sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>H-how is it that you can be so decisive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That demon took on Azami's form, yet you showed no hesitation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Can you save a life with hesitation? Besides, the real Azami would have easily evaded that thrust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Um...sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What is it now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What if... What if you were bitten?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That is a foolish question. I would never allow myself to be bitten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But even if there was a one in a million chance I did, I would have my squad follow regulation and cut me down. That's all there is to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>A member of the Blade Fox that is bitten by a demon must be purged by their squad before they themselves turn into a demon. You didn't forget already, did you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Even if that member is crucial to the Blade Fox like you, Captain Ugachi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The regulations are absolute. There are no exceptions. If bitten, you are purged. That's it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'd much rather have a clean death than to become one who steals life from others. Do you not have the conviction to say the same?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>If you have no resolve, then you do not belong here. We don't need you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Remember this. Until we kill all demons, there will be no peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That is what we are here to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Rather die a clean death...than to become one...who steals life from others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>"Demons must be eradicated."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>My every day life could be...stolen...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I could become the one who steals it from others...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Rather die...than to become someone like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
