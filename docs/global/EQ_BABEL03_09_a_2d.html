<td>I will not allow any further transgressions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Nefertiti!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You did not come greet me as you usually do, so I thought I had better check in. Prepare yourself for punishment later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I-I...understand, beloved sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What is going on here, Nefertiti?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Rashba, members of the Corpse, please withdraw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I cannot do that. I will not leave without that Sephiran girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We will not harm anybody if she is given to us, and we will then gladly withdraw. You have been warned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>My oh my, then this is quite a troubling turn of events. We simply cannot allow any of you to have Carla.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wait, me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If you plan to take her by force, I will not stand idly by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Let us see if you have the strength to face me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>A Sephira? Me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Your parents must have kept it secret from you for your protection. I'm sorry, Carla.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That you have become a target is the fault of the nobility. That is why I must...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...protect you at all costs. Such is my burden to bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Balt, I'm... Did you...know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It never mattered to me who you are. I promised Hawk that I'd protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I will protect you and this desert with my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>May I...ask of you one thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes, though I will not accept any excuses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Nothing of the sort. Please, allow me to shoulder some of your burden. I wish to be of some help to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>My, you used to be such a disappointing little brother, but look at you now. So grown up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I've always regretted turning my back on Hawk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Back then, my hands were full with my own problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>However, things are different now. I stand here now, having protected the same things Hawk dedicated his life to protecting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That is why I am here. This is my atonement, my burden to bear. I cannot possibly let youâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I am no longer the little boy you still see me as! Do you still believe I cannot be of any use to you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We are family! Is it not natural for us to share the weight of what must be borne?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ramses...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So this is what you meant... Hawk, the seeds you sowed in this desert are finally bearing fruit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Are you seeing this, Hawk? It's just as you said. It may take time for seeds to sprout, but time is one thing the world will give us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The seeds you planted are sprouting right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Well, gosh darnit, I knew Hawk was right all along!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Nefertiti. I may have misjudged you. No, I probably just didn't believe in you from the bottom of my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>There is no need for you to be alone in this. Though we may be different in many ways, we both call this desert our home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We may not be family, but we work together. Is that not right, Nefertiti?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That's right! I mean, I'm still a little wigged out, but you didn't have to keep it a secret from me! Quit acting so standoffish and distant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I would have gladly shared this burden with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>How can you think like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I once knew a guy who passed away because he was determined to shoulder all the weight of the world alone. I just can't let that happen again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I...understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Let us help you! We'll start by getting through this fight together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Are you finished yet? Have you prepared to die, desert-dwellers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>We won't be dying on this day! Hey, Zofia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hm? Ya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You were born in this desert, right? I want you to know I want to protect you too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What are you talking about? She's mine! You're speaking out of place, fool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You're out of place! I'm talking to Zofia, not you! Zofia, let's make a bet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>If you win, well, that's the end of that, but if we win? You live as you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The way, Zofia...want? Live?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yeah, and come home to the desert someday. We'll have made this place a good home for you by then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It can be far in the future. It can be when you're an old lady. Just come home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>This is what it means to protect the desert. What do you think, Zofia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Okay! Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Zofia! Don't be making any stupid promises! Actually, forget it. We'll be annihilating them anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We won't lose to the likes of them. Will we, Carla?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Of course we'll win! For the first time, the Sand Hawks will fight along with the nobility! Let's do this, Balt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You can count on me! The desert is our home!</td>
