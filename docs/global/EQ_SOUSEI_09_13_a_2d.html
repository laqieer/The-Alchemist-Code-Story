<td>Bold, aren't they? Generally when one runs away, they try to get as far as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>But to hide right under our noses like this... They are determined, I'll give them that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mesarthim</td>
<td>It's no surprise. They didn't retreat with the intent to give up, but merely to regroup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mesarthim</td>
<td>And they've had ample time now to prepare their counteroffensive. It does beg the question, what are they plotting?</td>

<td>What, indeed...</td>

<td>Well, well. Is it just you I'll be facing, then?</td>

<td>You've hidden yourself well. It seems you've learned to take full advantage of your environment.</td>

<td>Matia</td>
<td>However, so long as you do not risk yourself in actual combat, nothing can truly begin or end. There is no winning unless your opponent loses.</td>

<td>What's this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_niku.png" alt="Nyx" height="128"><br>Nyx</td>
<td>You're definitely strong. But your strength is that of a warrior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_niku.png" alt="Nyx" height="128"><br>Nyx</td>
<td>And that's something I can take advantage of. If I slow you down with my techniques, then even the sharpest edge of your weapon will be far less effective!</td>

<td>Clever thinking. You have indeed exposed one of my vulnerabilities.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>It was a mistake to assume that you could completely neutralize my weapon like this, however.</td>
</tr>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_niku.png" alt="Nyx" height="128"><br>Nyx</td>
<td>What?!</td>
