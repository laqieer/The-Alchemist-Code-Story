<td>Bold, aren't they? Generally when one runs away, they try to get as far as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But to hide right under our noses like this... They are determined, I'll give them that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's no surprise. They didn't retreat with the intent to give up, but merely to regroup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And they've had ample time now to prepare their counteroffensive. It does beg the question, what are they plotting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What, indeed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There they are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Just as predicted. Leave the soldiers to me. Your role isâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The Shield Maiden, Mesarthim, I know. She will be dealt with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, well. Is it just you I'll be facing, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm more than enough. And I will stop you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I like your energy. Show me what you're made of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You've hidden yourself well. It seems you've learned to take full advantage of your environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>However, so long as you do not risk yourself in actual combat, nothing can truly begin or end. There is no winning unless your opponent loses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And that's precisely why we're not going to show you any mercy. But just remember: a battle's not won on firepower alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What's this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You're definitely strong. But your strength is that of a warrior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And that's something I can take advantage of. If I slow you down with my techniques, then even the sharpest edge of your weapon will be far less effective!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Clever thinking. You have indeed exposed one of my vulnerabilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Appreciate the compliment. It might only work once, but it works, and that's what counts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It was a mistake to assume that you could completely neutralize my weapon like this, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Come forth, avatar of Gluttony, and consume me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's another Cursed Beast phantom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Roooooaaaaaaaar!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Nngh... I guess it really was overly optimistic to think that would work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Fall back, Nyx! I'll purify that phantom with my Spiritbonding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Grrrrroooooaaaaar!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hmph. Shall we play a bit of hide-and-seek, then? I do rather enjoy the hunt, so I'm happy to indulge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Found you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Space-Time Manipulation?! Drat! It must be because the magil shifted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This is the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hmph. An interesting, if reckless, gambit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, don't worry, I've got plenty more up my sleeve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I used Space-Time Manipulation to make those arrows fly way faster! Not too easy to dodge them now, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>These arrows are...Alchemy...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Finally! We've got you now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I can't remove them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You're fast, and strong. We can't attack you head-on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>And while my skills can't ever measure up to Julia's, I can at least assure you that those arrows are going to burn you from the inside out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What?! Then I'll just have to kill you before they do!</td>
</tr>
