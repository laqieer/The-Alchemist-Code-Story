<td>Whoooaa!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We've got you now! How dare you ruin the dumpling tower I built!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Give us the dumplings back! Why would you even do this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>W-we were just so hungry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We figured as much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, I guess it couldn't be helped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wait, what?! Why?! We're letting them go?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I mean, they didn't do it out of malice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah, they were just hungry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This can't be right! Theft is wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, I forgot to tell you something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ahem...</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>To tell you the truth, moon-gazing isn't just about eating dumplings while looking up at the moon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The Gods told me of a custom honored during the event. It's called Moonlit Burglary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's where children try to steal as many dumplings as they can during the event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The more dumplings successfully stolen, the better the fortune.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So everybody should be smiling, even if dumplings are stolen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There are some households that go as far as to give away dumplings to children in the neighborhood. Doesn't that sound fun?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It does! So much fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So, they didn't actually do anything wrong in terms of the rules of this event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Why is this the first time we're hearing about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Sorry, I forgot about it until now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>B-but, Carol went through all that trouble to make them for us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'll just ask her to make some again. Oh! Or I could ask her how to make them so we can do it together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oooh! That sounds like fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's not fair! We worked so hard to get everything ready, and they just show up and... And...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We haven't had any of the dumplings ourselves yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh no, Evelika, are you hungry? I'm sorry I didn't notice. There's this really good cheese dog stand right around the...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's not the point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>And just so you know, cheese dogs aren't that great! They don't even match the theme of the night!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Come on, Evelika. You don't have to be so mad. Let's just have some fun tonight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Evelika...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Did I... Did I not look like I was having fun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I just wanted to make sure this moon-gazing went perfectly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I was having so much fun getting things ready with Hazel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Evelika?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Evelika!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wow, emotions are running high. Is the smell of the purple dumplings getting to you or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but we don't have enough to share.</td>
