<td>What do you think you're doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You are quite the swordswoman. I was planning to deal with you quickly if you bored me, but I should have expected more of a Black Star.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I was told to kill any who would interfere with Greed Dike, but... I'll just pretend I didn't see you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So you are connected to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes. I have my own obligations. Though I'm sick of watching so much corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...You're one of the Shiba Senko?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You must have noticed from my bladework. In that case, I don't need to explain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I can't allow someone from Wadatsumi to have dealings with Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wadatsumi cannot endure any more corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I agree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>With the demon threat under control, the greed of the Shiba Senko runs wild. They don't even to listen to me, the head of their clan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I didn't expect that from someone of the clan itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Even as one of the great houses of Wadatsumi, they rot to their core the more they refuse to listen to reason. It's only natural for corruption to accumulate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>However, as clan head, what I can do is limited. I can only impede the corruption, I cannot stop it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That is why I accepted this mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're contradicting yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Say what you will. I choose to lead the Shiba Senko in a way that I wouldn't be ashamed of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No matter how many lives I have to take.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Illogical things like clans and codes exist in all ages. That's why it is up to the individual to choose their own path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Their own path to honor the responsibility they were given.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't have that choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh? Even though you fight with such passion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I may have passion, but I am not free. That doesn't change what I have to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And you're willing to die for it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's right. Whatever it takes, whoever must die for it, whether be myself or another by my hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>For the sake of those I will leave behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And so you resist within your restrictions... I've taken a liking to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Should I care?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Maybe. Have you heard this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I can't imagine this is completely out of range of your interests. I have no reason to give you this information, but it is credible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Credible? You expect me to believe that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I've taken an interest in seeing where that passion of yours takes you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's up to you if you want to believe me or not. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I hope I get to see you use all of your strength the next time we meet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I suppose I have much to learn if you were able to tell I'm not at my best. That said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm surprised the Shiba Senko has decayed to such a point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Even as one of the great houses of Wadatsumi, they rot to their core the more they refuse to listen to reason. It's only natural for corruption to accumulate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>However, as clan head, what I can do is limited. I can only impede the corruption, I cannot stop it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That is why I accepted this mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It seems we are both clumsy fools held down by the duties that have been placed upon our shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>My own path...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(I wonder if my body will last long enough that I can make my dream a reality.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>This doesn't change what I have to do. I will do what I must for myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>And for my...code...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So this is where you were. I killed all the others! Does that mean I win this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Yeah... You win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yes!!! I've never won against you before! ...Natsume?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Natsume?! Wh-what's wrong? Natsume!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'll get you to a doctor. Just... Just hold on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>My time is limited, and yet I still have much left to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>But more than anything, I want Ren to be free.</td>
</tr>
