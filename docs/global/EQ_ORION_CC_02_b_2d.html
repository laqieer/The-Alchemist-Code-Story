<td>Oaaaaaaaaaghh!</td>

<td>A bit sloppy, but you've got the spirit, I'll give you that much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Like I said... Nobody gets to kill you but me. I won't surrender. Not to you, and not to Mammon.</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>I guess you could say, I'm through being a kitten. I've grown into a lion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oho, the kitty's got claws after all. You could call that its own sort of greed. But if you really are a lion...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well, perhaps I should be prepared to find your fangs at my throat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Now that you've taken off that boorish mask of yours, I'll be waiting for the day you strike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>As if I'd even have the chance. You'll never let me catch up to you. Don't even try to pretend you would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, of course not. But then, you're the one Mammon's sucking dry. My life energy remains largely undisturbed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's okay. I'll become just as strong as you and reshape this land into one that doesn't give in to Greed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Intriguing. Then we shall both struggle ever onward, together!</td>
