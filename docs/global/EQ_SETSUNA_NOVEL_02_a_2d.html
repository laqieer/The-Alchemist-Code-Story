<td>I told you. The sword is a part of your arm. Feel the tip of the blade with your senses, grip tightly, and swing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>G-got it! Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hm, your form is getting pretty good. Now try striking at me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>A-are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wouldn't it be kinda dangerous if I swung at you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hahah. You're a kind child, Jayme. But it's all right. You won't be able to hit me yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah, you're right. You're Setsuna the Awesome, after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's not a question of me being awesome. It's just that you're still at the beginning of your training. You have much to learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You're sort of an apprentice, like Macherie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Like Sis? All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Now, come at me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Here I go! Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(Jayme's strikes are refreshingly straightforward.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(Unlike how I was back then, they're beautiful and direct.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That day, I lost everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I ran and kept on running. Surviving all on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That day, I swore my vengeance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yet I would need more strength to take it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I recklessly swung my blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Those who knew no better would have seen it as a very honest, straightforward sort of sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But a sword swung for vengeance, no matter how straightforward, will never bring about a good end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Those who lose people whom they love can become twisted and lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I ran. I refused to connect with anyone new. I hid away from the reality that surrounded me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Setsuna...? Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hm? Oh...sorry. I was lost in thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm fine. Next, we'll...hmm, I'll strike back. Defend yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(Why am I thinking of the past?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(What do I hope to gain from this? There should be nothing more for me to—)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(What am I doing? I know all too well that distracting thoughts will only interfere with my bladework. What's wrong with me?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>S-sorry, Jayme. Are you all right? I guess this is still a little too much for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm okay! I need to get stronger for my sister!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(That's right. That's why he can be so strong.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(He wields his sword to protect.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(Why do I wield my blade?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Are you okay? Thinking about something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I was just admiring your natural talent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yes. Really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(Something to protect...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Setsuna, what's next?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hmm... I think this is enough strike practice for—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Everybody, run! Monsters in the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Monsters?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>S-Setsuna...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You'll be safe here. You know what? This is actually a good opportunity. Watch close and learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You're making this part of my training? B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Promise me one thing. Keep away from me during the fight. I don't want you to get hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What? Wait! Setsuna?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Got it? Just watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(It's not like my fighting style is anything special, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(To know the terror of combat, and learn when to retreat...to realize that it takes courage to do so...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Sssssss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hmph. So you won't run away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'll show you how foolish not being able to judge your opponent's strength can be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Taste of my blade!</td>
</tr>
