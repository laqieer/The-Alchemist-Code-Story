<td>GRAAAAAARGH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>GWAAAH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>W-wait, hold on... I was wrong, I admit it! Please, spare my life...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...Unforgivable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ah! M-my fingertips are crystallizing... S-stop! Anything but that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It was a lie, I swear! I just took her ribbon, I haven't touched her! I'm begging you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Celliers! You have to stop this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...M-Mielikki? Why are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I couldn't find you, so I came to look for you! I knew you had to be around here somewhere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I know you, after all. You like walking in the woods, don't you, Celliers? You and I strolled in the forest by the village time and time again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Mielikki...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Pull yourself together, Celliers! You can't do this... You can't use such a beautiful power for something like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh! I-I'm doing this to...a person?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You've got to rein in your power somehow! What you're about to do can't be undone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Y-yes, you're right! I have to stop it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No, I can't. I can't stop it... What do I do, what do I do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(Turning someone to crystal... That's an unthinkable act, I know as much...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(Even so, I'm taking this power Mielikki loves, and committing such an awful deed in front of her!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ah, ahhhhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...This isn't good. Celliers' mind has been thrown into disarray. If this goes on—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey! Celliers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wha—Mielikki?! S-stay away, it's too dangerous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No, it isn't! I can't control my power! I might turn you into crystal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This power, this awful power...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I said it's fine! I've worked my butt off for just this occasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huh?! What is this... It feels so warm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You know what, Celliers? Your power doesn't scare me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I mean, you always used it to save me, or to make other people happy, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I watched how hard you worked, making crystals that bring people joy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's why I love that power of yours—why I love YOU, Celliers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh! It stopped...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Thank you, Mielikki...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hell's bells, I'm finally done. I have no love for this sort of paperwork...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>How are things looking, Flamel? Can Mielikki return to the village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Indeed. The soldiers have all gone, and she's received permission to travel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The men who went after you will be forced back to their country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Is that so? I'm happy for her...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What do you mean, for her?! You're coming back with me, Celliers! That was the whole point of my training!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Training?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The truth is...while you were separated, Mielikki underwent training in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>S-Saga?! You went that far away, Mielikki?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yep! My magic is kinda unique. Not much I could do to improve myself at Sis' laboratory, from what they said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's when Flamel introduced me to a woman named Peridot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hmph... I see. Your power invokes the surrounding Alchemy, improving its very flow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Your penchant for growing vegetation seems to stem from this power as well. This is unlike any average magical technique.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>If you wish to develop this power, you should commune with the nature here, and undergo training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(...Still, I never expected that man to ask anything of me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(To think we'd remain connected like this, despite being unable to meet... Human connection is an esoteric thing, indeed.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>So that's what happened. Still, why did you decide to do all that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Because, Celliers... I couldn't stop you. Even after you got upset for my sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I wanted to do something for you in return. That's when Flamel said that I might be able to help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>That's right. When we first met, I could sense a special quality within her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Mielikki's sister also spoke often of her—how her sister's talent surpassed even her own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>We invited her into our ranks on multiple occasions, but were always refused. "I can't protect my flower bed if I'm in the capitol," she'd say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Well, duh! You know how important my flowers are to me! And besides, how am I supposed to stay calm in such an urban sprawl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I can't imagine my powers getting any stronger in a place like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Still, Mom always said to use my power for the things I really care about. That's why I made my choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The training was no joke, but all I had to do was look at the crystal you gave me to stay strong, Celliers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>After all, it was all to be with you—to back you up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Mielikki...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>So! That means we're going back together! Got it, Celliers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>B-but... Is it really okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I almost turned a human to crystal. How can someone like me live peacefully in that little village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>So long as it was an isolated incident, I see no cause for concern. I'm the only one who saw you, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>And I do mean isolated. We'll be in trouble if it happens again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Never fear, Mielikki's here! Me and Celliers, our powers are a perfect match, after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Wait, really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>She speaks true... Our research has shown that your power remains incredibly stable while you two are together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Your magic has the power to undo Celliers' crystallization, much like you did when healing that soldier. So again, no cause for concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Woohoo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>M-Mielikki?! Don't hug me out of the blue like that...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I'm just so happy! Don't you worry, Celliers! I'm here to protect you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Oh, uh, m-me too! I'll protect you too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>(...This is truly what it means to use your power for someone's sake. Celliers should be just fine from now on.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Now then, nothing up my sleeve... Aaand PRESTO!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Whoaaa, incredible! The flowers are all back to normal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>How do you like me now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Amazing... Huh? Is it just me, Mielikki, or do you seem kind of disappointed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Well... It's kind of a waste, to be honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I feel bad for the blooms that were turned into crystals, but the crystal flower bed was gorgeous, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Mielikki...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Oh... One of the flowers is on the ground! I bet one of those jerks broke it when they stomped around. Poor thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Let me see it, Mielikki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Okay, here you go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Oh wow, a crystal flower! Thanks, Celliers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>See, I said you had a beautiful power! I just adore it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Mielikki...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>(I hated this power of mine for so long—like an abominable curse that weighed heavily on my shoulders.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>(Even so, this power gave me a chance to meet Mielikki.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>(And now, it let me see her smile.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>...Thank you, Mielikki. I'll do all I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I've been saved by you over and over. Just like you went all out for me, I'll work hard for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Celliers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>After all...your smile means the world to me.</td>
</tr>
