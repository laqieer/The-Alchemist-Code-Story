<td>Why...why do you go out of your way to die?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Because that is love, Lisbeth.</td>

<td>The essence of love is self-sacrifice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Seeking the happiness of the one you love, without regards to what happens to yourself. That is true love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What an arrogant thing to say. Happiness cannot be bought with the life of a single individual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But what if it wasn't just one individual? I am the queen. I am loved by many vassals who have entrusted me with their love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The happiness of the queen is the future of the country. These countless lives will now become the cornerstone of this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Would you call such a noble sacrifice an act of arrogance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It depends on the one who the sacrifice is made for. Sacrifices made for a twisted individual can lead to the destruction of a country!</td>
