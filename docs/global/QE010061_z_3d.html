<td>Argh! Why does it disappear?! Perhaps, like Dias said, I still have doubts in my mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>He's continued to move forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yet, I remain the same, allowing the gap to widen between the two of us!</td>

<td>Don't be impatient, Logi.</td>

<td>Dad!</td>

<td>In order to avoid a situation where your heart is consumed by your power, you must make an effort to remain composed at all times.</td>

<td>We of the Blue Flame Guard head towards the ruins of Fort Mugarde, one of the two large forts within the territory of old Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sabareta should re-gather all of his troops there. We must capture it and rescue Agatha at all costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Don't doubt yourself, Logi. Instead, single-mindedly immerse yourself in the mission. In time, your hesitation will disappear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Okay, dad.</td>

<td>Reporting!</td>

<tr>

<td>A Paladin...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A report? What's occurred?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>A-at Fort Gilrack...the ancient weapon...the Demon was resurrected! The Holy Guard has been devastated!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The Demon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The ancient weapon?! Is that the weapon that Agatha said led to the demise of ancient civilization?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So, it truly did exist! If we do not take care of it quickly, it will have grave consequences. We must hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No, Sir. The Demon was defeated by Sir Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>However, the damage to our Paladins has been tremendous. We are currently requesting reinforcements to rebuild our army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That concludes our current status report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Dias defeated it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>He defeated the Demon on his own?! He didn't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What's the matter, dad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There is a possibility that the Lizard Brigade possess another Demon. Please be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We'll need to hit the Lizard Brigade's main force as soon as possible. Logi, let's hurry to the ruins of Fort Mugarde.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Dias took down a Demon on his own. He truly is amazing. As for me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's too much power...for Dias to wield on his own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>There's no time to feel depressed. We need to hurry. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Y-yes, Sir! Right... There's no time to hesitate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I can't let Dias shoulder any more burden than he already has!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Just you wait and see. I'm going to create a world where Agatha can be happy in!</td>
