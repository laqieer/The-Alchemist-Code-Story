<td>Hyaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oof!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Alright then. Now the villagers can live in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I suppose the monsters didn’t really want to attack anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I hope the mine can get back to normal soon, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What's wrong, Lucia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ewan is still so radiant. I can't wrap my head around it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>He is, isn't he? I think he finally realized his purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>His purpose, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(The miners, the bride and groom…and now Ewan…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(Maybe…what makes you shine is following your heart...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>…to help someone else…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Never would've thought those bandits were the reason for the monsters…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Don't worry. Once the forest returns to normal, the monsters will return to their natural habitat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But in case they come back, don't attack them. Start a fire instead. They're afraid of flames.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh? Will do! Thanks again for all your help. Please, take this as a token of our gratitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Felicitite! Can we really have it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's the least we could do. Once everything settles down, we can finally get back to work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Always remember "Safety first!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes ma'am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yippee! I can make a wedding knife with this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Weren't you struggling to come up with a design?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yeah… Actually, I still haven't worked out all the kinks yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I just can't seem to visualize anything that’s not a weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So, I'll stop fussing over that part and focus on the bringing joy part. That’s when ideas start to flood in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Like seeing the smiles on everyone's faces as they use my wedding knife!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Looks like you have all the inspiration you need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yep! Until now, all I could think about was what kind of weapon I would make…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But it's also important to consider "who" I'm going to make it for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Lucia…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh yeah! The more I talk about it the clearer it gets. I just know I'll make a wonderful wedding knife!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Alright! No time to waste! Gotta get started! And I need to do a few test cuts before I show you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>"T-Test cuts?" What are you going to cut? Wedding knives should only be used to cut cakes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wow... Glad to see her so animated!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You seem happy, Ewan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Do I? For you to say that means you must be too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I didn't think I'd ever be carefree enough to fully appreciate Lucia's passion for weapon making.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…Yeah. I'm glad to see you've come around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If her appreciation of the world has deepened without her losing herself…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>…Then I'm more than happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Well then…I think I'll join the party after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh? What a pleasant surprise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hm? Come on, a man is allowed to change his mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Although, I do think weddings are a bit out of character for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>But if I go on saying that I get the feeling I’ll get chewed out. Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I've got to see this through to the end--and see her creation bring a smile to everyone's face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Live, Love, Laugh, and be happy.<br>Wishing you all the best!</td>
</tr>
