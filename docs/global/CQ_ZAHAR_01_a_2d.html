<td>What's the battle situation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Our front army is overwhelming the enemy. Soon our other troops will arrive at their main line!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Heh. I see.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(The plan has succeed. We've won this battle.)</td>

<td>Reinforcements, huh? But what can reinforcements do in this current situation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Just handle them as you see appropriate.</td>

<td>The enemy's reinforcements number in much more than we expected and have halted our other troops headed towards the main line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(Instead of protecting their main line, they've attacked our other troops. Is this a coincidence?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(No. Whether it be coincidence or fate, it doesn't matter if the action is eradicated. More importantly...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>My strategy must be carried our perfectly. In order to do so, all obstacles must be eliminated.</td>

<td>Huzzaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Impossible! Did he just block one of my blows?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(What a fast blow. I just managed to block it, but, if I hadn't been fast enough, I would've been dead!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(This guy is incredible!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Captain Zahar, the sun is about to set.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
