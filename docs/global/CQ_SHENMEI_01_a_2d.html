<td>Whoohoo! I still totally haven't had enough to drink! Keep them coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>All right. I've brought you another round...of milk, not alcohol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Thanks, Vanekis! There's nothing more awesome than a beautiful and considerate barkeeper!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You make the occasional visit to the tavern worth it! That being said, my main goal of finding new crewmates seems like it'll end unsuccessfully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The fact that your energy levels are so high, even though you haven't had a drop of alcohol, is a talent unto itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well, I can't seem to find any new candidates for my crew and I don't know where the treasure is buried...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The whole situation is kinda touch and go. At times like this, a pirate has gotta keep smiling and being cheerful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Heheh. Well, you're one energetic pirate captain. In fact, I like your way of thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>By the way, the treasure you're looking for...is it actually nearby?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That I have no doubt of. It should be buried somewhere in the forests around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>In that case...you might benefit from talking with that gentleman seated over there. He's a woodcutter who's familiar with these parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Really?! I'll do that! Thanks, Vanekis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That lumberjack is a pretty hard-headed guy, but maybe Shenmei can pull it off...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Seriously! What's with that old man?! I was practically begging him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh dear, it looks like she was turned down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>He says to me, "I ain't telling no girls." Seriously! I should bring everyone from my ship here! But, he might run away before that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh well. Let me try my hand at it first. Hold on a second, Shenmei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hey, Vanekis?! There she goes... Is she gonna be okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting. Apparently, the treasure is located in the deep northwest of the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>H-he told you?! He turned me down even though I begged him so hard! Why did he tell you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I trade information as a side-business. I had some information he was interested in, so...well...I took advantage of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>W-wow, wow, wow! Vanekis, I had no idea you were an informant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>On top of that, you seem like you're really good at it! All right, I've decided! Vanekis, I want to scout you for my crew!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You want me to become one of your crewmates? Well, I'm flattered by the offer, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If you were to join my crew, not only will we probably find more treasure, but I think it'll be a lot of fun! So, what do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Come on! My pirate ship is awesome, you know? Every day is like a party!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hmm. Well, first of all, will you show me how skilled you are at being a pirate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>How...skilled I am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We arrived at the rumored forest! If I find the treasure here, you'll acknowledge my skill, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes. But don't push yourself too hard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ehem! Have no fear, Vanekis! I'll make you fall head over heels with just how much of a pirate I am!</td>
