<td>We're about to reach the deepest part of the cave. I wonder what we'll find...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh, look! A treasure chest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Th-There really is one! And it's glistening like gold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hey, you two! Don't get too close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What? But the treasure chest is right there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Something feels off. We should be cautious with something so dubious. Just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're right, Liu Shen. It is best we exhibit prudence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It seems there is more here than simply a treasure chest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're here! We've been waiting for you! You're the pirates that awakened the Great One.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Wh-What did you say?! The Great One? What're you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Don't waste your breath denying it! We already know it was you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We know foolish pirates greedy for treasure awakened the Great One when they raided his resting place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Thanks to you, we know that the teachings of our order were true! And the Great One... He exists!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Pirates hunting for treasure summoned the Great One...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...Could it be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This was once a place where a cult worshipped demons, though now it is a home to octopuses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Are you aware? Did you know that what was sealed here was a demon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Graaaaawr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Th-The remains of that octopus?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That is no octopus! It is the Great One! Through his guidance, you have been brought here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The codes used on the map were developed by our order long ago. That you could decipher them is proof enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh... Do you really think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Um, I uh... I just found how to read them in a book.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's a less known code, so not many people probably know about it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Xiao-Xiao is very studious, so she knew the old symbols used by the old defunct cult. It's impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We're not defunct! We were just waiting for this opportunity! And you fools played right into it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If we can call forth the Great One, you all will grovel before his majesty and splendor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That is why we spread fake treasure maps around to bring you here! Because you know how to awaken him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Greedy, insolent pirates will always chase after treasure. It was easy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>To manipulate others so selfishly... You are a disappointing lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Now, tell us the method for awakening the Great One! If you do not...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Of course... They have a magical device for the ritual prepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Did you notice something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes... While looking around, I found a hole not to be found in nature cut into the cave wall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Based on the alchemical residue, I'd assumed it was created by a weapon using some kind of magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Heh heh... Naturally, I have made preparations to deal with you savage marauders!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I approve of being well-prepared, but... Your information is hogwash.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The giant monster on the beach that you think is your Great One is nothing more than a giant octopus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wh-What are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huh? But that isn't just an octopus...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Shhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We're not going to stand here silent while you blather on about whatever you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I don't know about your Great One... But I won't let you take advantage of a pirate's love for adventure with fake maps!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Prepare yourselves. I'm going to teach you well and good what happens when you cross a real swashbuckler!</td>
