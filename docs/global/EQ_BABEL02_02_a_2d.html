<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>(From the moment I was born, I was alone. I grew up in this room without a single companion.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(I knew nothing of my parents. I knew nothing of myself.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(Three times a day, the sound of a key turning in the lock announced the arrival of the servant girl who brought my meals.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(The girl called me Zahar. I guessed it was my name.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(She always looked at me with eyes filled with scorn.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(Perhaps it is hard to imagine, but that was the time when I felt most keenly that I was hated by those around me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(Even though I didn't know why. No one ever told me. No one ever even spoke to me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Look, look! The flowers are blooming! How pretty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(Sometimes, I heard the voices of other children outside.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(It was forbidden to open the curtains, but I would open them just enough to peek outside.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(That room was always dark. My life was inextricably linked to that darkness.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(That was why I so desperately envied those who existed outside of it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(There were a great many books to read in that room. I read all of them to learn about the world.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(One day...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I am pleased to make your acquaintance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>My name is Letitia. I shall be your caregiver from today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(She looked right at me. She even spoke to me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hello, Zahar. I am only a little older than you, I hear. I could be your sister. Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sis...ter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. I also heard that you have been on your own all this time. It must have been very lonely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>From today, I shall be your sister. We shall be less lonely together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I have not been lonely. I have no need of a family. After all, I never had one before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I see. Even here, there is no place for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ah, it is nothing for you to concern yourself with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This is just the same as everywhere else I have been.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Why are you looking for a place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What? You... I see. I am a dark elf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Dark elf...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes. I suppose nobody ever told you... You really were all alone all this time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Y-you... Would you tell me? Can you tell me who I am? Who my parents are?! And...what is a half-elf?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It might not be what you want to hear. It may even be painful to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes. I want to know. I have to know! Tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Okay. I will. Let me start from the beginning...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(Letitia is the one who taught me everything...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(I was the unwanted spawn of a high-elf princess and a human.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(My father was executed when my existence came to light. My mother died soon after I was born.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(My family was, apparently, highly regarded among even the highest of high-elves. Knowledge of my existence would have been a stain on their reputation.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Dark elves like me are also despised by the high-elves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Once upon a time, one of my ancestors slayed their friend in cold blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The ill-gotten dark power they received for slaying a high-elf caused their Alchemia to transform them into a fallen being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We carry the blood of those traitors in ourselves. That is why the pure-blooded high-elves disdain us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Why did your ancestor kill their own friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I do not know. It happened too long before either of us were born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Letitia... Why are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>This family... They bought me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Bought you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I am a slave. The dark elves challenged the high-elves, and lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I am, essentially...a prize of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That is why I am here. It is my fate to come here, to be with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Slave...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(I had learned of slaves before, in books.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(So I understood that the two of us were the same. We were both people with no home left to us.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Letitia... Would you stay here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Oh. If...it is all right...but you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I want to learn more from you. So...please. Stay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Thank you, Zahar. I will stay with you as long as you want me to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(We were inseparable after that.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(When she wasn't with me, I stayed in the room, alone again.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>(I learned so much from her about the world; things that were not in my books.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(Things...I would have never known if I had not met her.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Look, look! I found a seed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Wow! It's so round and cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Zahar, it's time to eat. Oh... What are you looking at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>There are children outside. If I strain my eyes, I think I can see a huge tower in the distance, as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Zahar... Do you want to go outside?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>No. It's better in here, with you. I mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>It is too bright outside. It's...uncomfortable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>"Throw off the chains the glitterati have laid upon thou and rise to be the King of Darkness."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What...? What is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>An old saying of the dark elves. "For whom does the King of Darkness rise? For whom does the King of Darkness fight?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>The King of Darkness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The dark elves have always been the target of abuse from other elves, especially high-elves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>For us, this is a prophecy of hope; one that promises that a hero will rise up to save us from our suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I would do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>If someone ever tried to hurt you... I would rise up and become the King of Darkness to save you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Zahar... Thank you. That's a promise, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Yes. I promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Well, in that case... I had better teach you some alchemy so that you can keep your promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>But it has to be our little secret, okay? It is forbidden for those outside the Holy Guard to use alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>However...if you truly wish to become the King of Darkness, you will need alchemy. I believe that you can do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I will do it. If it will help me protect you, I will do anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Heheh. Thank you, Zahar. Then, here is a present to seal our promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>A necklace...? Made of wood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>It's a special handmade necklace, just for you. Take good care of it, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Okay... Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>(One day...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>(Letitia was late bringing my food. I was hungry...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>My liege... Please, no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>(Letitia...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>You pathetic, disgusting dark elf! You've gotten dirt on my clothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I-I didn't do it, sir... You crashed into me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Listen to you. Are you talking back to me, dark elf?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Tsk... Well, you can pay me back...with your Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>(What is happening? I can see a little through the keyhole...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Get on your knees, dark elf. I'll take it myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Ngh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>(Letitia!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I said to get on your knees. What are you, deaf?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Tch, dark elves are all the same. Dumb as cattle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Good. Then get on your knees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>(Letitia!!!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Stop! Stop!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Wh-What is...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Z-Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Leave...her...alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>The half-elf? How dare you leave that room, you festering half-breed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I will tell my father! You, who killed my wife... You will die, just as your father did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Nngh?! Urg... H...elp...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Grr... Graaahhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>(I don't remember anything after that.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>(Some elf elder I'd never seen before showed up and ordered us to leave.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>(My prison and my paradise...I lost them both in one fell swoop.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>(Reborn, and cast out into the world, I finally got to see what lay behind those four walls.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>So? What do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>It's...big.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Haha! It gets bigger than this! The towns are bigger, the mountains, the oceans, the forests...and the tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Tower...? The Tower of Babel? That we could see in the distance from the house?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Yes! Do you want to go see it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Hm... I think I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Okay! It's a little far, though. I don't know if we'll be able to make it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Come on, let's go! The two of us can go anywhere we want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>That's true. You're so strong, Zahar. It was amazing to see you in action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>I didn't know I had that in me... I just completely lost it when I saw you being treated like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Actually, I've been feeling off since I killed that elf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>It's probably because you've become a dark elf, like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>When an elf kills another, the Alchemia in the blood that is spilled transforms them into a dark elf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I'm...a dark elf? Oh... Oh! That makes me...happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Wh-what? Why? Dark elves are despised by all of elven society!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>What does that matter to me? But that I could become someone a little more like you... That's an honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Zahar... You really have become my defender. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Of course I did! I promised you, didn't I? I will become the King of Darkness to protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Yes, you did. You... Well. Yes. I believed you then, and I believe you now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>My King of Darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>(Ever since then, we have travelled all over the world.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>(The world is truly as great and wide as she said. Filled with struggle and cruelty...but also kindness and beauty.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>(I had grown to hate it when all I could see was a tiny sliver of what I couldn't have, but I fell in love with the world that I could move through freely.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>(We battled goblins and the occasional human on our journeys. Our coming of age was filled with danger and adventure.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>(Hundreds, thousands of days later...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Hey, did you hear? A forest in the west of Wratharis has completely withered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Oh yeah, I heard that. I even heard that it's become an actual desert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>No way! Isn't that where the elves lived?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>What?! That stuck-up lot? I didn't know they lived outside the dominion of the Holy Order...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Yeah. Well, they're probably dead now, if that forest has fallen to desertification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Still, it's crazy how all these forests and towns are just dying out like this, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>The world's totally gone curdled... There're goblins and ferals everywhere, fights breaking out all over...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>What's on your mind, Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Nothing. We should head out soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, we've been travelling all this time and we haven't made it to the Tower of Babel yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Hmm, you're right. Well, it's not really easy to get to it with the Holy Guard patrolling the surroundings, and the prohibition on alchemy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>But we still have time. We'll get to it one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>One day... You're right. I wonder... I wonder if the elves in that forest really are gone. Those high-elves who imprisoned us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Huh. Well... They were the kind who were quite stuck in their ways. I suspect they died along with that forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>What? Do you mourn their loss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Hmph. Of course not. I feel nothing. Really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>I am the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>I'm more concerned with the future than the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>The future?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Yes. We elves live for a long time... I'm starting to wonder how to fill that time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>It's been on my mind for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>This world is a bright and beautiful place, but...war and suffering...never seem to end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>In fact, it only ever seems to get worse...and worse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>On top of that, the forests are dying and turning to desert. I've been thinking that this world needs to change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>It seems to me like the only ones who are able to do something about it...are us elves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>I've gotten much stronger compared to when I was young. I've seen and experienced much, as well. I feel like...this is something I must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Once I started thinking about it, I just couldn't stop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>I see... Well, wherever you decide to go, whatever you decide to do... I will follow you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Thank you, Letitia. Let us work together and do what we can to change this flawed world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>What...? What was that? Did you hear that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Someone is screaming. It's coming...from that village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Hyaahhhh! Graaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>G-goblin! S-someone! Please, save us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Cleric, where's the Holy Guard?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>I-I'm not... I'm just—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Cleric?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>N-No... It's nothing! Everyone, run! Run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>That village is under attack! Letitia, let's go save them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Yes, I'm right behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>With this many goblins, we have no choice but to use alchemy...</td>
</tr>
