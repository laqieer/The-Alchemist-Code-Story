<td>Sigh...</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I cannot believe I made Ankh upset. He's usually so unflappable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I wanted to make him smile, but I infuriated him instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(I did my best to make people to smile by helping them, just like she'd done for me...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(Perhaps I'm simply not good at it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I love this festival. Everybody working together to set it up and making each other smile so happily...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Festivals make people happy. That's why I love festivals, and I will do anything to protect them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I see... Then I wish to be like you, Klima, someone who can protect the smiles of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I wish to be strong and help others as you do. I want to be strong enough to protect people's happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I think that's very good. I give you an A+ for ambition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Reimei! You came looking for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I mean, it's hard to not worry when someone runs out like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ah, r-right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I've only caused problem after problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm so horrible. Not at all worthy of an A+.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>An A+, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Plumeria, why put so much effort into this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I asked you earlier, didn't I? About why you were so interested in helping out with the White Day party? And you were about to say something. What was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Right. But why insist on White Day for that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well, that's because White Day is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What is it that motivates you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I don't want anybody to regret the way I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Regret?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>A long time ago, I was told that there was a festival in a particular village. I wanted to see it for myself very much, but Mother and Father forbade me, saying that it could be dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Back then, I was often a target for kidnapping because people thought they could ransom me for money, so I understand their apprehension.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Kidnapping? Oh, right. You were the only child of a noble family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But I just couldn't help myself. I snuck away to the festival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It was so fascinating and fun, but just as my parents feared, I ended up surrounded by scary people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Heheheh, you out here alone? Pretty careless for a rich kid. You should be worth a damn good bit of ransom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>L-let me go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(If I scream, I will ruin the festival for everybody. How can I do that when this is the result of my own careless and selfish actions?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(I cannot allow that! But then...what can I do?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh? Is it raining?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Waaaaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ouch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>A-are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Absolutely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>More importantly, are you? Can you still smile?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I love this festival. So I want everyone to enjoy it as well. You ought to be smiling too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, I'm fine. I can still smile and have fun. I love this festival too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I see. That's good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I, um! Th-thank y—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Klima, you really outdid yourself this year! It's going to be hard beating something like making it rain on a harvest festival the next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The lightning was a bit much, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>If you like, Klima, we can prepare that tea for you to thank you for livening up the festival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ooh! Yay! I love this tea. The citrus notes are especially lovely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Would you like some too, young lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>May I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Of course! Only because it's a festival day, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>And so you regret not being able to show your gratitude to that person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>The next time I visited that village, she was not there. I was never able to see her again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>To show gratitude to those who have been kind to you... White Day is really a wonderful event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>No one has to live with regret as long as they do not miss their chance to express their gratitude like I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Is that what White Day is about? I thought White Day was just about giving people sweets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But along with the sweets, people present their words of gratitude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Huh, I see. So it's a day we gift sweets specifically those who you feel grateful towards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yes. So, when I heard about the party to celebrate White Day, I knew I had to take part in it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I wanted the party to be one in which those expressing their gratitude and those receiving it would be smiling and happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I did not want anyone else to miss their chance to express their gratitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I see. I think I understand where you're coming from, and why you've been acting so anxious about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Reimei...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>However, I think it's important to start with what you know you can handle in order to accomplish what you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Slow and steady wins the race, you know. You can't help anyone by just rushing around with no real plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>What I know I can handle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Filling the party venue with a floral aroma was a great idea, and I think Ankh will come around to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>(Aroma... Bergamot... Citrus notes... Could it be?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You're right. I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I'm glad you do. So for now, let's go follow whatever instructions Ankh h—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I'm going to go find the legendary tea, Parfaire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Uh, what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Wait, what? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I've got a plan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>No... Listen, when I said that, I meant—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>There is no need to worry. I'm sure I can... No, I must accomplish this quest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>When I find this legendary tea, I'm sure Ankh will smile!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Parfaire tea, eh? We do indeed make that here in this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I knew it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>It's just that we haven't any available right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>That tea has a really short expiration date. It has to be brewed almost immediately after being roasted. One day at the most.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>The roasting process is unique as well. So it almost never leaves this village, and we only have it on special occasions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I see. Um... What if... What if I bring fresh leaves here? Could you roast them for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I don't mind, but... Are you going alone, miss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I can tell you where to find some, but monsters roam those parts. It's dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Do not worry! I am more capable than I appear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ah, another day of successfully bringing couples together. I feel so accomplished!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Now, I wonder how Plumeria is doing? I hope everything went well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Wait, Plumeria?! What are you doing here alone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Wait a minute... Alone?! Why are you alone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Moa! I am here searching for the legendary tea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Huh? You're... What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>C-could it be, perhaps, a gift of love?! P-Plumeria, wait for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Surely it must be somewhere around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>To come all this way for a gift... You are more proactive than I thought, Plumeria.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Huh? Uh, yes! I am doing my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Uh oh! An obstacle to your love has appeared! Well, you know what they say: the course of true love never did run smoothly!</td>
</tr>
