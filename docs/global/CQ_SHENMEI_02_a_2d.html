<td>It's been quite a long time since we entered the forest. Is the treasure still further ahead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>H-hmm...I think so. I have the treasure map, so don't worry. Just follow me, Vanekis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But...isn't this the third time we've passed this way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>N-no, that's not possible! I mean, this way is north and that way is south...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Shenmei, the map...aren't you looking at it upside down? Also, north and south are in the opposite direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey, Shenmei, how about I lead the way instead? I want to check if the information I purchased is correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I-in that case, be my guest! ...Sorry, Vanekis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. But, maybe it would've been better if you brought your crewmates along with us as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No! If I did that, it'll just be the same as always!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>My crewmates are always nagging me. They tell me not to push myself too hard and that, as their captain, it's dangerous for me to go off on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's why I want to find this treasure on my own and show off my abilities!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I see. But I think I kind of understand how your crewmates feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm pretty sure that they care about you so much that it worries them sick that something might happen to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Bu-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Be-besides, you've hired me to help you find the treasure anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hmph... Ne-never mind that! Today, we're going to find the treasure on our own! Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Fine, fine. Let's.</td>
