<td>Haahhh!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Aghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Whoa! Nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ngh! What the hell?! She's no ordinary card dealer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You guys didn't do your homework. That's some shoddy thief-work you're doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're lecturing them? So you think you can do better?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, first of all, I wouldn't rob this place while you were still here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Just who do you think youâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>W-wait... You're Chat Noir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Did you just figure this out? You're not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Shut up! Why are you getting in our way?! What, did you have your eyes on this place first or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Not really imaginative either, I see. No wonder you're so bad at being a thief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Just what are you trying to say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm saying don't even think about sorting me in with you lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You think you're artistic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I guess I could let Justin take care of this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>He's probably feeling down about letting me slip away again. This should cheer him up a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>He could use a little bump of self-esteem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I would think he'd be even more upset with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Can I ask you a question? Earlier you mentioned being artistic. What did you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmm, well... I don't go around stealing any old thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What I'm hunting is the truth. I only steal antiques and works of art closely related to the history of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm not interested in stealing things for the sake of monetary value. That's the art of my thievery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The history of Babel? What is it about the past that you're so interested in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>There's no way to change the result of a cast die. What's the point?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The present is spawned from the past, yet the truth about the past is locked securely away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>For example, undiscovered ruins may contain unexplained powers. Powers much like your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Doesn't that make you curious? That's why I want to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>W-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You think it's a stupid dream, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>A little. It's a very extraordinary, preposterous dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(But I suppose it's this dream that makes Chat Noir shine so brightly.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(He's having the time of his life, honestly going after what he wants...much like a child would.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(I wonder if I'll ever have a dream of my own.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(Even if I don't, maybe if I stick with him...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Aisha, would you like to be my accomplice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You didn't laugh at my dream. In fact, you seemed to enjoy hearing about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Your eyes were like that of a wishful damsel. I think we have a lot in common. You'd make a great partner for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wh-what?! D-d-damsel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I guess your special sight doesn't work on yourself? Your eyes were glittering the same way they did when you were talking about that die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Besides, when I uncover the truth of the ancients, we might find out more about that power of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Well, I won't force you to do anything you don't want to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hold on a second! Let me do just this one thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(Ten pips total... "Now is the time." Hehe! That's a good omen if I ever saw one.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Chat Noir, I'd be happy to see that dream through with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wonderful! I think we're going to get along just fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>So, now that we are partners... Will you do me one favor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>A favor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I want you to steal the oldest set of dice in the world for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What? No. That sounds stupid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Stupid?! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That has nothing to do with the ancient history of Babel! It goes against my modus operandi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Are you serious?! Cheapskate!</td>
</tr>
