<td>Looks like we got away.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>That was so sc—ahem. I wasn't scared at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Really? It was very scary for me. It's okay if you thought so, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I didn't! I wasn't scared at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hahaha. You're a tough one, Jayme. Still, I'm surprised my blade couldn't even make a scratch on that thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Perhaps that was the keeper of this shrine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>A keeper? Did you know this place had something like that, Macherie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I wasn't given many details about any of this, but there are legends that tell of a guardian of some sort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I had assumed that there would be some form of trial, one that happened to be called the keeper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Legend says that only those with the power to overcome the keeper will be able to reach the jewel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You mean to tell me that the people of the shrine knew there would be a trial like this, and they still sent you here alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I-I doubt even the Shrine Monarch knew exactly what would be here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Even so, this isn't something they should have tasked you to handle alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's for the good of the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Macherie...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(Not only Jayme, but Macherie, too, is dedicated to doing what she must for the people she loves.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(They fight, protect, and care for one another in this village.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What's good for the village is good for Jayme.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Sis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>For that, I'm willing to sacrifice myself if—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Macherie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't you dare finish that sentence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We don't want to hear you say that. Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Setsuna?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Setsuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(What she was about to say... A life lost will only ruin another life.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(Because those who lose the people they love can become...can become...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Those with people whom they want to protect should never say such a thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Setsuna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes...you're right. I'm sorry, Setsuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Setsuna... If you'd like—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Don't ask me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You're kind, Macherie. But please, don't ask me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(If she does, I'll probably be unable to resist.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(If I allow myself to be dependent on them, I'll never be able to stand on my own again.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I decided that I would never again have something I needed to protect.</td>
