<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>So this...is Castle Aquila Rubrum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. It is the symbolic heart of Wadatsumi's royalty, built by your ancestors, the House of Rising Ashes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It also formerly served as the Blade Fox headquarters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's still hard to believe I'm descended from Wadatsumi royalty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Head to the home of your people, Logi. Your destiny awaits you there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(I was told that many souls once dwelled here.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(Then there was a great Malice that brought ruin to them.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(This demon... This Malice wrought untold havoc upon Wadatsumi.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(So much of what could have been important to me was robbed away before I even had a chance to know of its existence.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(And then...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Logi? Is something the matter? You seem lost in thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ah, sorry. It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Can't blame you if you're feeling a little dumbstruck. It's not every day you find out you're royalty in a foreign land and get brought to your family's old castle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Is everything all right, then, Logi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Absolutely. So, what do you need me to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well, first and foremost...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I knew you'd be back, Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Jubei...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I seem to have been right to take action when I did. I'm glad to see you safe and sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Jubei?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Have you already heard of what happened to Lady Celis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I...have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Anything I say now would only come across as a hollow excuse for not being able to save her. So I've resolved simply to continue cutting down demons. That, I believe, is my road to atonement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So? Did you get it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Here. The demon's horn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This is...Tamba's?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>With this horn, we can now finally restore Sumeragi and Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...! Logi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's really you! I can hardly believe it. You've grown so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You know me? Who might you be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm sorry, I have yet to introduce myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I was once a member of the Scarlet Flame Guard, and fought alongside your mother, Lady Celis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Since then, I have been once ousted from the Blade Fox, but have been welcomed back into their ranks as captain. My name is Jubei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Really?! The Scarlet Flame Guard?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I must apologize for having to drag you into this, Lord Logi. This is all because I failed to handle it myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But if you could lend a hand, we would certainly be grateful. Though, to be honest, Lady Celis too had hoped it would never come to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>There is one other thing to note as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Lady Celis! Hang in there! Let me see if I can patch you up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It's no use. I'm...not going to make it. But please, if you would... Take this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>A...dagger?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I've imbued it with my will. Wherever it goes...so too shall my soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>My children will surely understand. So...please...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If you could also tell everyone...to please...take care of Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Lady Celis! Don't strain yourself any further! Just hang on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Jubei, I want you to...take care of everyone, and...I wanted to...thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Lady Celis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Tell Amane...to try not to be...so picky at the dinner table. And...tell Logi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...to do his best...to protect...the peace...for everyone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Lady Celis? Lady Celis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I have that dagger now. It's...painful to think of, but it's an important memento of her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I see. I hope you'll take good care of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I suppose it may have been meant for me, but I...don't think the time is right for me to have it. I don't entirely understand the significance of it yet, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I understand. And I'm happy to keep it safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Logi, I want you to know that I will continue to cut down demons in Lady Celis' honor. I swear it upon her name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>May I ask you to lend your aid?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I will do my utmost. But there is something I'm lacking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Oh? And what might that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I've heard all there is to be heard. I'm now deeply involved with what is happening in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I want to protect the way of life here. The problem is, I don't know what that way of life is just yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I want to carry on the will of those who've been lost, but I haven't come to know what the people here have willed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What did my father go through when raising me? What did my mother feel when she left me behind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I want to know what was in their hearts. I feel like it's my responsibility to know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Logi...</td>
</tr>
