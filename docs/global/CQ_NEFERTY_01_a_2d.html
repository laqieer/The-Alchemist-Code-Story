<td>This place is just like it was... Just as we are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The court is still full of infighting and power struggles, unable to solve even the newest problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The fact that desert people are being kidnapped and sold as slaves is a problem that we, as desert people, should not overlook.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I want to unite the people of the desert to protect this desert, you said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That dream you had is still a dream. You said you would leave it to me. I'm sorry...Hawk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I didn't think you'd come all the way out here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>My my, I could say the same about you, Ryle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is the place Hawk passed away. It would be unlike you to forget that, wouldn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Why are you here, Ryle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I had something to do nearby, that's all. What about you? What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I've been reminiscing about him a little bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Protecting the desert, huh? Do you regret what happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Regret? Hm. I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Sometimes it doesn't feel like it's really something that's in the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>How curious. That almost exactly describes how I feel about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wow. You haven't changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hawk's ideals were too big for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>His dreams may not have been wrong, but people don't operate on emotion alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>People only act when there's profit. There has to be a common goal shared by everyone in order for them to work together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We couldn't find it, so we failed to become a unified country...as you well know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I remember well indeed, because I had quite the struggle with the conservatives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ultimately, we tried to keep the power structure the same, so we ended up with a lot of trouble with the conservatives and reformists within the aristocracy, not to mention the factional strife within each faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You always seem to make enemies wherever you go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What a terrible thing to say. I'm only doing what I feel I should be doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There will always be those who are disappointed with what I choose to do. I can't help that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The court never changes. Always a pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hehe. You might be surprised to hear it, but it can be surprisingly fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's a place that requires a lot of improvisation and effort in order to get where you want to be, where things rarely go your way and you often have to think on your feet just to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That is why Hawk was determined to leave the court.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>In the time he had left to live, he wanted to do whatever he could to make his dream a reality, no matter what it took. Even if there wasn't much he really could do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>And as a result, he lost his life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That man's will was not allowed to reach its full potential. In the end, the pros and cons of that choice remain unknown...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The whole "we're all in this together" thing was always just a pie-in-the-sky ideal. It didn't fit the reality, so no one wanted to put the effort into it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>However, it doesn't mean his desperate wish to try and bring change to this place didn't mean anything. The truth of it still exists, even now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That desire to change things... I'm sure it wasn't a bad thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Things won't change unless there's someone willing to bring change. It's easiest to maintain the status quo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The status quo will eventually reach its limit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yes. And when that happens...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...this land will perish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I'm so...disappointed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You! You must be Ryle of the Desert Wings!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I don't know why you're here, but you're gonna pay for what you did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You guys... Oh, I knew it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, acquaintances of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Of course not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>They seem to recognize you, though. More importantly, now that they've pointed weapons at us, we have no choice but to deal with them.</td>
