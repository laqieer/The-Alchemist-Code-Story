<td>Hello there, Sir Dragon! Welcome to our town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Is this your first time here? Please, have a look at our wares! I can offer you a good deal, if anything catches your eye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Such...an aggressive welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I thought humans feared and revered us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But no one here seems to fear me in the slightest. And this isn't exactly the kind of reverence I had in mind, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>How am I meant to focus on my search for Lil when every other person in town is calling out to me? Hmph. I suppose there's only one proper answer to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Good. Up here, I can see the whole landscape in a single glance. Now, where could you be, Lil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That was a close one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What do you think you're doing, Claybelle?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>A little sparring after a meal to help with digestion. Nothing more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I did have quite the illuminating dinner conversation, though. Heh... Who knew you could ever be somebody's papa?! Hahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You found Lil?! Where is she?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>She's safe and sound in my mansion at the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But I can't let you see her just yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What? You dare side with Ophioneus?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh, I have absolutely no intention of doing that, believe me. I'm just not yet certain I can fully trust you, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Schmeier wishes for Ouroboros to understand humanity. Lil is the culmination of that wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This makes Schmeier a kindred soul of mine. I would have no objections to lending her my aid, as one who lives among and believes in the potential of humanity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Then why wouldn't youâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That sense of camaraderie does not extend to you just yet, Zafeiris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Why were you with Schmeier to begin with?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Why would a man known only to speak of the future through the lens of past sins and glories be...coupled...with one of our foremost researchers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>In all honesty, I don't know how to answer that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>All I can say is, I was entrusted with Lil's care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That tells me nothing. Perhaps I need to coerce the truth out of you with a little more force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Grrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Creation of beasts from magil?! Is this one of the fruits of your research?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Quite a trick, no? It's hard to make them do finer tasks, but when I'm short-handed, they can be awfully useful nonetheless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Particularly when I need a physical barrier to rely on. I know what you're capable of, Guardian Dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>As such, I have no intention of facing you without a few advantages to help even the scales a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I have no reason to fight you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Tough. I have reason enough for the both of us. Schmeier is a friend of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>And she entrusted her dearest wishes to you. So I need to be certain that you've got both the strength and the will to adequately see them through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You're serious, then? All right! If you insist!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Let me forewarn you, though: In this form, I cannot hold my strength back. You'll be lucky to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Heh. Big words from a big blockhead!</td>
</tr>
