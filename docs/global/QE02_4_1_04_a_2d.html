<td>Your way of thinking isn't wrong! Even if history will not accept it...we must find a way to live together as humans!</td>

<td>After all, my master...that is, the Elester family were able to prove that it was possible within this country!</td>

<td>You speak of ideals. Seeing my country destroyed before my eyes, I realized what I believed in was nothing more than naive ideals.</td>

<td>That's not true!</td>

<td>The young lady told me the same thing. She said that, if we don't give up, we can find a way to come together.</td>

<td>I once pursued those naive ideals, but came to deny them after experiencing sorrow and tragedy...</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's taken a little too long, but that young lady finally hammered them back into my head. I'm ashamed to admit that I couldn't give her anything in return.</td>

<td>So you're discarding the lessons you learned through your tragedy because of the words of a mere girl?</td>

<td>Alvarez...I can't afford to hand you this Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I see. It's quite unfortunate that we couldn't reach an understanding.</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Furthermore...I'd appreciate if you saved those words until after you've defeated my most prized droids.</td>

<td>Looks like they've been manufactured to be incredibly tough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Fine. I'll fight them for as long as it takes to make my naive ideal a reality!</td>
