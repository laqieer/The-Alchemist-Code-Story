<td>The Liberation Army left their stronghold?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>They are headed straight towards this arboreal altar. What will you do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hmph, my forces are now innumerable. The Liberation Army is of no concern, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>He would not send the soldiers to their deaths. Kamui...what are you planning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What?! You want to procure a shipment of lime? At a time like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We need as much as possible. Do you happen to have any leads as to where we might find some?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well, we use it for farming, building, and even art...so there is a large stock of it in the warehouse, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What do you need lime for? You planning on making incendiary grenades?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hey! The evac ship is leaving! Are you coming or not?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Aw, snap! Fine, fine! Take what you need! I'll be charging you later for what's used, got it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Not a problem! We owe you one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Tina! How's your end going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah, I found a merchant willing to give some away. It was apparently just slowing them down as they're trying to get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Perceptive merchants are foreseeing a major loss if they linger in this country too long. They're fleeing like there's no tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>With the royal capital in the state it's in, it can't be helped. This is good for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Logi, I'll need you to get the Blue Tongues to carry as much lime as they can out of this warehouse and deliver it to the Liberation Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But...this is a lot more than I expected. You're saying that heat treating this will make quicklime?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It might take some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It will. We'll be needing temperatures well over a thousand degrees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Even searching for a facility that can treat this much lime would cost us precious time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Then what are we to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We're going to have to resort to desperate measures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?! No, wait, wait, wait, wait!</td>
