<td>...Bang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Agh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hey now. This isn't it for you...is it? I'm even holding back to keep my wounds from opening up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ngh! A-as if! I won't lose to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh yeah... That reminds me. You're supposed to be the embodiment of justice in this world, aren't you, little miss "Lord Commander"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Armageddon Sky!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hey, I'm in the middle of speaking to your little friend here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What?! Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You'll be last. I'm going to take my time with you, so just wait your turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Like I was saying. Lord Commander, if you claim to be the embodiment of justice, then I cannot forgive you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You will pay with your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ugh... Pay? For...what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lost Blue... For not conforming to the continent's definition of justice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Simply for that reason, the people of Lost Blue are ostracized by the rest of the world, even to this day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If you represent the justice of this continent, then logically...you are the one who should be held responsible, am I not right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ngh! B-by what right...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If people are living persecuted lives for being different...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Then you may be right. I accept responsibility for my part in a system that allows that to happen. I apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Kanon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But still...it does not excuse your hurting others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The slaughter you have left in your wake will never be justified!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's just a matter of opinion. Life itself has no value. Only the strength of one's willpower can determine a life's value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Willpower?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's right. Just look at the beasts in the wild. Only the ones that are determined to survive will live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That is how the world of humans should be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Are you saying we should live in a world where the weak are culled out of society?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Exactly. Unfortunately, this world preaches that life itself is more precious than anything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Such naive teachings keep the weak living among us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The result is this pathetic world, in which any fool can breathe the same air as we do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Those fools outnumber the strong-willed while those who do possess a strong will are seen as outcasts and find themselves rejected from society.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Those with a strong will to live?! Quit romanticizing yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Lost Blue is just a collection of criminals and scoundrels!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Fool. They are only treated as criminals for having a different set of values.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>From our perspective, the true criminals are the people of the rest of this world, who live lives of complacency.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If you, the Lord Commander, are justice incarnate, then you are leading this world down the path of sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's why you must pay with your life. Your death will show the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It will show them that what we are attempting to accomplish is no mere fantasy! This world can change for the better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You are free to dream whatever you like, but it will never become a reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>And why is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Because I will stand in your way! It is my duty to protect this world! As long as I live, I will not let you do as you wish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That is the answer I wanted. It means that killing you is a definitive step toward realizing our goal. Simple, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'd like to see you try! Alchemia Nova!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>He deflected it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Don't you get it? You cannot defeat me. This is a simple fact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Your reality is going to be a thing of the past!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Primordial Big Bang!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Aaaghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Tch! I hate having to exert myself. I guess I could have used a lot less energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I-if I...survive this blast...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>If my blade can reach you...we can still win!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Y-you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It is my responsibility to defend the peace of this world! I cannot afford to lose against you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Eternal Glow!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Nngh—graaaaaahh...! Heh. Just kidding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I-I can't move?! This is...a magic circle?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Did you not learn anything from watching Othima? This is one of his signature moves, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>M-magic?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Ex Atmosphere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I...c-cannot lose...to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>She didn't rise to Lord Commander for nothing. She was tougher than I expected... Now it's your turn to die. I do hope you will forgive me for keeping you waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You think your magic can take me out?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I know it can't. Magic is your forte. I'll just have to beat you to death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Nngh! I...can't move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Die regretting your choice to get in our way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>That's a magic circle, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Captain Dilga taught me that the best way to release a person from the hold of a magic circle is to punch them out of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Who...are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Me? I'm Bud Crowley! A knight of the Blue Flame Guard from Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>The Blue Flame Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You're Lord Commander Kanon, correct? There's nothing to fear! More knights from Envylia are on the way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Chloe and Captain Vettel of the Scarlet Flame Guard should be arriving soon as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>R-run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>That man is out of your league! You're no match for him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What are you saying? You want me to turn my back on the enemy and run? These are not words I'd expect from the Holy—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>This is not a playground, kid. Stay out of my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Agh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>H-how could you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I simply got rid of a fool who could not even grasp the overwhelming difference in our power. Prepare yourself, redhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Nngh! Y-you're the fool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>D-difference in power? Like I care! Power isn't what decides the victor of a battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>The one with greater willpower wins in the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Huh, interesting. I have to agree with you on that point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>N-no! Don't provoke him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I'm d-disappointed in you all! Are you really Captain Monzein's comrades?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>If you have conviction, there's no need to run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>If you can't put your life on the line now, then when can you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I'm glad to see a youth that understands. I'm impressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>However, you suffer from a severe lack of experience. You still don't know that willpower alone cannot bend the light to your will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>You need to have the power to realize your desires if you want to really accomplish anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Then show me what power you've got! I'll show you that I can take it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>The words of those without the strength to carry out their will are nothing more than hot air. It's time you faced the truth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Wh-whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Get back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Isn't it your duty to protect Envylia?! Don't waste your life here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>You're going to sacrifice yourself for some boy you've just met? Fine. I'll kill you first, redhead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>You have caused me enough trouble. Atone for your sins with your soul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Urk! Aaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>H-huzzaaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Ugh... Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Reimei?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>You're tougher than I thought. How are you still alive? Do you still not understand how pointless it is to challenge me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>P-pointless? Urgh...! Don't be so...sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Urk! Y-you... When...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>How...disappointing. I w-wanted to...see where your path would...take you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>My path? What are you talking about? You think a wound like this is going to change anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>D-don't be stupid. I'm an assassin. I would never...misjudge...my t-target's strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>And...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I can admit you're stronger than me. B-but...you underestimate...what others are...capable of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>H-hey, let go! Restraining me won't get you anywhere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>You're making no sense. I don't have time to play games with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>L-let me take back what I said. I already know...to wh-what end...your path will lead you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I-I'm saying it's easy to see...what fate has in store for you. R-right, Kudan...stein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Hmph. Couldn't have said it better myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>You...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>C-Captain Kudan?!</td>
