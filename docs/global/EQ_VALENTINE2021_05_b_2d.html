<td>Ugh! These wretched beasts! There's no end to them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We have to do something to neutralize the scent of the Purple Cacao...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I think I may have just the thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's a new medicine I concocted just now in the carriage, and this seems like the perfect opportunity for a trial run. Here goes nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Aroog?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What? What's happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I've been experimenting with different means of counteracting the Rainbow Cacao's effects since that girl first ran into us, and I'd say that was a rather successful proof of concept, wouldn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's incredible, Lizzy! Your medicine completely canceled out the effects of the Purple Cacao!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So, now that the ace up your sleeve has been removed from play, are you finally ready to give up, you miscreant?! Hand over the Rainbow Cacao!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm afraid can't do that. If I do, the other court mages will know what I've done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Um, I'm pretty sure they're going to find out, regardless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But I should be able to get away with it, as long as there's no evidence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This Rainbow Cacao is as good as worthless if that medicine has neutralized all its effects. So I might as well just throw it all away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>She actually dumped it! What a recklessly catastrophic thing to do—particularly for a witch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Don't worry; I've got this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Caris?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Caris, wait! That's a cliff edge over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Don't worry about it! There's no road my bike can't handle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And...gotcha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>She actually caught the bag?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Caris! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Of course I am! And so's my bike, and the cacao. Everything is under control!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It looks like I can even head back by way of the cliffside roads down here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Thank goodness you're safe, but why would you even attempt something so absolutely foolish?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I just wanted to help! Simple as that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There's this one passionate merchant I know who really wants to make sure everyone can always get the things they need, you see. And she needed a hand, so I gave it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Caris...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That shouldn't have even been possible! This is absurd...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So, yeah! We took down the operations at the black market and captured the head of the whole scheme! Not bad, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Indeed, you've done a remarkable thing here. We're deeply indebted to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's hard to fathom the lengths some people will go to for Rainbow Cacao. We really must tighten our grip on it even further, so no such incidences ever occur again. Do you not agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I think we may have to, since so many have been hurt by it—be it directly or in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If I may interject, I really don't think making the distribution laws stricter will actually help solve anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And what makes you say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, there are a lot of people who need Rainbow Cacao for one reason or another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>They need it so badly, in fact, that they're willing to pay any price and risk buying it from illicit sellers. No matter the restrictions, this will continue happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It very well may, but the fact remains that Rainbow Cacao is extremely dangerous—Purple Cacao in particular, poisonous as it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, you don't have to worry about that anymore. I made some medicine that can fully neutralize the cacao's poison.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What? You've concocted an antidote?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If handled properly, Rainbow Cacao can be used to make all kinds of cosmetic goods, remedies, and topical creams. For example... Well, if you'll indulge me, may I see your hand? Here. This is good for the skin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh, my! It doesn't feel greasy at all, and my skin looks so smooth and supple now. I feel...calmer, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>W-wait, I want to try it, too! Can I have some on my hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Sure! The effects of Blue and Purple Cacao work together quite harmoniously, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I've discovered that mixing Blue and Green Cacao creates an effective painkiller, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I even took this rare opportunity to try mixing things like energy drinks through an infusion of pure Red Cacao!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I had no idea Rainbow Cacao had so many potential uses...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>This is nothing! Lizzy can make tons more cool stuff with it, given the chance. Right, Lizzy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Easily. Rainbow Cacao is largely uncharted territory at present, so the potential remains for a whole world of possible combinations!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>See? I'm sure there are lots of people who could benefit from the cacao's effects in lots of ways. It could improve so many lives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So I really want to see Rainbow Cacao made available to the general public, to ensure that those who need it can get their hands on it without having to put themselves at risk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>For what it's worth, I think it's a good idea too. Legalizing it would instantly see a drastic reduction in the crimes and incidences you've all had to deal with because of it, if nothing else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I mean, all this drama only started after you tightened your grip on it, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Well... I suppose having an antidote that can neutralize its poison would all but eliminate the number of severe illnesses we've been seeing of late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It would be easier to manage and regulate its sale, too, if it were legal in some capacity. And we wouldn't have to devote so many of our resources to tracking down the underground markets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Realistically, we can't overturn all the distribution laws around it just like that. Great care must be taken in the handling of such dangerous magical materials, particularly due to its strong effects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>However... I believe it is a process we should begin. You've made it clear to us that it's in everyone's best interests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Oh! So, you'll do it, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Once we figure out and stabilize a means of managing Rainbow Cacao, it should be possible to make it available for public use and consumption, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But in order to get things started, we will need to do more research on the antidote you created.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Of course! And if you can make something even more effective than what I came up with, I'd love to see the formula!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yay, we did it! And we couldn't have done it without your medicine, Lizzy. You're a real hero, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>When in the world did you even have time to make all of these things?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Margaret asked me to while we were en route to corner the witch. She suggested I try creating some common household products like cosmetics using the bits of chocolate left behind in the peddler's carriage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It was Margaret's idea?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Excuse you! You don't have to act so surprised, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>No, no, I believe I do. You actually asked Elizabeth to do something for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What happened to, "Oh, no, I could never trouble Lizzy with anything"? Asking her to make something that's not even medicine, no less! That's monumental. Earth-shattering, even!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Well, I guess when you put it that way, you're...not wrong. I really wouldn't ordinarily say anything that might bother Lizzy or cause her any trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I just wanted to see Rainbow Cacao in the hands of the people so badly, it kind of overrode that instinct!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Huh. So when all is said and done, you're still a merchant at heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>That she is. And besides, it was no trouble for me at all! I loved working with the cacao.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>(And I loved that Margaret felt comfortable enough asking me to. It was indeed the first time she ever has, I suppose!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I definitely want to try making more after the Rainbow Cacao is legalized, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I'll be counting on you for a good stock to work with, Margaret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>And I won't let you down! I'll gather up the highest quality Rainbow Cacao and deliver it right to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Hey, all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Word is you had quite the time dealing with the black market problem! Glad to see you're okay, though. We finished our job as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>And now that our contract is finished, we were thinking of making some Valentine's Day chocolate and exchanging it with one another. Would you care to join us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Ooh, sure! That sounds like a lot of fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I'll make some chocolates with Lizzy and bring them over later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Great! We'll see you then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Uhh, just for the record, you're not allowed to bring any chocolates filled with weird medicine, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Suzuka! That's mean! There's nothing "weird" about Lizzy's medicine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Wow. Not even going to deny the possibility that Elizabeth might fill her chocolates with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Of course not! And I wouldn't try to stop her if she did. I could never stand in the way of her dreams like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Hmm... You know, using Rainbow Cacao to make medicine is all well and good, but perhaps I'll spare some of it to try making chocolate instead, just this once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I have just the right amount with me, since they allowed me to keep some for medicinal research purposes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>And I should have a good recipe now for making chocolate with energy-boosting properties, so the opportunity is almost too good to pass up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Wow, that sounds awesome! Let's try making some right away. And while we're at it, let's fill some of them with medicine, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>That's a good idea. If we pad the recipe out with regular medicine, we'll be able to make a lot more chocolate overall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Uhh... Are you being serious right now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Oh, hey! There's another idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Since Caris helped us out so much today, let's give her the honor of being the first person to try our chocolates after we make them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>That sounds like a lovely gesture! First, we can make some with—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>H-hey, you know, I think I'm gonna go make chocolate with Suzuka and the others. Byee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Oh, she's gone. That's too bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Ah, well. That's okay. Now I can be the first one to eat your chocolate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Really? I won't give you any medicine-filled ones, then. I promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>So, Lizzy, what kind of chocolates are you thinking of making? All comers are welcome, as far as I'm concerned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I'll eat every last one, and I bet I'll be feeling super duper happy and energetic after I do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>You have been the only one for me.<br>Happy Valentine’s Day with <br>lots of love!</td>
</tr>
