<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>Indeed, you've done a remarkable thing here. We're deeply indebted to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>It's hard to fathom the lengths some people will go to for Rainbow Cacao. We really must tighten our grip on it even further, so no such incidences ever occur again. Do you not agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage B</td>
<td>I think we may have to, since so many have been hurt by it—be it directly or in.</td>

<td>And what makes you say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Well, there are a lot of people who need Rainbow Cacao for one reason or another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>They need it so badly, in fact, that they're willing to pay any price and risk buying it from illicit sellers. No matter the restrictions, this will continue happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage B</td>
<td>It very well may, but the fact remains that Rainbow Cacao is extremely dangerous—Purple Cacao in particular, poisonous as it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Oh, you don't have to worry about that anymore. I made some medicine that can fully neutralize the cacao's poison.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>What? You've concocted an antidote?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>If handled properly, Rainbow Cacao can be used to make all kinds of cosmetic goods, remedies, and topical creams. For example... Well, if you'll indulge me, may I see your hand? Here. This is good for the skin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>Oh, my! It doesn't feel greasy at all, and my skin looks so smooth and supple now. I feel...calmer, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage B</td>
<td>W-wait, I want to try it, too! Can I have some on my hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Sure! The effects of Blue and Purple Cacao work together quite harmoniously, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>I've discovered that mixing Blue and Green Cacao creates an effective painkiller, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>I even took this rare opportunity to try mixing things like energy drinks through an infusion of pure Red Cacao!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>I had no idea Rainbow Cacao had so many potential uses...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>This is nothing! Lizzy can make tons more cool stuff with it, given the chance. Right, Lizzy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Easily. Rainbow Cacao is largely uncharted territory at present, so the potential remains for a whole world of possible combinations!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>See? I'm sure there are lots of people who could benefit from the cacao's effects in lots of ways. It could improve so many lives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>So I really want to see Rainbow Cacao made available to the general public, to ensure that those who need it can get their hands on it without having to put themselves at risk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>For what it's worth, I think it's a good idea too. Legalizing it would instantly see a drastic reduction in the crimes and incidences you've all had to deal with because of it, if nothing else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>I mean, all this drama only started after you tightened your grip on it, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage B</td>
<td>Well... I suppose having an antidote that can neutralize its poison would all but eliminate the number of severe illnesses we've been seeing of late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage B</td>
<td>It would be easier to manage and regulate its sale, too, if it were legal in some capacity. And we wouldn't have to devote so many of our resources to tracking down the underground markets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>Realistically, we can't overturn all the distribution laws around it just like that. Great care must be taken in the handling of such dangerous magical materials, particularly due to its strong effects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>However... I believe it is a process we should begin. You've made it clear to us that it's in everyone's best interests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Oh! So, you'll do it, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>Once we figure out and stabilize a means of managing Rainbow Cacao, it should be possible to make it available for public use and consumption, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>But in order to get things started, we will need to do more research on the antidote you created.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Of course! And if you can make something even more effective than what I came up with, I'd love to see the formula!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Yay, we did it! And we couldn't have done it without your medicine, Lizzy. You're a real hero, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>When in the world did you even have time to make all of these things?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Margaret asked me to while we were en route to corner the witch. She suggested I try creating some common household products like cosmetics using the bits of chocolate left behind in the peddler's carriage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>It was Margaret's idea?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Excuse you! You don't have to act so surprised, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>No, no, I believe I do. You actually asked Elizabeth to do something for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>What happened to, "Oh, no, I could never trouble Lizzy with anything"? Asking her to make something that's not even medicine, no less! That's monumental. Earth-shattering, even!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Well, I guess when you put it that way, you're...not wrong. I really wouldn't ordinarily say anything that might bother Lizzy or cause her any trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>I just wanted to see Rainbow Cacao in the hands of the people so badly, it kind of overrode that instinct!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>Huh. So when all is said and done, you're still a merchant at heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>That she is. And besides, it was no trouble for me at all! I loved working with the cacao.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>(And I loved that Margaret felt comfortable enough asking me to. It was indeed the first time she ever has, I suppose!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>I definitely want to try making more after the Rainbow Cacao is legalized, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>I'll be counting on you for a good stock to work with, Margaret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>And I won't let you down! I'll gather up the highest quality Rainbow Cacao and deliver it right to you!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leafa.png" alt="Leafah" height="128"><br>Leafah</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suzu.png" alt="Suzuka" height="128"><br>Suzuka</td>

<td>Uhh, just for the record, you're not allowed to bring any chocolates filled with weird medicine, okay?</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>Wow. Not even going to deny the possibility that Elizabeth might fill her chocolates with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Of course not! And I wouldn't try to stop her if she did. I could never stand in the way of her dreams like that!</td>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Hmm... You know, using Rainbow Cacao to make medicine is all well and good, but perhaps I'll spare some of it to try making chocolate instead, just this once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>I have just the right amount with me, since they allowed me to keep some for medicinal research purposes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>And I should have a good recipe now for making chocolate with energy-boosting properties, so the opportunity is almost too good to pass up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Wow, that sounds awesome! Let's try making some right away. And while we're at it, let's fill some of them with medicine, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>That's a good idea. If we pad the recipe out with regular medicine, we'll be able to make a lot more chocolate overall.</td>
