<td>The Dimension Gate is closing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Did we do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Will they come again, dood? Will they, dood?! I can't take this anymore!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Usalia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Rin...don't worry. No matter how many of them come at us, we'll protect this place, plip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>My phone! It's from the Dimension Prinnies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hello?! What have you idiots been doing...huh? Okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Everyone! It seems like the Dimension Gate has been restored!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The entanglement has been corrected, and, apparently, the Phantom Soldiers aren't showing up anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ufff... Finally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Phew... Looks like we managed to get through all of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Usalia...we...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It looks like we won, plip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah, hello? So anyway...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Now that the Gate's been restored...it looks like we'll be able to go home soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I guess you're all...going home...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Rin...um...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So, you're the ones who fought to protect the town...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>A knight...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The people of the town are there as well, plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I am a knight of this country. Usually, it would be our duty to protect this castle town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Unfortunately, due to our inadequacy, we were unable to defend ourselves against the enemy forces' surprise attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No... It was a large army. There was little you could do withstand them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Not only are you our saviors, but now you console us with your words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Allow me to speak as a representative of this country: you have saved us, and we honor you as heroes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You have our gratitude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey. He called us heroes. Imagine if he found out we're demons...heheheh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's an odd feeling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Rin...sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I couldn't help you make friends...plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's not true. While spending time with all of you...I got to know lots of people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The villagers, the peddlers, the people of Envylia... Although some of them weren't the friendliest of people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I was so happy to meet lots of really kind people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Besides, I really had a lot of fun with you, Usalia. Yip, yip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Although we'll be far apart...I'll never forget you or the people of this world, plip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What is the meaning of this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ma-Madam Overlord Seraphina, what's the matter, dood?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hey, hold on! I won't allow it! Two sardines! No! Three!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hello? Hello?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What's the matter...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The Dimension Prinnies... They said they've been working non-stop, so they'll be taking a paid vacation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>During that time...the Dimension Gate...apparently it won't open.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What goes around comes around, dood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>So, you're all not going home?! Yeah! We can spend more time together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It looks like it...plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh well...I guess we can explore this world a little longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hey! The knights said they're going to hold a feast in honor of us defending this town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Fine then. I'm going on a binge! I'm going to eat and drink as much as I can to make up for the losses I suffered during this adventure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Red Magnus also plans to get super drunk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Foreign cuisine, huh? Maybe I'll ask them to teach me some of their recipes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Sardines?! There are sardines here, dood?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Let's go! Usalia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...All right, plip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(I'm also glad I got to meet Rin.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(I now have a friend in an unknown world, plip.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Phew. It's finally all over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'm sure Sir Killia is impatiently waiting for my return, so let's hurry on back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Huh? It's already all finished?! We still haven't determined who the Super Ultimate Muscle Machine is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I still haven't consumed all the different types of curry throughout Babel, plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>This is a Limited Time Crossover so it's not up to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Our fate has already been sealed...in the Contract.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What? Well...if it says so in the Contract, I guess we should comply.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Come on. Your guys super gave up fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Oh? Well, you're welcome to stay on your own. Usalia and I will have Killia's special curry all to ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>He-hey, wait up a moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Well then, folks of THE ALCHEMIST CODE. Thanks for having us. Hope to see you again someday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Stay healthy, plip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Red Magnus had super fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Bye-byeeee!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>It's still not over yet! Haaahahahah!!!</td>
