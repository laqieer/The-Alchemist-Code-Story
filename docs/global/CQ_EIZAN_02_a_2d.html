<td>002</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Sigh... There's a river nearby. We'll cool off your feet there.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are you hungry? I caught some fish there so let's make it into a meal. If you don't eat, you won't be able to regain your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Please, I can cook. Allow me to do that at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...Use this knife.</td>

<td>Hey, Beardo...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Be-Beardo...?!</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Why did you lie and say you were the Ultimate Blacksmith?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I've...met the Ultimate Blacksmith before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(She's met me before? Now that I think about it...I've seen this noble lady somewhere before.)</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sob...o-ohh... I'm sorry, Reido... I heard there was herbal medicine in this forest that could help you...sob...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...Boy, I'll give you this sword. At least try and become strong enough so that you can use it to protect you and your sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But...this is your sword, old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Watch it, boy! I'm not an "old man" yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Besides, one day I'm going to make the Ultimate Blade, so I don't need that sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm not a boy either... I'm Reido.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Reida, stop crying and thank the man for helping us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Thank you...</td>

<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I didn't know it at the time...but later on, I found out that the man was called the Ultimate Blacksmith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(So this girl was that little kid. Honestly, time flies...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That man had neither your fine beard nor your grey peppered hair. Why do you pretend to be him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(Come on. People change with the passing of years.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If you are really the Ultimate Blacksmith...then I will stab you with this blade!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Thanks to the sword, my brother grew into a wonderful swordsman. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ever since then, my brother never lets the blade leave his side even for a moment. Even when he sleeps, he keeps it next to his bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>He won't even let me sleep in the same bed with him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I, who belong to him completely—from the ends of my hair down to the tips of my toes. My life, my death...all of it belongs to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(Seems like it'll be best for me to keep quiet about the fact that I'm that blacksmith.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, this knife...it reminds me of my brother's blade. Who made it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>W-well now that we've eaten, let's be on our way! There's a cave further ahead where you can find the ore you're looking for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...Are you just going to guide me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(Who would've thought that Reida would be jealous of the blade that I made?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We've arrived. The ore is located deep within here. However, to reach it we'll have to pass through the dens of mythical creatures, so—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hold on, Reido!</td>
</tr>
