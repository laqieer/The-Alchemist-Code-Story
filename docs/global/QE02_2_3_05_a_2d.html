<td>Lord Alvarez, may I speak to you for a moment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We've just received a report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Edgar L. Leonhart has taken Miss Fiona and boarded the convoy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I see...and the mercenary?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>My apologies. We cannot seem to contact him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Never mind. Let him do as he pleases.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>In the case of unforeseen circumstances, that man is our last resort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Do you think it's odd for the creator of Alkaroids to rely on a human?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't overthink it. Humans can sometimes act unpredictably.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Thus, I thought it would be suitable to have a human handle it if such a situation were to occur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>My apologies. I will report to you as soon as Miss Fiona is apprehended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hopefully, Miss Fiona possess the Sacred Stone that Ethan stole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No matter. Once we apprehend Fiona, Ethan will spill everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's no big matter whether that girl has or does not have the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes, sir! Well then... I will go to prepare for the final synchronization test.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Of course. As soon as we reacquire Belphegor, we'll perform the test. Inform this to each location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Father...soon...the day will come...when the evil that infests this world will be wiped out!</td>
