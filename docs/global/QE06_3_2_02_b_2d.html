<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I was born into love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I didn't understand anything, of course. I had no awareness or comprehension. But I distinctly remember the warmth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Next to me was another. My other half, you might say. And when I—when we—looked up, we were greeted with overwhelmingly affectionate smiles from our parents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>They had it hard, for sure. The struggles ahead for them to raise tiny lives whose very existences spark controversy would be so much greater than those borne by other parents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But despite all of that, their smiles never disappeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We've got it pretty good, don't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yeah. We have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Their faces, and their surroundings, spoke the rest. They'd built this life for themselves, and they were genuinely happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I—we—were born into love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Things were off to a promising start for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What? Are you nervous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I didn't say that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There's no reason to be nervous. Here, try holding her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What do you think? Isn't she tiny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes. So tiny, she might break.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hahahahahaha! You certainly do have a way with words. But then, you always have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That something so small can be alive in this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You saw me when I was small, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes, but that was different. I was smaller then, too. And we were locked up shortly after you were born, so there were...other things on my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I don't want yours to have to go through anything like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Don't worry. We'll be here for them. We'll make sure they live their best lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You can count on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You'll be there for them too, Tamba. You're an uncle now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Uncle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Do demons not have that concept?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That doesn't even matter anymore. Demon or human, a brother's a brother, a wife's a wife, and an uncle's an uncle. Isn't that what you always say, Koga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I don't entirely understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>But if they are precious to you, then they are precious to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I will look after them, even at the cost of my own life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>After that, he gingerly stroked our heads so as not to break them—or, more to the point, so as not to hurt us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>His touch conveyed that those hands were there to protect us. They were so gentle and warm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>At least, for a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Before long, however, the malice...took everything from us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>How did they manage to hide their children in a place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We were taken in by Queen Mitsuha of Wadatsumi and raised in Castle Aquila Rubrum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If I may interject, this has been bothering me for some time now: what do you mean by "we"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I mean exactly that. Born into a life of misfortune from a human father, Koga, and a demon mother, Kaede...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Twins, fated to be trifled with by malice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The sister's name, Mikaboshi, and the brother, Sumeragi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>This is their story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>!!!</td>
