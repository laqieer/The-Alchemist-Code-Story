<td>Uzuma...I give you this hourglass. Take good care of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>If anything happens...I'm certain this hourglass will protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(Mother? Mother...where are you? Answer me!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(No...no... My feet are sinking... I can't walk anymore!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(I'm sinking! Ohh...no...I can't...breath...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's...morning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(I'm...alive.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It woke me up again today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You're going out early today, "Mina."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Gotta work! That's right, old man! I heard there was a famous fortuneteller in this town. Do you know where I can find her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh, are you talking about Uzuma? She does her fortune-telling at the corner of the square where there aren't too many people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...But she's got a dark atmosphere about her. Besides, there are some bad rumors about her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Bad rumors? Is she a fraud?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No, not those kinds of rumors. Her divinations are certainly accurate, but...she sees things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>She sees people's deaths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>When she foresees someone's death, they really do die. Some believe that she uses her power of divination to kill off people who badmouth her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Thus, she's received the nickname Messenger of Death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hmm. Messenger of Death, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I don't know what business you have with her, but I'd stay away from her if I were you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Sorry for keeping you waiting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Seriously! You're late, dad! Come on! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>At least let me eat my breakfast in peace. Honestly, you're so impatient. Who raised you this way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hahahah. Indeed, I wonder who. Reminds me a lot of a strapping lad I knew. He was filled with energy and vigor, always running about where he pleased.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Tsk. Right. Oh, by the way...breakfast was delicious, old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Thanks for everything. Take care of yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey, enough with the formalities, "Uhara"! You make it sound like this is our final farewell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Come and drop by the next time you're around these parts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Heh. Will do, old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Dad, hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Fine, fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>"Uhara", huh? This pseudonym has come in handy over the years. All right, let's go Miuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Finally!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(The hourglass...the falling sands... It calms me...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>... ...! Fate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(Today...someone will die again... Maybe...it will be me!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(That tree that is supposed to be protecting us...is gone now... My mother...is gone now...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I wish this divination...were wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Uzuma...the feared fortuneteller, known as the Messenger of Death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The father and daughter hurry to her, these two who will one day be remembered as the legendary blacksmiths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>When these three meet, the sands of destiny will reverse their flow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>And when every last grain of sand has fallen, they will arriveâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(That man...will find a gold coin on the ground, but...he will gamble with it...and ultimately suffer immense loss.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(The lady's husband is having an affair with a barmaid...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Sigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(Why do I always see such bad things?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Found you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(What a frightening man! Who is he?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh! There she is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You're the fortuneteller called Uzuma!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Um...ye-yes, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(Huh? That man from a moment ago is gone...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>We want you to divine the whereabouts of what we're searching for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...Hey, are you listening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Miuna, it's rude to ask like that. Seriously, who raised you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You did, dad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Ack. Ah...anyway, putting that aside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Ah, Uzuma, was it? Do you know about the mineral called Sephirium?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Sephirium...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You do?! Please, tell us where it is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>In the past, it could often be mined around here, but now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>We know that. Right now, it's a rare mineral, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It's absolutely necessary that we obtain it. We want you to divine its whereabouts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Ve-very...well. I will divine your request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...From mercy to severity...the road of force...sublimity to...forever? Furthered ahead...the road of majesty...oh, no...it collapses!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Origins, kingdom...is this the road of judgment? No...the reversing tides of the desert! There...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>U-um...I didn't really understand that, but...is there still some Sephirium lying around?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...Yes. It is within the Temporal Cave...hidden in the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hey, who's sneaking around back there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...You're the man I saw earlier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I've finally found you...Uzuma. I'll have you come with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Miuna, take her and run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Eeek...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Don't let her get away! Chase her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Huff...huff... O-ohh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>They're still chasing us, huh? Miuna, can you manage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Leave it to me, dad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>So you've given up, huh? Now hand Uzuma to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>No way! We still have questions we need to be answered!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Are you going to resist us? What can one little girl do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Hey. Take Uzuma by force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>How dare you make fun of me! I'll tear you to pieces!</td>
</tr>
