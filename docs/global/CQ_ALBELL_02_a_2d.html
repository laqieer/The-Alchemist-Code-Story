<td>Sigh... What's wrong with them? Who tries to take someone by force?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It seems like they want to use my fortune-telling abilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yeah, I guessed as much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Albea, thank you for saving me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's fine. After all, I need to talk with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I want to listen to what you have to say, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What is it now? They're not here anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No. But the stars are still badly aligned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>They seem quite serious today. More of them will come today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Please, run away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No. I have an older brother. He used to be a skilled Alchemist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Used to be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes. He serves in the Holy Guard. Apparently, he's not an Alchemist anymore. Besides, I've never met him once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What I really want to know about is my brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tell me! Is he still alive? If he is, where is he? What kind of person is he?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I would like to read your fortune, but there's no time. They're closing in again. Please, hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's for me to decide. And I have no intention of running away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If more of them are coming, I'll take them out. Then, I'll have you read my fortune.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You're surprisingly stubborn. Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I get that a lot. I'm called the "stubborn artisan."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Heheh. It's perfect for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yeah? I don't really understand it myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...! Here they come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Deneb! How dare you treat my subordinates like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>They really are persistent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh? Who are you? Oh, well that's a pretty face you've got on you. How about we sell you off as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What? You're a vile and greedy bunch, aren't you? I'm under no obligation to follow your orders!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Shut up! Both of you come quietly! If you don't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You'll suffer for it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We'll see who does the suffering!</td>
</tr>
