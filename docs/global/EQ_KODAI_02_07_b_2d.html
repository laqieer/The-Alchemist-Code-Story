<td>Esai…! You're going too far!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I know, but I have to…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>…! Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The gunfire just crumbled the pillars of this underground cavern...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>How do we get out…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…</td>

<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Now there is no escape to the surface for you. But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The weight of the Dragon Realm cannot bring me down, as I see it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If I forcibly open a hole up above…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Owwwww….!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Stay calm, Schmeier. I need to put this ointment on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A savior! I'm the savior, alright? Ow! Please do it more gently…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Alright, there you go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Making a hole for an escape plan like that… That is certainly an achievement for a dragon…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>"It's been a while since I've used all my power at once, so I have muscle pain." Doesn't that sound pathetic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, but… For the last hundred years I've dedicated myself to research…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>His name was Esai, correct? He'll probably return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Most likely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Things might not be as lucky for us next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Then why are you so carefree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well, we'll be prepared when the time comes. Though I'm glad to have some reliable allies around me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ouch…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Aedith, the injury on your belly still hurts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yeah… But I won't give out with just this. It'll take more than this to kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But will we really receive help from that dragon? Schmeier, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yeah, as Ignacio betrayed her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>For us, we have no choice but to rely on her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If you can improve the city with dragon technology, then why not have that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I love the city…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But if there isn't change, we won't survive. That's just how the world is right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Aedith… If that's what you say…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's late. Brush your teeth before going to bed. Also, don't call me Aedith at home. Call me Father, alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Y-yes… Good night. Father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>A father that teaches his daugher to kill… How cruel…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But we, the helpless people, have to do this to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>To betray or become betrayed… Terrible positions either way, but the strongest will survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That Yishai Ignacio… Why did he miss my vital organs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Shahel, you're back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes. Fifty have been rolled out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Is that all that is necessary?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>About Schmeier. It was thought that we could retrieve her if we had used our full force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>There's no point to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Schmeier, like Ophioneus is leading towards the life of a Cursed Dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>For that reason, despair was the path…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Schmeier is a wonderful person. She is merciful and kind to all. So losing her will spread despair further…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The people of the Sloth Layer will become the sacrifice…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Understood…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It seems that there isn't much time left for the impending human filth in this layer. Ophioneus…</td>
