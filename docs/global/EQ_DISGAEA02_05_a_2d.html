</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yeah, but I'm also talking about the Phantom Soldiers we weren't able to defeat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh. Some of them did escape. Are you going to take them out as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Of course! If I were to let my opponents escape, it would ruin my reputation as Overlord!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm not sure you have enough of a reputation to ruin, Prince...</td>

<td>Dood...sob...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Both the prince and Master Etna treat us Prinnies with such selfishness...always working is so hard, dood!</td>

<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Weren't you just reflecting on how maybe you were overly harsh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Y-you, idiot! Don't give it away! Besides, that was because Almira was using the proximity of her mammary glands to force the words out of me!</td>

<td>Give me a raise, dood!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yeah, that's not gonna happen.</td>

<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>More importantly, more and more Phantom Soldiers are emerging from that weird light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Nooo, doood! I'm surrounded, doood!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hold on, Prinny! I can't raise your salary...but I won't allow anyone to lay their hands on my vassal!</td>
