<td>Awake now, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Flamel...! Wh-where's Mielikki?! A-augh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Don't force yourself to get up. Your power ran amok, and you lost consciousness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't worry about Mielikki. She's gone to tend to her flower bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh, right. The flower bed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I was unable to capture your assailants. Forgive me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>N-no, that's my line. I'm sorry I caused so much trouble...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...They were after your crystals. I suppose Michael was right to be concerned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Is there any veracity to their claim? That your crystals have the power to remove curses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...One of the guys involved in my experiment said something to that effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Still, any attempt they made to remove curses seemed to end in failure. That power must be beyond me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>In fact, all this power's done is put Mielikki in danger. Even take her precious beloved flowers, and—</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Celliers, you're awake! Thank the stars!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Mielikki...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...Are you okay, Celliers? You're not looking too hot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm... I'm so sorry, Mielikki. Your precious flowerbed, I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You, nothing! You didn't do anything wrong! It's those jerks that caused this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You saw them stomp all over my flowers, and got upset on my behalf, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But they were after me. That makes this all my fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Celliers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...Um, perhaps the two of you would accompany me to our laboratory for now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You should go into hiding for now—Celliers, of course, but you as well, Mielikki. They've seen your face, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We have ample security at the laboratory. Even if they show up, we can drive them away. What do you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hmm... What do you think, Celliers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...I'm for it. If this happens again, the villagers might be the next ones caught in the crossfire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(And if anything else were to happen to Mielikki, I...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Okay, then it's settled! If you're going, I'm going, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Very well. We should set up at once.</td>
