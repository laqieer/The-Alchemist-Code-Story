<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Well, that was fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You're all incredible. Magnificent, even!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You've shown me new techniques, new forms, and new battle tactics. So many novel and exciting things to study and master! Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So creepy... She's covered in blood, but still smiling. Hey! Mira! Hurry up and get your butt over here, pronto!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>"Quit talking nonsense! I'm on my way, but I'm carrying Daphne. She's hurt. You need to just get out of there!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Crap. I hate to say it, but she's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, by all means! Let's end this now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>She cut through my time distortion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No, I cut through your magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>See, your magil is very distinctive. It's exceptionally easy for me to pick it out from the surrounding magil, Space-Time Manipulator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What kind of unfair nonsense is that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(What do we do now?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(Eulalia and I don't have any other tricks to use on her. So please, I really need you to—)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>"I told you, I can't! Daphne's life is on the line!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(Yeah... Okay. Well, in that case...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Eulalia? Don't move! Your wounds will open back up again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Tell me...why you're so sad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Are you talking to me? I'm having the time of my life right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Only because you were hoping someone would take that life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>After I shot you, you looked so...at peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Silence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You wanted someone to take you out in battle, didn't you? You came here to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If, by some chance, a miracle should occur, and I should be able to fight on behalf of another once again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I would not hesitate for a moment. I would delight in spilling more blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I... I would—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If you really just came here to die, then we owe you an apology. We weren't fighting you for that purpose. We were just buying some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Again? Honestly, this is getting...so old...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Okay, who's next?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Mira, you made it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So the others got away after all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Eulalia, was it? When one is shamed upon the battlefield, it's only natural to respond with one's sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I should go after them before they get too far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But I'm a bit too spent for that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Grrrooooooggghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Perfect timing. I could use a little snack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm in need of some magil. This lot doesn't look particularly tasty, but they'll have to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Phew... Are we there yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Sorry to tell you, we've still got a lot of ground to cover. The tower is comprised of Cursed Beast shrines, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We've got at least four more to go before the scenery changes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That's not so bad. Try to focus for a while longer, Adaleigh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Just a bit more, all right? We can do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Y-yeah! No problem!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It's kind of surreal to think about. This, right here, is the party we're taking into the final battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You mean, the five of us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yeah. Kinda takes me back a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Remember? We started this whole adventure back in the Gula Belt region, and faced off against Nidhogg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's right. There were five of us back then, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>See what I mean? Kind of like we're fighting again for old time's sake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Except this time, we're going in a lot more prepared. We've been through a lot, and accomplished so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm not so sure about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Excuse me?! This is supposed to be the part where you enthusiastically agree with me! That's how these pre-fight pep talks usually go, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hahaha. Yes, you're dead-on with that part. But the thing is... We really don't know what awaits us at the end of all this. Nor what's going to happen when the battle is over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hmph. I mean, you're not wrong. But you don't gotta say it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Anyhow, it's time for us to pick up the pace. Let's move, people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Ack! What's this shaking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>An earthquake?! Nah, that can't be it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...Of course. Kind of saw this coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Grooooooooooaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Grrooooooooooooarrrrrrrrrgghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Mammon and Belphegor? Two Cursed Beasts at the same time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Seems we've left quite an impression on Ouroboros, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>So be it. I will stay—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Not this time! We should be the ones to stay behind here. Right, old dog?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Well, they don't have their cores this time, so I think that twisted body of Greed might actually be manageable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>And this could be the perfect opportunity for me to test out the reforged Taurus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Adaleigh... Yna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>These are shadows made of magil! A pair of humans fighting a pair of Cursed Beasts is absurd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I wouldn't underestimate us. The two of us are more than capable of dealing with the two of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Trust me. Me and the old dog can handle this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You gotta keep going. There's seriously no time to lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Right! We'll beat 'em in a jiff, and catch back up with you before you even have time to miss us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...All right. Thank you. Both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Yna. Adaleigh. Come back in one piece, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Adaleigh.. Yna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Go on! Get going! You've got to look after Emmel and Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I regret that we won't be by your side to see this thing through to the very end, but rest assured, we will take care of this little bump in the road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You just focus on keeping my good friend Nimul safe and sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Good! Now that that's out of the way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Quakes and lightning... We'll be facing attacks from above and below. There will be nowhere to take refuge. Keep your wits about you. One misstep could be fatal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>No problem! We've beaten these guys once before. Let's go, old dog!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Do I even have to say it anymore?</td>
</tr>
