<td>Who are you? No—Where are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What a weird question... Did you hit your head somewhere?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm Lachesis! You created me, remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Lache...sis?</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, I guess you fell really hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But you remember our time with the Elylon Teg, at least... Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's how we got to know them. How we got to help them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Soren, they need you more than ever now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wait! None of this makes sense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Don't go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Find me, Soren!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ugh... Where...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What the—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hmph. Looks like Red really did knock you into next week.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Be a good boy and sleep for another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You've caused enough trouble as it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Soren, now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>

<td>Red's massive greatsword shatters the gate to the sewers.</td>

<tr>

<td>Heh heh... *cough*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Thanks for the escape route. Now, go!</td>

<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Come on, Eira.</td>

<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Emmy...</td>

<tr>

<td>Let's go.</td>

<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No... Emmy...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, for the love of— Roxanne!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Take Eira and go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Emrys can't hold her off by himself. He's severely injured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Of all the times to be stubborn—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I know what I'm doing, Blair. I always do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I won't forgive you if you die, Rox.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Soren! You're all right! Shion too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We heard the blast from here. Good thing the tunnels are interconnected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ugh, I wake up and the first thing that happens is a tunnel collapse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Not planning to, little girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(That incredible aura...What IS that?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Heh... Playing at heroes now, are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Go on, Red. Show her my true power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I hunger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hah. All you'll be getting is a banquet of rubble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>As Roxanne pulls out her guns, she gives a final look at Shion and Soren, and smiles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>This isn't the last you'll see of me. Not by a long shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Oh, I look forward to annoying you for years to come, Miss Roxanne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Roxanne?! Wait! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We'll meet again soon, everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>(Emrys...I hope you're out of range for this!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The charged shots strike the crates, igniting the tunnel in a cascade of white-hot flame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>A section of tunnel directly above Red and Roxanne collapses in a deafening crash, sealing their fates in rubble...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Ngh...Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>(I must have broken over half of the bones in my body or something.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>(At least I managed to bury that demon girl.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Aahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Well now. It's been one surprise after another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What a hunt indeed...but at least I have a consolation prize right here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>How are you...still alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>That stupid barrier the little man put up had a...rather convenient side effect of being a shield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Save for ringing ears and a mess to clean up, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Now, I've had enough of your little games.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Lilith draws back her bow with a cruel smirk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Sieg...My one and only love—</td>

<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Live well.</td>
