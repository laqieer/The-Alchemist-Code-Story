<td>Tch! You'll regret this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I already do. I regret that I wasted my energy against a bunch of weaklings, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hey, you. Yeah, you! I have a bone to pick with you. Did you even listen to a word your brother said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>He told you to take it easy, because you're not used to being a Phantom yet, and he doesn't want you getting yourself into any trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So what? There was no way I was gonna lose to a bunch of cowards like those idiots. I'm strong enough to keep myself out of trouble, and I could've taken them on without your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Can't argue with you there. You're talented, I'll give you that. Just what I'd expect from Fraise's little brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tch. Cut that out, will you? I'm way stronger than my brother, because I'm not wrapped up in all that sentimental crap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>In fact, it's downright insulting to compare me to a sleazebag like him. Getting all worked up over a stupid convention like White Day... That's low.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hahah! A stupid convention, huh? You must feel very strongly about it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm just telling it like it is. Love and passion only serve to make men weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A stupid...convention?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I think it's about time you grew up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This day means a lot to your brother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>How can you go around calling something so important to him "stupid"?! You don't know anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wh-what the hell are you yelling at me for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Y'know... I can't really say I agree with you, either, Gino.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Tch. Then I guess that makes you a sappy loser too, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You keep saying that, but it's not all about love and passion. It's more like... How should I put this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Some men, like myself, find strength in the love they hold for another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm thankful to the woman who made me strong, and I draw strength from that gratitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Basically, White Day is just a nice excuse to show your appreciation for someone you care about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Fraise is grateful to Eve, and that's why he's celebrating today. There's really nothing bad about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Kevin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hmph. What a joke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>He's always been strong, and if he had devoted himself to swordsmanship, he would've just kept getting stronger and stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But then he started getting friendly with that woman, got caught up in his feelings for her, and grew weak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ugh! You...! Just because you don't care about love, that doesn't mean that nobody else should! Don't force your beliefs onto others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What is up with you, anyway?! You keep calling Eve "that woman." What has she done to deserve that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Nothing! Absolutely...nothing. She's done nothing wrong. I know that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>He's the one to blame. Letting himself go all soft... There's nothing to be gained from beating someone like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Someone's gotta bring him to his senses, and it's going to be me. I need to go up against him and win, fair and square, when he's at his full strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ah, crap. I was hoping to talk him down, but it looks like it had the opposite effect, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Aaarghh! Wh-what are these things?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Numa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What the hell?! What are all these Rattys doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Please! Help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hmph. Perfect! This gives me a chance to show you what I can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I've trained hard, day after day, doing everything in my power to strengthen myself so that I can surpass my brother. Watch and learn!</td>
</tr>
