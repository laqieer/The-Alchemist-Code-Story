<td>Don't get any closer! I'll cut this kid's head off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ack... You vile scum! Let the hostage go and surrender yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why would I listen to the likes of you, you suzerain dogs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Mommy...help...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, Sir Paladins! Please, help my child...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What should we do? We can't afford to let the bandit escape, but, if we move now, the girl will be killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Argh... It's between capturing the bandit or saving the hostage's life...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Heheh. Yes. You better not move. You have no choice but to let us escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Agyaahhh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>He killed the bandit without a moment's hesitation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Mommy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, thank you! Thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, that was quite the dangerous stunt to pull off. I guess we should give it up for our "hero" Dias. He couldn't care less about the hostage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>How can you call yourselves Paladins when you don't even know how to save a hostage from a bandit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're useless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(There's no point in bringing them along with me. They'll just get in the way.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'll take down the bandits on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(Useless...huh? Who would've thought a day would come when I would be throwing that term at someone...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You useless brat! Stop lazing around and work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Your parents died in the war and you're being fed and clothed by the kindness of the neighboring village! Work harder and pay back your debt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yuffie! You again? Stop dropping our special cargo, you useless brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Stop! Don't hit Yuffie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What's that? Dias, are you gonna defy your elders again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yuffie's body is weak! I'll work enough for both of us! That's fine, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Dias...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, well, what a reliable older brother. Still, you better not let it get to your head!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That's enough for now. Let him be. He says that he'll work enough for both of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Understood...Mayor...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Thank you, Mayor! I'll work as hard as I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We'll be relying on you. Let Yuffie get some rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>They made you work so hard. This is all we have to eat... So much for being fed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Dias...eat this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yuffie? Sorry for making you worry. I'm fine so you eat it all yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No. I'm full already...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Of course, she isn't... As her older brother, I need to do better by her.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hyahhh! This work is nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well, you're in high spirits, aren't you, Dias? If you're gonna work for your sister's portion as well then lend me a hand over here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Got it! I'll do anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(Ack... This isn't two people's portion. They're making me work at least three times as hard. I've gotta keep a calm face in front of Yuffie.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Dias, look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hm? It's a small but really beautiful flower. Where did you find it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>There were many of them blossoming near the village. I thought if I let them grow in the vase, they'll make this house look gorgeous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Thank you, Yuffie. I'll do my best too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hey, Dias...do you know the language of the flowers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Mom taught it to me before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I don't...for starters, what's the name of this flower?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It's a begonia. Tomorrow I'll tell you what it represents in the language of the flowers. Try to give it some thought, Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Fine. Let's go to bed now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hey, Dias! Help over here today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Fine, I'll do it! Whether it be two or three people's share of work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That guy made me slave away until dark... I wonder if Yuffie ate properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(That's right. I didn't have time to think about the language of the flowers.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm home...Yuffie! Are you still awake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yuffie, what's the matter! Yuffie! Hey! Your throat...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Mayor! I need your help! Yuffie's throat...her throat...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Ah, Dias. I need to talk about it with you as well. We've found a buyer for Yuffie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>A buyer...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Rejoice! A noble took a liking to Yuffie and decided to purchase her. He seems to share some kind of...well...benevolent hobby.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Just as a precaution, since he didn't want to hear her crying or shouting while playing, he asked if I could crush her throat beforehand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>So I just gave her some medicine to drink that would crush her throat. That's all it does, so don't worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...That's all it does? Are you serious, you vile piece of scum?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What's that? An aristocrat is gonna buy your useless brat of a sister! How about you have a little more gratitude?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Shut up! Shut up! Yuffie... Give back Yuffie her voice! Give it back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>The kid is acting like he's possessed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hey, you! Go beat this brat outside!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I can make more money from selling Yuffie than if you worked all your life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Just because a worthless, incompetent piece of trash like you works twice as hard...it doesn't give you any bragging rights!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Argh! Yuffie...! How dare you treat Yuffie that way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yuffie, you're a valuable commodity so come this way! Forget about Dias.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>... ...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Yuffie! Yuffie...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Shut up, you brat! Do you want me to kill you out of spite?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What are all of you doing there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Back then, I was powerless. I couldn't protect Yuffie. Ultimately, the mayor and the villagers ended up beating me to an inch of my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>That was when he saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Hey, Paladin. Did you come all the way here alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Hehehe. A risk-taker, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I see. It looks like that's the bandits' hideout. An odd twist of fate...</td>
