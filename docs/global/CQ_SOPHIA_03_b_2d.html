<td>Aghh... What incredible power! It's wrong for an elf like you to be in this town in the first place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>

<td>If you're gonna be in the world of humans, you'd better learn to do our bidding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What a horrible thing to say...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This is not a matter of race! How dare you think you could use another to do your bidding? You should be ashamed of yourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There's no way I'm letting you people get away with this!</td>

<td>Soleil, are you hurt? Sorry for getting you messed up in all of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sophia...I'm glad you're okay! Don't ever think of yourself as trouble! You're a gentle and good girl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Thank you, Soleil...</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh. It looks like it's already morning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wow, you're right! Would you like to have some tea at my house?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tea sounds great, but, after all that moving around, I think I'm quite hungry. Would you like to have an early breakfast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes! Oh, that restaurant over there is renowned for its meat cuisine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This one is famous for its pasta and fish! U-Umm... Which one should we choose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Heheh. How about this restaurant then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>They have meat and fish, and their pasta and bread look delicious. It's also located right in front of your house, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I've never eaten at this restaurant before. I'm always contemplating whether to eat here or not and, during that time, it always gets full.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But, since I'm with you today, Sophia...and you've decided for us, we can go inside! I'm so excited! It's a really popular restaurant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Soleil, this freshly-baked bread is so delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This fettuccine is wonderful as well! Mmm! So delicious! Sophia, let's come here again together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes, we must. That's a promise.</td>
