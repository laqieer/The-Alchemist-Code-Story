<td>Luke</td>
<td>Skrrrraaaaarrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>That was the last of them. As I expected, mindless corruption is no match for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>You did so well, Luke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Luke</td>
<td>Skree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>You fought by controlling a dragon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>You did not rely on your strength alone, but borrowed the power of another more suited to fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>That is its own strength, one might say. And what lies beyond that is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>Lord Kubera...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>It appears the next obstacle has arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>Huh? Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Although they may not have will of their own, it seems they can sense what is in the workshop behind us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>That a blade able to eradicate their master is being made there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>They can't be allowed to stop my brother's work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Luke</td>
<td>Skree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Wait. Rushing in without a plan is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>She has gained a curious strength, but she is still unaware of the ways of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>To think that I would babysit a child!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>To fight to protect someone. To fight for something I believe in. I see. This is a strength we know nothing of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>However, if this strength is necessary, we will obtain it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>So that we, the people of Avaritia, will reach higher realms!</td>

<td>Yna</td>
<td>Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Hmmm. With this technique...this material would be a little brittle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>How was this problem solved in previous Gears of Judgment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>We used a special resin ore called Sephirium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>It was crafted from the magil of the Cursed Beast of Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>I see. To withstand sin magil, the same sin magil is required.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Although, under the circumstances, I do not wish to continue using it. That is why we will use this instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>What is this sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>In the future, humans will attain gear that can defeat the Beasts. This is a prototype of that gear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Prototype - Dragonslayer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>This blade contains the material I spoke of earlier, Sephirium. If we melt it down and reforge it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>It could be turned into new gear. That is a good plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Ready your iron hammer, Yna. We will now begin forging the Gear of Judgement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>On it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Fabulous work, Yna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>I am amazed at what you've accomplished. With this quality of work, you are ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>From this day forth, you may call yourself Yna Ku.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>That's... This technique... The me of this time would never be able to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Even so, so long as you reach this level one day, there will be no issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Heh. With this, my final duty has come to an end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>I have grasped the theory behind the Gears of Judgment. All that is left is to achieve that singlular form with our labor and tenacity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Match my breathing, Yna. From here on out, we'll be shortening our lives and shrinking time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Yes, Master!</td>
