<td>Hey, why is the Supreme Commander in such a bad mood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The battle is going even better than we had expected. What's she got to be unhappy about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What are you muttering about? Do you have something you want to say to me? If so, spit it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ah! N-no! N-nothing! My apologies, Supreme Commander!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Tch. This lot doesn't have an inch of backbone between them. At least they're smart enough to fear my wrath, unlike somebody I know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I thought I was going to fall into the sea! You know, working out there on the ocean is tough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You're as clumsy as ever, I see. It's difficult to believe you manage to function as a spy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ah, the sea breeze was just sublime! Do you ever go swimming in the sea, Mei Fang? You must get to go all the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Me? Of course not. Don't be stupid. I would never stoop so low as that. I am the Supreme Commander of the Greed Dike Navy, not a child!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Really? That's a shame. I thought we could splash around together some time. The sea is so much fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Vivi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, that's right! I brought you back a present!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A present?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's really cute! Here you go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Th-this is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's kinda squishy, right? Isn't it cute? It's called a sea cucumber!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>M-Mei Fang?! What's wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Y-you...buffoon! How dare you throw a s-sea cucumber at me?! It's hideous! It doesn't even have feet! What is wrong with you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh? You don't like it? I'm sorâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I suppose you're going to report this weakness of mine to your master now? Well?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh?! Of course not! I would never do that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hmph. How should I know? You are a spy, after all. You cannot be trusted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Come on, Mei Fang...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Are you that afraid of trusting someone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I understand where you're coming from, but you should be able to trust me at least! We're friends, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Being suspicious of everyone all the time must be tiring...and lonely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Mei Fang?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Get out of my sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I don't know you. I never want to see your face again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Nngh, even remembering that day gives me goosebumps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I cannot tolerate creatures without feet, whether they be snakes or sea cucumbers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I really cannot fathom why she thought that giving such a thing as a present would be a good idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh, that's right! I brought you back a present!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm sure she didn't mean any harm, but worst of all was what she said next.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I haven't seen her for a while...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Perhaps she really won't come back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I did nothing wrong! She was mistaken to bring me such a thing, and I was undeserving of those words!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Well, no matter. It makes little difference to me whether I see that buffoon again or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Supreme Commander! We are under attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Tch, just as I expected. How dull... We're going to wipe the floor with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Soldiers of Greed Dike! Trust in my command and we will decimate the enemy!</td>
</tr>
