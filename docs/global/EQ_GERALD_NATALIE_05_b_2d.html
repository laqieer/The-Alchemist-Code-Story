<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Finally awake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I... H-huh?! What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You must be pretty out of it if you can't figure that out. I'm carrying you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I-I know that much! It's just that it's embarrassing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You lost consciousness. You weren't in any state to walk on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>S-still...! Wait... What happened with the bandits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Incapacitated and bound. I instructed the Scarlet Legion to hand them over to the Envylian Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's...good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Thank you, Natalie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>F-for what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You really opened my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heheh. Guess I can put that dissection on hold then, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You really intend to do that someday?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Assuming you keep sparking. Someone's got to do something about that! It might as well be me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Gerald...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You were right. I've been comparing myself. To him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Leading the Scarlet Legion, I began to wonder which was more important: strength like steel or a light as bright as the sun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, look at you, being all honest with yourself. And to even admit that I'm right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I no longer have any doubts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Perhaps you are more suited to leading the Scarlet Legion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But I am who I am, and that is enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Even if you forsake your vows, I will see them through to the end, the way that only I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Driven by my iron will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Natalie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Here and now, I vow to protect those I care for in my own way, regardless of how long that may take.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>So, please...remain by my side. Support me as you will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>G-Gerald, I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Of course I will, you idiot! Who else could support a sensitive, stubborn fool like you? It has to be me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Good. I'm counting on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hey... Can I ask you something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>How long do you intend on carrying me?! I can walk now! Clearly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Why don't we go eat something sweet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Y-you're going to put me down first, right? We're not walking into town like this! No way! Put me down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Just let me carry you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Something you want to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's just... You're smiling. I haven't seen you smile in so long...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I promised dad that I'd...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Stop right there! Let the memory itself be enough. You don't have to put it all into words for me to understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We're going to stay together, right? That's all that matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You're right. Let's go, Natalie. Together.</td>
