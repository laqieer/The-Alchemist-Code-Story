<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Mikaboshi, now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Got it! Hyaaaaaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Mikaboshi! Sumeragi! Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha, what's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's spreading like a disease. More and more people keep turning into demons. It's absolute pandemonium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's not possible, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I wouldn't have thought so either, but it's hard to deny what's happening right in front of our eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The soldiers you just fought are from one of the regiments that was guarding an afflicted village. If we're to assume this is, in fact, some sort of disease...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Well, then we have to assume that everyone who's come in contact with that village is at risk of transforming, unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So you do think it's a disease, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I do. And as of yet, there's no cure. We're going to have to find one, though, before everyone in Wadatsumi turns into a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This is awful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Could it be mutation? But if so, what's the trigger? It just doesn't add up! None of this makes any sense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>People turning into demons out of the blue...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>News of this new "disease" spread quickly throughout Wadatsumi, and exaggeration and hearsay only served to heighten the people's fear and dread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>As a precaution, Queen Mitsuha had the villages where the infection was confirmed evacuated and burned to ash, in hopes of containing any remaining trace of the disease.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It was a necessary precaution, but the end result is that livable space within Wadatsumi was dwindling fast, and nowhere was fully out of the reach of demons anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This only amplified the distrust people already felt toward Queen Mitsuha, and the fear they already had toward demonkind in general.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And wherever distrust and fear are permitted to grow, corruption is sure to follow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Reports came in that the monument sealing away the Demon Paragon had begun to crack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The seal was weakening, and the Discarnate Power trapped within was at risk of being set free once more. Queen Mitsuha had no choice but to act quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I don't have time to second-guess myself. I chose to bear this responsibility. I must now own up to that choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Please, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Why are you standing in my way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Tell me, Lady Mitsuha, what's inside that syringe you're trying to conceal from my sight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That's no concern of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Is it demon blood, perchance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Do you mean to sacrifice yourself to strengthen the seal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That is my intent, yes. There is no other way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I told you, you don't need to do this alone. You've always been free to ask for my help, and I insist you do so now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The weight of this decision is too much to bear for your shoulders, Lady Mitsuha. Yet, if you are prepared to bear it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Then we, your faithful followers, must be equally prepared to give our lives for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What have you done?! This was my responsibility, not yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It is Wadatsumi's responsibility. We must be in this together, and this country must live on! The only burden you need to bear... No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The only burden we wish you to bear is that of our gratitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Let us do what we can for a better tomorrow. I gladly offer my body to this grim fate, as I know my sacrifice will not be in vain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>If someone must do this, then...that someone should be me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'm so sorry for this. Or maybe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It would be more appropriate to say, thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Thus, the consciousness of the Demon Paragon was transferred to this new host and suspended within the massive gemstone that comprised the nucleus of the monument.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The citizen who'd confronted Mitsuha and taken on the role of Kago had even willingly injected himself with demon blood to give the seal the best possible chance of holding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The one who went through with this ritual was given the unsettlingly poetic name of Kagomurasaki, meaning "caged violet."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But with some lingering concerns over the seal weakening, some took it upon themselves to erect a statue as well, in an effort to augment the seal's effects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If one layer of protection isn't enough, it only makes sense to add another, after all. Yet this precautionary measure only served to draw further attention to the Kagomurasaki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The people realized that a sacrifice had taken place, and they were outraged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>On top of the panic that was already present from the disease, things had now reached a boiling point. There was no quelling the crowds anymore. They were out for blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>And naturally, much of this outrage was directed squarely at the twins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You're harboring demon children! What kind of message does that send?! You need to kill them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I don't think our queen even has a human heart anymore. How can she, when she's willing to sacrifice her own people just to keep the Demon Paragon at bay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It's her fault we're in this mess to begin with! She thinks we can make peace with demons! Look where that's gotten us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Our families were killed and driven from our villages, yet those demon children get to live in luxury! They should be slaughtered like pigs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The queen is just as guilty as the demon children for protecting them! She must accept divine punishment for ruining our lives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Don't listen to them. This is all on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I may not be able to protect you outside these walls, but at least let me see to it that you're safe within them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>But, Lady Mitsuha, this is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It's natural, is what it is. I want to protect my children. And though the people have seen fit to place much of the blame on you two, those impulses belie their true complaints.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It's my countermeasures against the demons they can't accept. Not you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>But I'm prepared. I'm prepared to bear it. The harsh words of my citizens cut me no deeper than your youthful criticisms did. I accept them all, and pledge to make amends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I will fix this. I'm just so sorry you had to get caught up in it. It's so unfair to you. I think...you should just return to your rooms for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Halt! Stop right there! You are in the presence of Lady Mitsuha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>We should have never made peace with demons. It was a mistake from the start! How could you not see that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>If we'd just kept fighting them, we would've wiped them out, and I wouldn't have lost my wife and children!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>It's all your fault!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Be careful, Lady Mitsuha! He has a weapon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Aaaaaarrrgggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Mikaboshi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Mikaboshi? You...protected me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Mikaboshi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>......</td>
