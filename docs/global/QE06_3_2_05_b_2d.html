<td>The soldiers you just fought are from one of the regiments that was guarding an afflicted village. If we're to assume this is, in fact, some sort of disease...</td>
</tr>

<td>Well, then we have to assume that everyone who's come in contact with that village is at risk of transforming, unfortunately.</td>

<td>So you do think it's a disease, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I do. And as of yet, there's no cure. We're going to have to find one, though, before everyone in Wadatsumi turns into a demon.</td>

<td>News of this new "disease" spread quickly throughout Wadatsumi, and exaggeration and hearsay only served to heighten the people's fear and dread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>As a precaution, Queen Mitsuha had the villages where the infection was confirmed evacuated and burned to ash, in hopes of containing any remaining trace of the disease.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>It was a necessary precaution, but the end result is that livable space within Wadatsumi was dwindling fast, and nowhere was fully out of the reach of demons anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>This only amplified the distrust people already felt toward Queen Mitsuha, and the fear they already had toward demonkind in general.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>The weight of this decision is too much to bear for your shoulders, Lady Mitsuha. Yet, if you are prepared to bear it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>Then we, your faithful followers, must be equally prepared to give our lives for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>What have you done?! This was my responsibility, not yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>It is Wadatsumi's responsibility. We must be in this together, and this country must live on! The only burden you need to bear... No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>The only burden we wish you to bear is that of our gratitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You...</td>

<td>Let us do what we can for a better tomorrow. I gladly offer my body to this grim fate, as I know my sacrifice will not be in vain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>If someone must do this, then...that someone should be me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>I'm so sorry for this. Or maybe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>It would be more appropriate to say, thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Thus, the consciousness of the Demon Paragon was transferred to this new host and suspended within the massive gemstone that comprised the nucleus of the monument.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>The citizen who'd confronted Mitsuha and taken on the role of Kago had even willingly injected himself with demon blood to give the seal the best possible chance of holding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>The one who went through with this ritual was given the unsettlingly poetic name of Kagomurasaki, meaning "caged violet."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>But with some lingering concerns over the seal weakening, some took it upon themselves to erect a statue as well, in an effort to augment the seal's effects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>If one layer of protection isn't enough, it only makes sense to add another, after all. Yet this precautionary measure only served to draw further attention to the Kagomurasaki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>The people realized that a sacrifice had taken place, and they were outraged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>On top of the panic that was already present from the disease, things had now reached a boiling point. There was no quelling the crowds anymore. They were out for blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>And naturally, much of this outrage was directed squarely at the twins.</td>
