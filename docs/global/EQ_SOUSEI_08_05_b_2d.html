<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I've got you now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>An illusion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's not always brute strength alone that wins the day...though it can certainly help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, dear. That looked rather painful. I think you may have overdone it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh? No, there's no way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I-I mean, good! That should teach him not to mess with me anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Humans are quite resilient, anyway. I'm sure he'll be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Urgh... I'm not dead yet, at least...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ah, sorry, but I'll be taking that gun from you now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...A wise move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Look, I admit it, okay? I lost. I forfeit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Good boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Permit me to ask you something, though...Emmel, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes, that's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well... I understand that you want to save as many people as possible for your brother's sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But it seems as though you've elected to part from his side and fight for his ideals without him. Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What? Uhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>He was chosen by the Infinite Serpent, was he not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You should've just let him fight his own battles. Let him do things his own way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Let him try to save everything and everyone, if that's what he wants to do. They're his ideals, not yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>All you needed to do was stand by his side, and be there for him if he required your aid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So why have you been going out of your way for his sake, to the point of self-sacrifice, rather than striving to rejoin him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...Because I want to give him a future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>As I told Shahel, I don't have much time left in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And I don't want to see my brother get hurt on my behalf anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Even putting all that aside, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I can tell that the Alchemy my brother uses is extraordinarily dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The incredible things that Alchemy can do just don't make sense when you take into consideration how little magil they consume.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>When he uses it, it feels like something frightening and forbidden, as if he's forcibly summoning things into this world which should never be called upon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I can tell that only a single, small misstep could lead to his complete and utter devastation—or someone else's, for that matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yet despite knowing these dangers himself—better than anyone, I imagine—he has never once hesitated to use those powers. To him, if he can save others from distress, it's all worth it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So you're not trying to save everyone on his behalf after all; you're just setting the stage so he no longer has to use Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The gap in devotion between us is cavernous indeed. I suppose the loyalty of a discarded child to his adoptive father is but a farce when compared with the bonds of true family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>A...discarded child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Well... Uh, never mind that part.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>All right, Ignacio. You've said your piece. Now it's time to get down to business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Let's see how loyal you are to your dear sister. You know how to use this gun, right? Right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I have no intention of telling you anything about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Despite the position you're in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I belong to the Infinite Serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But you're also my brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes, I suppose I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>So come on! Brother it up! Teeeeach uuuus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Emmel? A little help? My sister is scaring me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Well... Now you're scaring me, too! Please don't look at me like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm going to stop Father. I once promised him I would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So that, too, is his will, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Won't you please help us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well, I...suppose I don't have much choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That's not a very encouraging reply.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You know, for how frail you look, you can be quite imposing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I've been hearing that sort of thing a lot lately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Speaking of, where's Quence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>He's a bit...tied up at the moment, back in his quarters at the castl—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hey. Are you done convincing him to help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Yes, I do believe we just crossed that bridge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You all give me such a headache...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>See, I told you you'd regret leaving me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...I don't like you, you know. I didn't like you before, but now I really, really don't like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hmph. The feeling's mutual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Um, I do believe the fight is over. There's no need to continue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>We're not fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I wouldn't waste my energy fighting with him. He's not worth it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>All right. If you say so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Come on, then, let's go. It's time to challenge the Cursed Beast of Pride once more!</td>
