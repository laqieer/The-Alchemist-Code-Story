<td>I see. So your resolve, then, is to inherit everything they were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>That's correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wonderful. If anything should reaffirm my convictions, that would be it. You are indeed a man fully worthy of my trust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Pardon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We've divulged so much in such short order, it would be foolish of us to expect you to immediately accept and internalize it. These things take time, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And yet, you are putting forth a genuine effort to listen, to understand, and to empathize with our plight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Those are the markings of a truly trustworthy ally. And I do believe I am not alone in recognizing this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I think we are all more than pleased to accept you into the fold. Thank you, Logi, for your consideration and your support.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No, thank you, Amane. I pledge, with unwavering resolution, that I will bring peace back to Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, you're sure nothin' if not earnest, Logi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Perhaps you could learn a thing or two from him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hey, I'm plenty earnest too, thankyouverymuch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You certainly do have...virtues all your own, I'll give you that. I thank you for being here as well, Edgar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So your motivation here is to help restore the way of life these people have lost? That's as Logi a sentiment as I've ever heard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You've always had a soft spot for such things. I seem to recall a certain promise about you, me, and Dias enjoying my stew again someday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Like Celis always said, "Those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Clearly, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Heh. I guess you got me there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>With your arrival, the tides truly have changed here. We can finally bring back Kagutsuchi and restore Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's no longer a hopeless endeavor. So tell me, Logi, are you committed to learning and mastering the sacred art of Kagutsuchi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You can count on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>How is he to do that, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The first step is to restore Mikaboshi to its original, complete state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh, is that...Mikaboshi? What are you going to—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Mikaboshi's consciousness presently resides within me. I will now transfer it to this stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Still not enough? I must...concentrate. I must...dive...deeper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ah! What is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's like I'm losing a portion of myself I've grown very attached to. But, no! This is no time for empty sentiment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I must say farewell here, as much as it pains me to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Return, Mikaboshi, to where you belong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>But even after you've returned, Mikaboshi...let's continue to walk together. This is not your journey or mine, but ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Let us take the first steps toward saving Wadatsumi, hand in hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Are you sure that's what you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I know it's what's best for Wadatsumi, but choosing this path may cost you more than you've ever lost before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Are you still willing to take my hand, despite all the risks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Absolutely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Doing so will fulfill not only the wishes of all the people of this land...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...but my wishes as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Thank you, Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What... What just happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm truly grateful to you, Amane. I've become whole again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No thanks are needed. This is all for the sake of Wadatsumi and the wellbeing of its people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Besides, I'd do anything for a friend. And you are, unequivocally, a true friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Amane? Who are you speaking—? Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Who in the...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wha— Wh-who was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>There we have it. We've successfully restored one of the Sacred Three of Wadatsumi, the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi, to its rightful state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Captains Ugachi and Jubei, may I entrust you to keep things under control in our absence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Not a problem. You just focus on attaining Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>This isn't the first time I've had to wait on you, and I don't like it one bit, so get moving already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You know what needs to be done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Let's do this, then, Logi. We must seek out the lost sacred art of Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Of course. In the name of restoring peace to Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I will make certain to master that art!</td>
</tr>
