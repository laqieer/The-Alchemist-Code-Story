<td>So, you dismiss me as a mere child? Hmph, bad luck. It's just my face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I can't believe the Greed Dike Inquisition was held in the Shiba Senko's stronghold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It means that they share the same goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Indeed. The Shiba Senko and Greed Dike are in cahoots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>F-filthy heathens!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I am the General of the Greed Dike Army!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>My actions are the will of Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>From where I stand, that makes you the heathens!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Do you really think we will tolerate treason against this great nation?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Greed Dike must take responsibility for its crimes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Otherwise, we cannot call ourselves just!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Not all of Greed Dike is against us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The youth of the next generation will play a central role in this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Starting with me. As general, I am a symbol of the new Greed Dike...albeit in name only.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Th-that's right! What could you possibly do with just a name?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Names are often what inspire people the most.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It doesn't matter if I'm just a name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It will allow me to rally people to my cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The world doesn't rule the people; the people create the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Their suffering, sorrow, ire, joy... These burdens overlap, and when they connect...that is how the world of humans is made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I—no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We will bring peace to this world together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We will restore order to Wadatsumi and shape Greed Dike anew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What could a silly little girl possibly hope to achieve?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We are young, ambitious, noble warriors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We won't go home until we complete our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You should know that by now. You are an adult, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Take them away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Our plot was to dominate the world using demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Humans cannot hope to defeat them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That's why your plan was insane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Insane, you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We have already—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ngh... Ungh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wh-where did that come from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Th-this is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wh-what—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Fortuitous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Most fortuitous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Truly splendid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Ah! Wh-wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Th-the Discarnate Power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I must apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>All I have done is create corpses; how dreadfully uninspiring of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>To borrow the words of my previous host...'twas a despicable, disgusting thing to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>There is little I can do about it in this state, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Y-you should have been destroyed when Jin was killed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That is precisely why I need time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>He did something very troublesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>If only I had Yomi's body, brimming as it was with corruption. I would not have had to take such indirect methods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I-indirect...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You did so well. My power was purged in its entirety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I had to sleep within Jin's corpse and amass corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It was terribly, terribly dull.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>My connection to my host was severed in the previous battle during which I began to manifest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I had to earn my keep after that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Both the Shiba Senko and Greed Dike worked so very hard to obtain me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>They did all they could to make me manifest—even that old Kagomurasaki codger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I devoured him as a reward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>He was delicious. Oh, so delectable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>G-give me...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You have a duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Wh-what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The first demon to ever lie with a human was a woman. This makes it easier for women to carry the Discarnate Power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hence why the Kagomurasaki ruled that only men who were direct descendants could become the head of the clan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Wh-what does that have to do with anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>The head of the clan must stand on the front line of the battlefield, must he not? In doing so, he would be exposed to corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Should a woman carrying the Discarnate Power become the head of the clan, she would continue to amass corruption...quickening my delivery into this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Ygh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The meaning behind that rule faded over time, until it was forgotten entirely. Then, a little girl became clan leader. Quite the oversight, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Well...one could say that it is thanks to that mishap that I am here today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I was just thinking about how I could possibly thank you for that, Yomi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Nnnnnngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Give...me...back...my...brother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I thought you might say that, so I saved some for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Jin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I saved...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>The last bite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Wh-wha...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>H-he's...b-biting...Jin?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Sccchhlllurrrkk! Sssscccchhhhhhlllluuurrrrrkkkkk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Glllrrrp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>That was so very delicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Aggghhh... Aaaaarrrrrggghhhh! J-J-Jin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Mmmmmmmm... I drained his Chakra as I sucked the marrow from his bones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Oh, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Delectable! Divine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Ah...ah...ah...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>So, Yomi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>What is it that I should give back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Uwaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh! Aaaaaaarrrrrrrgggggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Y-Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Yomi, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>How c-could...? How could...?! How could you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Oooh, I found it! I found it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Found...what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I thought it might start to show itself if you were to get a little riled up, see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Oh, yes! Yes, indeed! The Mikaboshi is...right here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Nnnngghh... Aaaaarrrrrrggghhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I-it took the Mikaboshi from Yomi and...swallowed it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Th-this...is...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Nnnghh... Aaaaaarrrrrrgggghhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>You went to all the trouble of bringing me both siblings on a silver platter, just as I desired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Fools. Haha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Kagutsuchi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Kiraboshi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Ggrrrrrrroooooooooggggggghhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>N-no way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Don't tell me that Kagutsuchi can't affect the Mikaboshi anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Well, then. Let us go. Away, away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Catch me if you can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Wh-what are you planning?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Consumed with the desire for vengeance, sullied by disgrace... Once all of your hatred and grief comes to a boil...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>I will devour the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Oh, ecstasy! Rapture!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Catch me if you can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I will be waiting for you...at Onigashima—the Island of Demons.</td>
