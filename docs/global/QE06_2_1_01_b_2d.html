<td>The damage is quite extensive…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We may have avoided total destruction… but our headquarters, Castle Aquila Rubrum, is half destroyed. And the corps members who faced the multiple Discarnate Powers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We lost...nearly half of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>…Sheesh. We sent them on a death mission, huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>How can you be so nonchalant at a time like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…I'm just trying to make sense of it all. We can't give up now--that's for sure…and besides, they've taken Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...There are more important things to consider right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Would you be able to say the same thing if Azami were kidnapped?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A captain who can't protect his squad...is beyond pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>…I know now's not the time to be wallowing in self-pity, but I'm feeling beaten down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Being depressed won't change anything! We need to think about our next move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>…There are too many unknowns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>For one, why did the Discarnate Power kidnap Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It doesn't make sense for her to be their target. Furthermore...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You both saw it, didn't you? Her power… What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes, I remember…but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Beast Art Evocations Book Two - Tigris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I don't recall ever teaching her that technique.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Blade Fox members are allowed a limited amount of chakra to combat demons...but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hers was a different kind of power. Did you teach her that, Tanosuke?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>…Nope, can't say it was me. But...hang on. I just realized something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What if that strange power was the reason the demons took Amane…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>…!?</td>
