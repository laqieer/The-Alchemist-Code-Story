<td>Hmhmhm... What's wrong, dearie? I thought you were going to prove your love of Shayna to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Nnrgh! Who the hell do you think you are?!</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>If you claim to be a fan of a shining star like Shayna, you had better be possessed of both strength and beauty, just as I am!</td>

<td>The most important qualities in a fan are strength and beauty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>And the purpose of these Fan Club Events is to both heighten those qualities and contest them! Are you prepared?</td>

<td>007</td>
<td>H-hold on a moment! This is the first I'm hearing of such an objective!</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>She's right! Merchandise and length of membership have nothing to do with being a fan!</td>

<td>Wh-what?! You guys actually agree with her?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Tch! Just because you're a Fan Club veteran, doesn't make you better than us! I've had enough of you acting all high and mighty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The fact that you've fought with Shayna herself puts you out of bounds of the fandom, for starters! It's downright unfair, that's what it is! You sly fox!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What's going on over there? I had better nip this in the bud!</td>
