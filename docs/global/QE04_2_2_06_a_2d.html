<td>Wait, Alia. Are you telling me that Seida had the power to neutralize a Sacred Stone within her body?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>After all, she was my granddaughter! Kakkakka!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Is it possible for one who is not a Sprite to carry such a burden?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>She was a strong child. She bore the power of the Sacred Stone, yet did not allow herself to bend to that power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It may be fair to say it was possible because it was Seida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But Seida is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes. She is gone now. However, Seida had a sister. You must crush that child's eyes and use her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>As of now, excluding myself, she is the only one left of the people of Alize. She is also the last living person who carries the power of the wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The rest of them are all gone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>She, too, has a resistance to the power of the wind, but it is not strong as Seida's power was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That is why you must crush her eyes and prevent any blight from entering her body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>As a substitute for the Temple, she must maintain the purity of her body to serve as a vessel for the Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Alia...are you speaking in earnest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>blight enters from the eyes. To remain pure, shut them. It's an old lore that has been passed down in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...To be honest, I never expected a day would come when I'd have to rely on those ancient words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...Alia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This is the fate that we, the people of Alize, must carry. Neglecting our traditions would be the same as denying the history of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You must tell her about this heavy burden she has inherited from ancient generations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Tell her that she must not blame our traditions, our history, or our people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If she is to blame anyone, it should be this old decrepit! I believe that someday she will understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You intend to shoulder everything on your own. Where is the justice in that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I entrust all the land of Alia to you. Furthermore, in preparation for when the power of wind returns, I also entrust the Wind Temple...and my granddaughter...to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Have you truly accepted this fate?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Kakkakka! I am certain you would do the same if you were in my position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...Why do you entrust this all to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Voda is both clever and strong, but she tends to avoid the company of others. This burden would be much too heavy on her shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Tehre is still young.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>He's just taken on the role of Earth Sprite. It's too early for him to shoulder this burden. That's why I entrust it to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Alia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm sorry for burdening you with this. I'll understand if you bear a grudge against me as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>And you're certain your resolve won't change?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Sorry, my friend, but I'm a stubborn old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's true... The moon is beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Right? What I wouldn't give to share a toast with you on a night like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Once my role here is over, and I make my way to wherever you are...we'll share the grandest of toasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You know I'm not a drinker, but on that day...we'll drink together until the sun rises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Kaaakkakaka! Take as long as you can before joining me! I won't forgive you if you come too early!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I promise...not a promise between Sprites, but between men!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I will carry on your resolve and protect the future of Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Kakkakkakk. What a wonderful night. Fuu, it's time now. Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...Do you have any last words?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>In fact, I think I spoke too much. Be well, Fuu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Land of Saga, people of Saga! Peace and prosperity for generations! I leave the future of Saga in your hands, Fuu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I swear on this moon that I will fulfill my promise to you! Farewell, Alia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...Hyaaaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
