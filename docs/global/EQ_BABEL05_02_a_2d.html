<td>003</td>
<td>If I just did my best, if I just worked harder than anyone else... As a child...I really thought that all my effort would be enough.</td>

<td>When we were children...before I became aware of things, our parents split up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I went with my father and my older brother went with my mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I don't really remember my mother's face, but I remember meeting her just once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I have never forgotten what she said to me then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You have a brother who is aiming to become an excellent alchemist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm sure he will become a great Paladin and a wonderful alchemist. He will be a brother that will make you proud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You must do your best to be a sister that can make him just as proud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>When I think back on it, I'm not sure if she said that out of some sort of misplaced parental affection, or if she was just being polite, or what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Then she died, so I guess I'll never know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I've since heard that my brother quit the Holy Guard and has given up on being an alchemist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Still... I've never been able to shake her words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I don't even know his name, or his face, let alone where he might be now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>And yet, I feel like I've been waiting for him my entire life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'll be back soon, Father.</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>[Thank you so much for your continued patronage.]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>

<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>[As such, I regret to inform you that the shop will be closing indefinitely. Signed, Albea.]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I have a place to return to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>My father, who taught me all that I know as a mechanic...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Was a stubborn, old-fashioned man who would never wear this mask of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>He always saw me as a child, no matter how much I grew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yet, at the very end, he finally recognized me as my own person. It took him that long, even though I'd been filling more shop requests than him for quite some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It was the smoke and the vapors, the byproducts of our work, that finally did him in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>He left me this workshop, filled with all the things he made...and the empty space that used to be his to work in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Neither of us were particularly good at organizing things, and the mess just seems to be getting more and more unmanageable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>He used to say that it was his dream to make machines do it all for him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>He told me that he had no regrets about leaving the workshop to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>In the end, he finally let me go out into the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I've made us a home, brother. You have a place to come back to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If I don't know anything about my brother, I won't be able to bring him home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I bet he's just as stubborn as I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Th-that was such a moving story! Unnnghhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Don't cry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Bleugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Don't throw up on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>My little brother is the only family I have, too! I think I know how you feel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So you used to run a shop, huh? I guess that explains all this stuff you're carrying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It might come in handy at some point. I've been told that the outside world can be a dangerous place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I brought everything I could get my hands on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That's great! There's no point wasting time on packing, after all. You've just gotta hurl everything within arm's reach into your suitcase and call it a day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Exactly. It's important to be prepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yup! You got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Sounds like you two have a lot in common.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Heheh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I decided that I'm not going home without my brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I want to ask him why he gave up on being an alchemist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You need to learn the workings of a machine in order to understand the error message.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Maybe I need to learn Alchemy in order to understand my brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That was what I thought, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Slothstein Research Laboratory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You got turned away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes, but I overheard the researchers talking about how they recently discovered the ruins of an ancient civilization of Babel that have some connection to Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The people who went to investigate them disappeared, so they were warned to stay away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>And yet here you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You've got to be thorough when you're debugging.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Amazing! I see that eavesdropping on unsuspecting researchers is a piece of cake for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Well, it's not that easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Wow. A miniature, winged, flyable mecha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Whoa! Incredible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It's not at all difficult to make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>All right! All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Wh-what is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>S-so do you think I could make one, too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I didn't know girls liked this kind of stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Of course we do, you dummy! This is so freaking cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Y-you really think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>All right, then. All we need are the blueprints and the necessary materials.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Blueprints?! Lemme see, lemme see! I wanna try!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>O-okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Aww... I can't do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Heheh. You're a strange one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Why don't we just make do with the one that's already made?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Well, the place is pretty well-guarded. There's a limit to how much information we can gather just by eavesdropping.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>If someone were to tell you everything you wanted to know about Alchemy, would you back off the ruins?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What connection do you have with these ruins?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I am not obligated to answer that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Then there's no reason for me to leave, is there? I won't be making any promises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You're kinda a brat, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Excuse me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Oho!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>There are some lines you shouldn't cross.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Look who's talking! I feel like you just crossed exactly such a line!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Which one would that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Wh-which one...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Gimme a break! You've been fussing with your hair the whole time we've been talking. You're such an obnoxious brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>That's it! That's the line, right there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Quit whining alreadyâ€”and keep your voice down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Ugh! You are so annoying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>By the way, do you bathe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Wh-what?! What did you just... What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I'm not saying you smell bad or anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Y-you...! I... I don't have to put up with this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Calm your boots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>That's it! I'm... I'm going by myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Aww... Don't be like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Get out of the way, Mira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Hold on a sec. You can't touch me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>M-my hand... It went right through you! Wh-what's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>What the hell?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>We're gonna make a trade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Well... Now that you mention it, there is something I want to look into. I guess I can tag along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>No way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Yes way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Howdy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Oh! Mister Will, what a pleasant surprise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Urgh. I can't believe they actually call him Mister Will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I know, right? It's gross! Bleurgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Heheh, it sure is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>You can call me Mister Will, too, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Dream on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>What can we do for you today, Mister Will?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Just a spot of research. Mind if I come in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Of course not! We are forever in your debt afterâ€”well, you know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Let's talk about that some other time, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>But of course! Please, take as long as you need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I can't believe this. They turned me away without listening to a word I had to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>It always helps to have people in your debt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>What was that all about, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Everyone has a few things in their past they'd rather not talk about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>That researcher really seemed devoted to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>You know what they say. All the people of the world are one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>That doesn't answer my question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Well, that would be because I have no intention of answering you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Hmph. What is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Don't tell me you've never seen a deck of cards before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Of course I have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>There are fifty-two cards in a deck, divided into four different suits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I just figured that you probably never had any friends to play games like this with, given that all you seem to do is fiddle around with your machines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Are you... Are you making fun of me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I sure am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Hahahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Well, I'm totally clueless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Did you say they're a dock of cards?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>That's D-E, not D-O.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Oh, a dork of caddies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Where did the R come from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Doorknob caddies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>How is it getting longer? Are you doing this on purpose?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Anyway, like I was saying... There are fifty-two cards in a deck, which is divided into four different suits...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>So you cut them to play, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Don't cut them! You're not meant to cut them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Cut means shuffle, Mira. You mix them up like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Let's play a round of Old Maid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Aren't you bored? You're stuck in this stuffy old library, waiting for your lecture on Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Oh, go on, then. Hurry up and deal them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>So everyone has to hold the cards, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Will you play, too, Mira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>No, I think I'll pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Then it's just the t-two of us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>I can't touch things, remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>W-well, I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>I will begin by explaining the Alchemy of Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>You're starting now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Open that textbook to page one hundred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>I can't be playing cards if I have to look at the book!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Put your pairs off to the side, chop-chop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Ah! W-wait! I can'tâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>This country considers efficiency above all else. Dwelling on efficiency, however, can easily become laziness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Ooh, getting straight to the point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Through the application of Alchemy, we have advanced our steam engines; our machines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Not only that, but we have used Alchemy to enslave Demons and put them to work so that we may develop our island home at a faster rate. Their assistance is considered a necessity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>D-Demons...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Hey, it's your turn. Draw a card.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Urgh, fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>These Demons are said to be an ancient weapon, created in secrecy using extreme and ancient Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>According to history, as recorded by the Holy Order, these Demons instantaneously reduced the ancient civilization of Babel to ashes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Should they become the enemy of mankind once more, only Alchemy could stop them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Well, perhaps not even Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>I've never seen anything like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Well, it's kept behind closed doors, of course. Top secret, and all thatâ€”with the full approval of the Holy Guard to back it, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>The Demons have been made so that they will lose their powers the moment they leave the country. That way, they can't infringe upon the Order's precious Magna Code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>This is how Slothstein has made use of Alchemy for the purpose of its own efficiency, and thus made incredible progress as a society.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Hooray for the use of destructive weapons to achieve a world that's both safe and secure... I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Now do you understand why you weren't allowed in here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Heh! I win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>You can keep it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>The joker. Consider it a gift.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>In any case, that's the nature of Alchemy itself. There have always been those who would use it for their selfish purposes, bringing untold calamities upon the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>This is why it is treated as a taboo art, to be used only by the Holy Order, who adhere strictly to what is known as the Alchemist Code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>(Alchemy was first created in order to defeat the Cursed Beasts.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>(However, the art has changed together with the flow of time.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>(It has been a menace to humanity, a tool used to destroy whole civilizations.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>(Why is that?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>My brother was in the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Good man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>He was poached by the Holy Guard shortly after joining the Wratharis army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>He was called a genius alchemist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>A genius... Well, a genius ex-alchemist, who was born in Slothstein and is living in Wratharis. I feel like there should be someone in the field who knows about him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Would you mind asking around the laboratory for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Pfft.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Do I really look like the do-gooder type to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>Not really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>I've already finished my research. I even gave you a lecture as a bonus. I think I've done more than enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>If you keep pushing, you'll end up getting yourself killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Oh, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>I'm serious. I'm warning you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>Who's going to kill me, hm? You? Or someone else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Let me guess... It's for my own good?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>That's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Then it seems I have nothing to lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>I'm going to go and have a look around for myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>Pursue Alchemy all you like. It's not going to get you anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>I'm not going to give up just because it's dangerous. I'm made of tougher stuff than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Even if I were afraid of being killed, and I quit while I was ahead and went back to my shop...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>I'd...just be alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>I... I don't want to be alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>Umf... There.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>Huh? What're you doing on the ground?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>Speed Gear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>What's wrong with you? Why do you keep pressing the buttons on your shoes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>Goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>Whoa! Holy...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>Wow! That's crazy fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>I guess we'll just have to follow her on foot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>Why are we following her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>Just 'cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>I thought you weren't the do-gooder type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>Did you lose sight of her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>Yeah. A while ago now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>Hanging back and waiting to attack us until we reached a deserted area... You really know your stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>Those who approach the Cursed Beasts must be removed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240</td>
<td>Just so you know, that girl who ran away doesn't know anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>241</td>
<td>I'm the only one who knows anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>242</td>
<td>I'm also the only one with this stone... See?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>243</td>
<td>That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>244</td>
<td>We don't need more people crossing lines that shouldn't be crossed. I'm doing enough of that for everyone.</td>
