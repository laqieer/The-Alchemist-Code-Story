<td>003</td>
<td>This isn't your fault. Please, don't apologize.</td>

<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Forgive me. I can't even get you out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is all I can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This is...the dance of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>All I can do is pray for your safety and well-being. All I can do is infuse this dance with how I feel, and dedicate it to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Chihaya...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Get rid of Chihaya, Kuza.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We needed her to manipulate the people of Wadatsumi and to draw the Holy Guard here. She has outlived her usefulness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>She will simply vanish if you undo the Alchemy you did that keeps her in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>She will dissipate on her own. Why must I go out of my way to do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I must see your determination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>You do not yet have my complete confidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Kuza!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You were ordered to eliminate me, weren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No! Run, Chihaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's fine. I've died once already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Chihaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But please, as a parting gift... Tell me. Why do you work for Orion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>All those who live here know how much you've done for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So...why? Why are you doing this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What difference would it make even if I were to tell you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It makes all the difference to me. I want to know what is going through the mind of the one who takes my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Or are you telling me to die without knowing why? Like the people of Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I entrusted the fate of Wadatsumi to you. I believe I have the right to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Entrusted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>P-please...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Please... Save...Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You remember that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>How could I forget? I have faith in what lies deep within your heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I can see that you're trying to shoulder the burden all by yourself! Your commitment has even brought you to a place where you're playing the role of a villain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Aren't you fighting for the restoration of Wadatsumi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Can we not work together, hand in hand?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Why do you care so much about me? I'm nothing more than a deplorable villain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Because I am here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I never stopped praying for the sake of Wadatsumi. Even after my death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It was your hope, your desire, that answered my prayers. Even though you can't use Alchemy, it was you. Am I wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Somehow, it was Kuza who summoned me. Waginau then bound me to this world, so that they could use me as they saw fit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>What an unorthodox summoning... That explains why I couldn't sense any Alchemia from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>That summoning, distorted though it may be, shows how much you care for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>The fact that I am here is proof that you still haven't given up on Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Though I do find it vexing to be bound here against my will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Is such a miracle even—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Heh. Hahahah...hahahahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Kuza?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Was it really so foolish to try going on the offensive, once being on the defensive proved fruitless?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I saw you dance. It was breathtaking. It was as beautiful as the memories I have of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Every time I see you dance, I am reminded of what I must protect. Was I so wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Kuza...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I joined him to gain power. I waited patiently for an opportunity to avenge my home. I fought to put an end to the fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I did all this to seize peace through power so that Wadatsumi would never again come to ruin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>At the cost of the destruction of the other nations? Many innocent people will die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That's right. I am too weak to defeat Orion. So I'm spreading the flames of war⁠, flames that scorch even my beloved Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You're aware of this, and yet you still...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I am mired in this mess, and I cannot escape. I will not escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Wh-why? Why must...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What are you crying for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Because...this is all wrong. Why must we fight you, when all you want is to protect Wadatsumi? We share the same goal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Would Wadatsumi be saved if I stopped?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I... Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What about all those who have been sacrificed? What of all the time that has been dedicated to this so far?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>This is why you have ended up alone and misunderstood. Taking it all on alone like this...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Even if I stopped this right now...who could ever forgive all that I have done?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You're so much like Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>He's here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You are still the Kuza I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Do you have to fight against Kudan? Is it not possible for you to fight together as blood brothers, side by side?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>There are still things I must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Things I must do for him, as his older brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>K-Kuza?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I have a foolish plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Kuza!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>We're here for Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>There is nothing left for us to say to each other. I am not here to reason with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I understand. It is time for us to test our justices against each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Is the stronger one the righteous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>No... The stronger one is the older brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You're speaking nonsense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>We each have a justice that we represent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Then I need only win to prove that my justice is greater than yours. I won't lose to you, Kuza.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Heh. You've never defeated me before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Today is the day I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I'd like to see you try.</td>
</tr>
