<td>Hrgh...!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>He not only countered my attack, but even managed to attack as well?! In that single moment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>He somehow managed to deflect my attack...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>How can this be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ugh... I don't have time for this. You're in my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh? Are you admitting defeat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ha... Don't make me laugh. I don't know what kind of powers of darkness you have, but I have no intention of losing to the likes of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I simply have more important things to do than hang around here to fight this useless battle with you. I need to get to Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Northern Pride?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>After losing the Matter, we at least need a Sacred Stone to make it all worth while...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I must discuss this with Orion before it becomes a problem...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm saying it's none of your business!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>He's gone...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Orion in Northern Pride...? He's making his move on the Alchemy of Power?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Northern Pride: Headquarters of the Holy Guard</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Suzuka, watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No, he's—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Behind me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Kanon, are you alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Y-yes... You're so fast...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>To be able to deflect my blade under such circumstances... Well done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>However, it's time to put an end to this. Prepare for your demise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So this is the skill that defeated both Captain Monzein and Captain Yauras!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What? Those two... They were defeated by these Templars?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Not just those two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>According to my information, we have also taken care of the ones called Othima and Seida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Captain Othima...?! A-and Captain Seida...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So I hear. Perhaps that information has not reached you yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Of the core members of the Holy Guard, only two remain: Captain Kagura of the 5th Regiment and the Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That is all that is left of this world's "absolute justice."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Rrgh! Huzzaaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Mistress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Such tremendous fighting spirit...but no matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ack...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You cannot hope to defeat me with vigor alone, especially when you've left so many openings for my blade to finish you off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>U-ughh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No! Mistress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ack...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Were you not listening to what I just said? Now you're just being obtuse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wait... That fighting spirit... She was aiming for...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I won't let you do this! Even if it costs me my life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Strange... You are not one of the Holy Guard. In which case, why are you willing to go so far to protect them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Why? Kanon is a friend—a one in a million friend who reaffirmed the value of my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Spica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>In other words, these people showed you the reason for your existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I believe I understand. You have come clad in your Final Battle Armament to pay your debt of gratitude to these people for what they have done for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...! You... You know of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Final Battle Armament...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>This armament was created by the Shadow Messiah, the organization created by Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The Final Battle Armament is a special set of armor worn by Shadow Messiah members when they plan to take part in a battle they expect to possibly lose their life in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>In other words, she has come with the resolution to die here if needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What?! Spica... I had no idea that you'd come here with that in mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Until I met Kanon, my life had one driving force—revenge for Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>After crossing swords with Kanon, Chloe, and the others... I couldn't fulfill it, because I realized that wasn't a cause worth dedicating my life to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Spica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Everything that had given my life meaning disappeared in that moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>At the very least, I thought I could find value in it by sacrificing myself on Ramproad Mountain to suppress the eruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>If I'm honest...I was hoping to die then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>However, I was saved by the very people I considered my enemies, the knights of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Seeing Kanon genuinely hope for my survival... It opened a door in my heart that I thought would always be closed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>She helped me find the strength to live again. That I am even here at all is in itself thanks to Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It's only natural that I would be willing to lay down my life for the one who saved it to begin with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Spica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>To meet someone of the Shadow Messiah in a place like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I shall give you one chance. If you leave this battle, I will allow you to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What...? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I must decline your generous offer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Spica?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>If I were to abandon my friends now in their time of need, the value of my life would disappear again. I will fight you. I will protect them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I see. In that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I pity you, but I will lose no sleep over your death. Goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Hm. How fortuitous to be welcomed back by so many familiar faces just when I finally decide to pop back for a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Who...? Do you mean to tell me that you have already forgotten the sound of my voice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I-impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Huh...?! Wh-whoa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Zehn, what are you thinking? Why are you attacking Spica like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Lord...Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
