<td>Letitia!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes, what is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why did you bring that squirt along with us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It would have been cruel of us to leave her behind there, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So, why not just take her home?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Weren't you listening? She's a war orphan as well; all the more reason for us to take her into our care. Right, Mia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Y-yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oi, squirt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh? Y-yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You must be living with someone, right? Like your grandparents or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You've got a place to go back to, don't you?! What if we take you back, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But...if I went back to my grandparents', I'd only be a bother to them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A home is a still a home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ila, what are you getting so mad about? She can just stay with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I don't care if she stays here, either! I just hate the fact that she has somewhere to go back to, but she won't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ila, Silma, Spica...from this day forth, Mia is a part of our family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I leave her in your charge. Take good care of her. Hehe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Spica, what do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What? Me? I don't know...but knowing Letitia, she's probably got some scheme up her sleeve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Gah. Still, I don't like this at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Letitia, I'm against letting this girl join the Shadow Messiah, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Don't worry. She won't be joining us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Then whyâ€”?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>To protect her, for the time being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If that's all, then I'll leave it be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Lord Zahar, I will begin reviewing the research notes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Good. Begin as soon as possible. The research may have other applications besides creating the Sacred Darkstone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Other applications?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh, this is unexpected. Heh heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Breaking new ground in alchemy... A "contract with the darkness."</td>
