<td>Hey, Kamui? Do you remember this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We used to play together until dark at the base of this great tree when we were little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Isidore was always the one who came to pick us up so we could all go home together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yeah, I remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Back then, I never expected things to turn out like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Malta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Kamui...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We used to spend hours here, talking together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Do you remember? We promised that we'd travel the outside world together someday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Then Isidore's father died, and I became the druidic priestess, so we never got that chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah, I remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If I were to say I wanted to leave the village right now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Would you take me away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We could find a land more luscious and green than here, where there are no restrictions or duties, and we can live together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We could build a house, tailor some clothes, hunt... We would be free to choose how to live on our own terms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I think a child of ours would be very much like Hisham.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Maybe some siblings would be nice, too! So we should have two kidsâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Malta...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That can never be. I am now the Protector of Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I simply cannot abandon the duty given to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I...yes. I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You're just as stubborn as ever. Always shouldering the burden on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's how you are even now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I know your commitment to your duties as Protector, and that the civil war continues to spill a river of blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I just want to ask you: why must it be you who is burdened with these troubles?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I understand what you are trying to say, but...as long as there is something I can do to help...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You're fine with taking the brunt of the hardship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I know it's a naive way of thinking, but I feel better if I am the one hurt, rather than others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No, Kamui, that is not naivete. That is called kindness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I guess that little Kamui I remember is all grown up now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's right... Things can't stay as they were. Those innocent days of our childhood when we could laugh so free of care are gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Malta...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We should head back home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yup! This was a refreshing change of scenery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ah, um, if you say so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Let's go home, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>As you wish.</td>
