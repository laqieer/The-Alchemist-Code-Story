<td>I've finished analyzing the magic innate to the shield. It's like the king said, this shield could be our saving grace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It could be, but I fear it won't be so easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Not even with your skill?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We're not just dealing with the innate magic that resides within this shield. We'll also have to add the Anti-Curse magic to deal with Leviathan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's going to hard to get both of those to work harmoniously within one shield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What do you think? Should we forget about the upgrades? Just restore it to its original function?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No, I fear that won't be enough... But there's one thing we haven't tried yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Do you think it'll work if we make it a pair? Two weapons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So splitting one function across two different objects? Essentially the opposite of Libra, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's still rather difficult, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But you can do it, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, I'll try to live up to your expectations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Is it alright to use 'that' to make up for the materials we're lacking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, we did bring it along for this kind of situation. In case the Gears of Judgement got damaged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Then I'll get started. Nimul, what wi—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Excuse me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...It's no problem that you're here, but please don't shout like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I nearly spilled all of this boiling water...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>M-my sincerest apologies! But this is an emergency!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The airship is being chased by Leviathan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Is it true, Your Highness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It is. My own knights have reported that Adaleigh took Andechs along to retrieve the Ira Belt warship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...And on the way, they ran into Leviathan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It appears that they have distanced themselves from the capital and are instead headed for the border. Isn't that right, Daphne?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Daphne?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, um, it's nothing! It's just like you said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We wanted to go and rescue them, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...We've nearly finished repairing the shield, but we still need a bit more time. Not to mention, we're still lacking a method to handle Leviathan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If we follow them without an effective plan, we might all perish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You can't be saying... Are you telling us to abandon them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Not in the slightest. We'll head there the second the shield is ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Will we make it in time? The border is still quite a distance away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We might be able to make it if it's just us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh! You want to use Space-Time Manipulation? I think I could manage a one way trip to the Libra, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I only have enough magil to take along four, maaaybe five people at best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>And I'm going to guess and say that me and Nyx are going to be pretty darn useless for a whole day afterwards... You still want to go for it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>These are dire straits. The ends will justify the means. As for who else will come along—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...You want me to go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It seems your magil is deeply intertwined with that of the shield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>In other words, you're the only one who can draw out its true power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You're the only one who can strip the Cursed Beast of its sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>My chest feels so tight, I can't breathe. It's like I'm suffocating. They want me to fulfill such an important role? Me...? But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Understood! I'll come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It seems you've settled on a plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Then let us move to make it a reality. Nimul, I'm counting on you to fix that shield as fast as you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The Purple Flame Knights will prepare the fleet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Finally, we can seize the opportunity to sever the bond between Leviathan and our people. We can not falter here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It's a race against the clock. We've got to get this shield repaired in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Mira, you help Daphne prepare for the jump. Eulalia will assist too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Gotcha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Leave it to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What?! That sound came from Nicaea's room!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Is Emmel okay—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Lady Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What is it? Does it hurt somewhere?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>No, I'm all right. I was just wondering if you could use your power to help me up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That'll be difficult. You see, your body doesn't have enough magil to survive at the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It's not the same as healing your wounds. This can only be healed with time and rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ah, I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>This won't do... I thought I'd be able to help Daphne and Imnus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I think you have already helped us a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Not just Daphne and Imnus, you saved my brother's life too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>That's why you should take the time to rest now. You can leave the rest to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Heh, you're really too kind, Lady Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Not at all—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Huh?! What's happening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>An intruder climbed through the window! Lady Nicaea, get behind me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>—Aah, I've found you. The shield has shattered, and the beast has broken its chains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>So the sacred beast is the only thing left in our way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Ah, the shrine maiden from the other world... You will not interfere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>This is the guy who was leading the Ira Belt forces?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Lady Emmel! Run! It's me that he's after!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I refuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Lady Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Countless of people would mourn your death. I'm sure Imnus would be devastated too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I've had enough of that kind of sadness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I've seen enough people who lose sight of everything after a loss...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>So I want you to live, to be happy. That's what all of us want from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>So I will definitely protect you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Fools!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Wishes without the strength to back them up, ideals without resolve, in the end they are no more than pipe dreams!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Oh my, you blocked my attack? Impressive, but this is where the story ends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I will not be hindered! Stand in my way and you shall be the first one I cut down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I didn't expect to see this to be the first thing I saw after finishing up in the forge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Yna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I will take care of this! Take the princess and run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>You will not stand in my— You. You, are you one of the serpents?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>The scent of distorted magil is unmistakable. Did you meet that woman?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Well, I suppose it doesn't matter. Regardless of who you are, you'll burn all the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>...Anger is often likened to flames. I can see that that's your power to wield as a Fallen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>But a blacksmith is forged in the flames! When it comes to handling fire, I know all the tricks—!</td>
