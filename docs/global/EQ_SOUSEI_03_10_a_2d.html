<td>Oh, lucky! It seems like magil is only inhibited within that facility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We should be able to use Space-Time Manipulation now. We'll be able to fight, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It seems likely that was some kind of containment facility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My Spiritbonding also seems to be available to me now. However, we ought to prepare countermeasures in case we find ourselves in such circumstances again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Sure, but we have more pressing issues to be concerned with at the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Namely, whether or not there is a hidden entrance here after all, or if it's really just a wall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ouch. Where's the faith? Sure, it looks like a wall, but check this out... It moves. See?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Is this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's real dark in here. Watch your footing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>These are the same mechanisms as those inside the clocktower...? Minario, how can this be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...This is one of the elements that allows Redington to stay airborne, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>However, unlike the clocktower's propulsion unit, this is more of a failsafe mechanism...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But I've used it as my own personal hideout ever since I was a kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I used to come here whenever things didn't go my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So what you're saying is that it's safe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yeah, it should be. Even my father doesn't know I have a history of sneaking into this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That you brought us here means you believe that the mayor really...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yeah... He's almost certainly in league with Icona.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'll bet they're holed up in the clocktower right now, plotting how to handle the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Now that they've gone and made us awaken it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Speaking of, what's going on with Belphegor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Exactly! If it goes on a rampage, there'll be chaos!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The answer to that lies in this footage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Is this...image being projected through to us...? But what exactly...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Isn't that...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Is that Belphegor seated atop a vein?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It certainly looks that way. This is the last of what I was able to get my hands on using the connections I have as a Special Detective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Everyone in the vicinity was swallowed up by the corruption. There were no survivors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>How awful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This... Icona did this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>And yet the mayor thinks they can control this somehow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If so, then it's a false dream. The sheer volume of all this sinful magil... Even that of the Luxuria Belt Region doesn't compare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>How could anyone without the gift of Spiritbonding or Anti-Curse protection even get close?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No... If we go by the mayor's announcement, they may not need to get close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>How could that be possible? Do they have some way to handle that Cursed Beast without coming into contact with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>At the very least, they seem to think they do. Of course, the official announcement was a little light on the details...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>So what you're saying is that we'd have to confront them directly if we want to know more, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I should have known you'd be ready and raring to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>They have Emmel... They have one of ours in their clutches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Icona was keenly interested in Emmel. It seems most likely that she is being held captive in the research facility within the clocktower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>While we're at it, we can get our airship back, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Don't forget they've still got their greedy hands on our Libra!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We're gonna get it back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We'll have to if we want to take on a Cursed Beast, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's settled, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What are you up to, old dog?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Don't you "old dog" me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>As it happens, we've got all the furnishings to cobble together a few weapons right here, so I'm working on that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Is that so? Then might I put in a request?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>As long as you don't mind that I can't imbue them with magic like the Dragonslayer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Whatever you can make will suffice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Don't you need to do some preparing of your own, Adaleigh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh, uh, yep! Right you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hey, Nimul, I'm going to need a little time. Say, three hours? Can you give me that long?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Sure. In the meanwhile, I'll be putting together an infiltration strategy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Minario, could you lend me some of your knowledge about the clocktower?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You bet I can! I know a lot about this tower, whether it be its security protocols or a certain bigwig's hidden escape route.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>If you think that sort of tidbit could come in handy, there's plenty more where that came from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hmmm... Just like I thought, a frontal assault would be pretty tough...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>This is the heart of this region, after all. For all of us to go charging in headfirst would be quite the challenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Which is why we'll have to go covertly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Hm... Resources from across the region are currently being delivered to the clocktower to aid in the effort to control the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>There's an idea. If we conceal ourselves among the deliveries and sneak in that way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Do you think you could arrange for that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>As long as Icona is our enemy, they'll know I'm helping you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>But we'll make it work. I have a trump card for crossing that dangerous bridge when it's time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I'm all done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>This is the best I can throw together in a pinch. It'll have to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Great, then we're all set. Let's go get Emmel back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Right. Leave this part to me. Don't you dare poke your noses out from that cargo, you got it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>We're counting on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Emergency protocols are in effect. Your cooperation is expected. Please present your courier ID for verification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Will this do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>ID verified. You are cleared for delivery. Please proceed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Whew... I'm sweating buckets right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Gah! It's so cramped! Can't we do something about this crush?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You should be grateful there's anywhere to hide at all. Getting an ID for approval of cargo any larger than this would be a nightmare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>At least it got us in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Right? That was almost too easy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Indeed. Getting here was far easier than I expected. Is this really the right place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It ought to be... But like you say, security does seem a little light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>The mayor must have learned of our escape by now... Perhaps we should consider whether this a trap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Even if it is, what else can we do if we want to save Emmel and put an end to Icona's plans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Minario and I will take the lead from here. Stay close, everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What's the problem? Why did you stop? You're not lost, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Minario, could this be...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Mhmm. That clamor is unmistakable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>The clocktower's interior is shifting around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>This clocktower can change its internal structure? That seems like a lot of effort just to ward off an intruder or two, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>No, that can't be right! This tower doesn't have a security protocol like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>If I were to take a guess... I'd say that this is happening because the clocktower is moving to separate itself from Redington.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Separate...? But isn't this tower what keeps the whole city afloat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>If it disengages from the city, won't the city go crashing down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>No, I already told you, didn't I? There are sub-mechanisms all over the city to generate propulsion in the event that the main source is cut off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>That will be enough to sustain floatation a short time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>But what's the point?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I'd like to know that my—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>The point is to generate enough power to capture a Cursed Beast, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Icona?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Hi there, Adaleigh! I've been waiting for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>What have you done with Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Oh, do calm down, won't you? We went out of our way to give you a warm welcome. The least you could do is show a little gratitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>You set us up to cause the Cursed Beast's awakening! How dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>My, oh my. Sorry about that. But you lot are hardly innocent in all this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Who do you think you are, trying to quell calamities the likes of which you do not comprehend with brute force?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Even if it were possible, the pros and cons don't really add up, now do they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>The Cursed Beasts plunge our people into sin, call down calamities upon our lands, and threaten our very existence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>How can you condemn us for fighting back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>It wouldn't be the first time humanity clashed with the ecology of other forms of life. We see it happen between humans and animals all the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Don't you think it's a bit extreme to resort to eradication as the first means of retaliation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Shouldn't coexistence be the priority? If that fails, then separation of habitats. Eradication should only ever be the very last resort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>If we resort to immediately killing off everything that gets in our way, what would become of the world? Surely you have some idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>So that's your rationale for preserving and using the Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>What greater outcome could there be than if we were to succeed? Better to leave our options open, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>The future is never certain. In order to forge on ahead, we must have a deep understanding of what we need and don't need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>However, how could humanity ever know which is which? What gives us the right to choose? In the absence of knowing, we must hold on to every option available to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Do you not see that the Cursed Beasts could be something we might need to forge on with our future?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Need the Cursed Beasts? For our future...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>By the looks of it, the thought hadn't occurred to you at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>So...you're saying that the pain and suffering of those who live in this region means nothing at all if you can harness the Cursed Beasts for your vision of the future?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>This region is merely a testing ground. If the experiment fails, it will be tragic, to be sure...but thankfully, there are six other regions to move on to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>You fiend! Do you realize exactly what it is that you are saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Oh, yes, but never fear. I have laid out plans for the survivors in the worst case scenario, as it were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Should the experiment fail, then the people of this region need simply to toddle along to another region that will have them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>And my father agreed to all this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>How expressive your face is, Minario... Indeed, your own father—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I believe that's my cue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Father!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Distance makes the heart grow fonder, my son. Yet I have no right to address you so any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I thought you wanted to make this region thrive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Wasn't that why you imposed such an ambitious drive for production on the surface folk, forcing them to push through all of the hardship?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Is this what they strived so hard for?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>One thousand, three hundred, and eighty five.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>What's...that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>That's the estimated number of years required for all of the research projects we are undertaking to come to fruition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Resources are limited. Even the stones of the gods that we mine from the veins will eventually be exhausted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Even putting that aside, the Cursed Beast's recent activity is paring down the number of miners so drastically that the productivity of this region will collapse sooner rather than later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>At this rate, one way or another, our research will falter in the near future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>We may as well try to use the Cursed Beast's magil as a resource in the meantime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Yes... A mechanism that converts the endless font of human sin into magil... If we could get our hands on that, our energy troubles would be a thing of the past!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>If we obtain Belphegor, there will be no limit to what we can achieve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>On top of that, the surface dwellers would be free of dreary, backbreaking work of mining.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>The promised land awaits! We of Sloth will welcome a new age of indolence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Don't you see how impossible that is?! You're pinning all of your hopes on capturing and controlling a Cursed Beast! That's just not—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>I'm well aware that it's a long shot. Nevertheless, as mayor of Redington, I have deemed it worth the attempt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>I do not seek your approval. The way of Sloth is to revere our research above all else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>You...! You've lost your damn mind! Father, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>That's more than enough pleasantries, wouldn't you say? Do forgive me, but we'll be taking our leave now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Hey! Icona!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Unfortunately, I have a lot on my plate right now, but rest assured that our little welcome party is far from over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>If you're interested in learning the results of our little experiment, all you need do is ascend the clocktower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I have VIP seats reserved just for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Nngh... There's just too many. There's no end to them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Nimul, Adaleigh... Go on ahead. We'll stay here and slow them down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Aww, we're really doing this, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>You'll just have to accept it, Mira. Only a few of us can fight at our full capacity right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Aww, but if only we had access to magil, then... It's just not fair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>This is just how it is. Get going, you two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Oh, right! Off we go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Thank you! Minario, you'll have to lead the way for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Got it! I've got one hell of a reason to sock my father one now, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Are they clear...? Very well, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>I shall put this blade to the test, here and now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Do keep in mind what a rush job it was, won't you? If you're not careful with it, it might snap like a twig.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Then it shall be the wielder's skill that determines its effectiveness... Duly noted. Luckily, that's just how I like it!</td>
</tr>
