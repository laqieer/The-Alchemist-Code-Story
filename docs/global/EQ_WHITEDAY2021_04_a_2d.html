<td>Whew... We've driven off the monsters. We should be safe for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Still, the air here is think with that smell. It's only a matter of time before any addicted monsters show up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Those monsters just now are docile creatures. Usually they'd never attack a human habitat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I imagine they ate some of the marshmallows stolen off the merchant on the road, and now they're obsessed with the stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You're kidding me... I had no clue mashiro flour had such dangerous side effects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>All I wanted was to help save my shop. If I could make cheap treats to entice people to our place, the whole business could make a comeback.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But my pops is a stickler for ingredients, and refused to acknowledge my creation. No good for traditional sweets, he said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So you ran away from home, and sold your mashiro flour know-how to a noble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Then the guy abused your formula to make addicted marshmallows he could sell in town. Sound about right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I just...wanted to protect my shop. I thought a good chunk of change could keep us above water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>"Baking sweets that bring sincere smiles to our buyers." Your father told us about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>"Be it recipes or ingredients, there's no cutting corners when it comes to making customers grin from ear to ear."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The way you hold your shop dear tells me you feel the same way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>"Sweets that bring sincere smiles"...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The mashiro flour I invented is cheap and economical. The sweet aftertaste keeps people coming back for more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But... Even if that taste offers momentary bliss, it eventually gives way to despair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So in that sense, they don't bring smiles to anyone. So that's why pops...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Thanks, you guys, I get it now. I see where I've lost my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Is that right? You and your father have the same objective in mind. A meeting of minds couldn't hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>He believed you'll come back. "No one loves my sweets more than him," he said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Pops...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You and your father should keep making sweets befitting your shop's motto.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But the thing is, I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Don't worry, there's always a chance to turn things around while you're alive. So use it! That's my way... The way of the life-giving swordhand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The life-giving swordhand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I beg of you, please dispose of the mashiro flour we have in the storehouse. The job should fall to me, it's just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The noble hired mercenaries to guard it, I suspect? Leave this to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Works for me. I've got a bone to pick with that corrupt noble, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Thanks so much! I'll throw out all of the mashiro flour here, mark my words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Sounds good. And when that's done, you should head back to see your father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hoh boy... You really gonna take him at face value like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Uh, yeah? Why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That boy, man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>He may have earned your trust now, but there's no telling if he'll pull something like this next time money's to be made, no matter how he repents here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>People like him are a dime a dozen. So what'll you do if it turns out that way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Well I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I don't see it happening. I've got an eye for wickedness; I'm talking the worst of the worst out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's why I was shocked to find not a trace of corruption on that guy's countenance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I saw a light in his eyes the moment you brought up his father. Like a bad guy seeing the error of his ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Allow me to answer your question, Reimei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If things turn out as you say, then... He can redeem himself again. And again, and again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That naive streak of yours hasn't changed one bit.</td>
</tr>
