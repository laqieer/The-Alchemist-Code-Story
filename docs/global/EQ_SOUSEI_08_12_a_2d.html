<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Proceed with caution; I feel the presence of a Cursed Beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast of Pride!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ugh! This wind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wait, what...? What is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What's wrong, Eulalia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I... I feel Emmel's presence from within the Cursed Beast's magil...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(Has she been absorbed into the Beast, like when we fought Beelzebub?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Emmel! Stay calm! I'll save you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There's no need for that, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This was all my idea. Lucifer just agreed to help me with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Em...mel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Why do you look like that? And, this magil...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>After I got separated from everyone at Ire Belt, I wound up here, in this time period.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I talked things out with Quence, opened a dialogue with the members of the Infinite Serpent, and killed their leader, Shahel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>All so I could get some time with this Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Nimul, I have...consumed Lucifer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It was much easier for me to do what I set out to once he'd acknowledged my will—once he'd accepted me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What are you saying, Emmel...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm saying that...I'm going to be the one to save this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But not through the Ceremony of Creation. I'm going to use myself as a Vessel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I can't have you interrupting their conversation. They're deciding the fate of the world right now. No one else need be part of that discussion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>On the contrary, the weight of this decision is all the more reason to interject!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Then you leave me little choice but to cut you off by force!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Eulalia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I can handle this! Please just take care of Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Emmel... Are you planning to seal all the Cursed Beasts within your body, as a Vessel of Purification?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, that's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You have to know that's impossible! You may have the last Sephira engraved upon you, but—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Even if my soul is protected from corruption, my body—and by extension, my mortal existence—will not be. I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I am the Vessel of Purification, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Then, why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Let me answer that with another question, Nimul. How do you plan to save this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Through Alchemy. If everyone in world had the protection of Alchemy, there would be no further need to fear the corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Alchemy isn't like Spiritbonding. You don't have to be chosen, or have the Sephira carved into you. As long as you have the knowledge and understand the techniques, literally anyone can use it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>And just how long would it take for that knowledge and those techniques to propagate to everyone, across all the Belt Regions, hmm? How long until everyone can actually use Alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Your heart's in the right place, but you're far too naive. If we did things your way, the whole world would be lost to corruption before the people had a chance to be saved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'll protect everyone until they can protect themselves! I just need to make use of this power, and—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Access to Invidia Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Access to Ire Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Do you know how I was able to block your Alchemy just now, Nimul? Despite my power being what it is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I suspect you've realized it by now. If you let that power inside you build up too much, it will destroy you from within.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That's why you've been so careful with it. You've been metering it out carefully so it wouldn't exceed your physical limitations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But what of the people you supposedly want to pass that power on to? Do you think they'll be able to do the same?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Do you think they could live with the constant fear of being ruined by the power inside them? Do you think they could accept that risk and continue living normal lives?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>From the people I've observed in the various Belt Regions, I do! Most of them are already living with similarly grave risks as it is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>And there are just as many people dying to those risks, every day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You are simply being too optimistic, Nimul. Not everyone can live like you. Not everyone has that kind of strength...that kind of self-discipline.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Deep down, I think you know I'm right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Even when we were looking after Gula Belt, there were so many people who simply couldn't handle the struggle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I remember. Believe me, I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But people are resilient, on the whole. The point is simply to give them the chance to stand up to these hardships, rather than deciding for them that they won't be able.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You can't entrust the weight of the future to idealistic beliefs and faith in your fellow man, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Let me save the seven Belt Regions. Let me be the one to save this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'll fulfill the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg's prayers by sacrificing my life as the Vessel of Purification, as I've always been prepared to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Lucifer understands. He's accepted me. As long as he and I combine our attributes as Cursed Beast and Vessel respectively, we can seal all seven cores—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>And what would that accomplish?! Things would be no different than they have been!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I've sworn to change this world for the better, not maintain the status quo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>And you will! But it doesn't have to be right now, does it? These things take time. And I can give you that time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Emmel, you don't—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>No, you don't. You don't have to worry. You'll have all the time you need. I know you will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>That's not what I'm—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Grrrooooooaarrhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Nimul, the Beast—Lucifer—is making its move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I'm so sorry, Eulalia. Please take care of Nimu—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Emmel, please! Can't you see how impulsive this is?! Don't you know how unfair this is?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...I can. And I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Well, if you're not backing down, then I won't either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Don't be so sure about that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>What?! This girl is skilled in a surprisingly large variety of magil for someone of her stature!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>My stature?! You're one to talk, shorty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I'm still growing, I'll have you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>And you know I'm older than you, right? I pretty much have to be! So why don't you respect your elders?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You're older than me? Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Ooh, you're so stubborn! Just like Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>What? Am I really stubborn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Sleep for now, Nimul. When you awake, everything will be over.</td>
</tr>
