<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>That over there, is that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So it was you, Adaleigh. You've gotten so big.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Why? Why are you talking to me as if things are normal?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>At least look a little surprised!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well, from where I'm standing, it was an easy guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Quence's wish was to return the past, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No matter how that turned out, there was a chance that the future you would run into me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This happening was accident, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Was it now? So Quence's pitch failed, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, he was never good at talking. He's a talks a lot, but the important bits never get across.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's mean. Wasn't he your comrade?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's because he was my ally that I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We may have had the same views, but we didn't share the same goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We were just using each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Do you know how I can get back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, well, well. You'd still ask me that? Even though we're destined to be enemies in the future?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That...may be true, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Why did I even get sent to this time in the first place? Didn't Quence want to go to a time before the Cursed Beasts were created?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, I do know the theory behind Space-Time Manipulation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This is just a guess, but the foundation of Quence's spell is in thoughts of the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Thoughts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes, thoughts. Feelings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Lingering attachments and regrets from the past. The harder he wish to change the past, the stronger the spell becomes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But if those thoughts suddenly got interrupted...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Something happened and Quence let go of his control over the spell?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yep, or at least, that's what it looked like to me! And that resulted in you all getting pulled into the time periods of your personal, lingering attachments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So that's the position you're in right now. It may be a hypothesis but I'd bet money on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Did you want to see me that much, Adaleigh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Of course I'd want to see my family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I may be family...but I'm dead and gone, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You haven't died yet, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I might as well be dead. The second you got swept into this time as you are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's the moment my loss was decided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Congratulations, Adaleigh. You've won our very first sibling squabble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You're leaving already, Adaleigh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm all tired out trying to convince my hard-headed sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You really have no interest in changing the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>'Course. Adaleigh, I've already got a plan all set up until my death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No matter what I choose, where I get tripped up, or how I die, the result stays the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Because there's no way I, the great genius Icona, haven't made the best decisions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That's why what happened was the optimal result, Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ugh, are you crying again? Then, because I'm nice, I'll comfort you all you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm not gonna cry. I've cried enough as it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I see. Then, you know what to do now, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'll keep moving forward no matter what happens, and never give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'll continue to believe there's a bright future ahead and keep going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Good! Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'll see you later, Adaleigh. I'm looking forward to your souvenirs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I thought I told you that I'm moving forward into the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I can't keep looking back and trying to return to the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>That's my brother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Huh? Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Oh, that voice belongs to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It's you, Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>This is Invidia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Isn't that good? You made it all this way without defeating Satna and Leviathan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yeah. I mean...no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It's true that I thought I might be able to change things if given the chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But I also thought that if I did so, my adventure with all of you wouldn't have happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Andechs...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I really am heartless... Have I disappointed you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Not at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>After all, I thought the same thing, that I wouldn't want our trip to have never happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I suppose that makes us failures as knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Probably. Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>We have to protect what comes after this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Huh? Where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I don't know...but I'd never be able to make heads or tales of this whole situation with my brain anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Which is why we'll jump in first and think about the rest later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What?! Ah, w-wait for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Haha! Just like I thought! My intuition never lets me down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Oh? This presence is...Nimul's?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Ah, but what fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Being in the Forest of Suga, my hometown, back before it fell to corruption...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>It's probably being rebuilt as I speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I'll make sure it returns to its former glory one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Just as I thought... That is Nimul's voice I'm hearing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I'd better go, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Ambrosia, for always making a mess of things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. I have a lot of free time. Although...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Space-Time Manipulation: Ignition!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>They just keep on coming! Probably because this place has so many people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Yeah, this is just like when Belphegor ran amok. Was it different for your region?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Well, I was the only person left in the Luxuria Belt Region when it happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Oh, sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You saying sorry just makes me more upset about it, you know?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Well, I guess it's time to bring out the big guns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Whoa, is that...a staff?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Heh. It's Libra 2.0. I figured it was about the time my idiot apprentices would break the original.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Since I can't charge it with magil or anything, I can only use it to support my Space-Time Manipulation, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>"O time! Flow on! Forever and ever!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Wow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Now, motorcycle man! Drive right into them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Well, since you invited me so nicely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I'll send them flying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Now, that just leaves...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Waaaaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Aaaaaaahhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Ow, ow, ow... My control slipped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>It was a mistake to leave the coordinates to you, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>What are you talking about? You were the one who misread the transfer point coordinates!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Uh-uh, we prepared a flight spell, remember? You just used too much magil, so it didn't work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>You always have to have the last word, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>That's because I'm alwaysâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Aaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Ouch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Sheesh, I worried about you two for nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Ambrosia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Perish. Perish. Perish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Tch! "I am Transcender of the Gate of Lust!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Together! "Thus I am shapeless!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Its attacks are so powerful! Without an opening to get close, even if we had Gears of Judgement...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Then, there is no choice but for me to act as a shield so that we may push forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>No, you can't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Don't forget, Lord Kubera, that Mammon's corruption can make even dragons fall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>If a human were to be hit with it, even you would become a Fallen before you could swing your sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>So you endeavor to protect yourself as well as the lives of others. Then, this is a surpassingly difficult fight indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>That's exactly why we can find other ways forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I can feel it... The will of my allies, who are fighting just as we are, beyond the gate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>(I haven't made it to this point by fighting alone.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I was supported by many people, and met tons of others who helped me grow stronger, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>I can hear them. The seeds of hope are waiting for me behind the gate. Which means...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>"I extend a hand within myself!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>"I am the key! If there is no key to open the Gate, I will surpass time and space! And draw those bonds to me once again!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Cease your useless struggling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Apologies for taking so long, Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>But we made it just in time for the climax! Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Daphne. Andechs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>My apologies for making you wait, Nimul. I had a wonderful dream, so I am now in rather high spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Eulalia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Grrrooooooggghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Hehe! If you're talking heavy hitters, I'm here, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Adaleigh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>And don't forget about little ol' me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Nimul! Leave limiting the Cursed Beast's movements to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Lord Kubera...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>With my blade and all of my being!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I will slay you here and now, Beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Grrrooooooggghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>The Gear of Judgment...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>It...broke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>It is laughable how unprepared you are! You thought that would cut through my sin?! That weak work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>This is the end result of greed! Fall, Kubera!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Has your imminent death caused you to go mad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>The sword, Taurus, that blacksmith Yna Ku forged is composed of two blades! Which means...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>I've been waiting for an opening like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>This gear is the mark of my determination! No matter the time or place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>The gear forged by my hand will exterminate all evil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Even if it's not strictly true of the now, I swear that one day I will be called a blacksmith who can achieve this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>This blade is proof of that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Grrrraaaaaarrrrgghhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon has been stripped of sin! Everyone, move out! We must end the dreams of this Cursed Beast here and now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Now experience the full power of humankind, Mammon!</td>
