<td>We're going now, Dias! Edgar!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Go! If you find "him" up above the clouds, say hi for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Got it!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Whoa! What's going on?! I thought you were collecting the Sacred Stones?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? I'm not interested in Sacred Stones that have become nothing more than rocks. Besides, there's no need for me to collect all seven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The Sacred Stones attract each other. I am utilizing the nature of those who hold the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>In fact, having one of the Sacred Stones already helps inconvenience them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...Them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>More importantly, where is the person who entrusted you with that one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Who knows?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You said you made a "promise" just now, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You put yourself in danger in order fulfill your "promise"...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>He was a man. Yet, he was able to move you into action. That makes him no ordinary person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>He is now acting on his own. Most likely, he is searching for the new Belphegor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>A futile attempt, but, just in case, I'll look up this man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Futile?! What are you trying to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This is just a theory, but, once a Sacred Stone's lifespan is over, it is reborn somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>However, this is over a period of hundreds of years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No way?! Then...that island will once again...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I don't know how to resurrect a Sacred Stone, nor do I think it's possible. That's why, if you want it, I'll give it to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You remind me of him. But he wasn't cold like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I won't give up...I promise to resurrect Belphegor at all costs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Lisbeth! Don't you dare think you can escape this castle alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Seriously! Stop bothering me!</td>
