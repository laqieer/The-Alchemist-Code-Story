<td>Please retreat, Captain Zeke! This guy's power is overwhelming!</td>

<td>Sabareta, what you are trying to do will lead the world to ruin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Do you understand that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hmph. I throw those words right back in your face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I know the truth that you are trying to hideâ€”what you have erased from history.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't play the fool. I'm talking about your daughter Agatha's origin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You...!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Please! We want to fulfill the "promise" we discussed before!</td>

<td>Your absurd ideals again? With both our swords unsheathed, it's a little too late for discussions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>They are not ideals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I told you... We should be able to make it a reality as long as we don't give up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then, turn it into a reality; convince me with the use of force!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
