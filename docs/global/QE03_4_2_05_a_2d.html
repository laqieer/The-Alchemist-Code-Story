<td>At this rate, the insects are going to freeze! What should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>There's no magic to prevent freezing to death! If there were such a thing, we'd just as well use it on ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We don't need magic. Liz, take out the caramel jaeger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh...? What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>This is how we're gonna do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Whaaat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, yikes. It'll freeze if I just dump it here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I see. So that's what you were trying to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Thanks, Rebecca. Yep...it doesn't matter as long as they get warm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>More than warm, I'd say they're drunk now. Well, spiders get drunk on coffee too, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But wow! I hadn't thought of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Witches are always so narrow minded in their thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>They're always just thinking about getting by with magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The students are focused on how they can stand out with their magic and join the elite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's boring how they all think the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's true. I used to be like that too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Just when I was bored with all of that...I met you, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Alma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's never been boring with you, Liz. After all, I can never guess what you're thinking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Heheh. True. I would never have thought we'd be able to fly this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Sometimes I think you just act without thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Come on! I think things through in my own way! ...I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You're not even confident about that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Heheh. When you think of it that way, these insects flying around obliviously aren't that different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Right? Well then...let's chase them off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I am thinking things through!</td>
