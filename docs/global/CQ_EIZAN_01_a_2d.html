<td>003</td>
<td>...!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hey, what's the matter? Did you twist your ankle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...?! Ye-yes. Just now, when I was running from those beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>From the look of it, you come from a noble family. What're you doing in a place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>A weapon...</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>... ...</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(Not another one of these...)</td>

<td>I wanted to gift my frail brother with a new sword...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(Another pest drawn to my title of the Ultimate Blacksmith.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Sorry, but you'd best hurry on home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I have no intention of welding a sword that'll adorn some nobleman's mansion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Um. What exactly are you talking about? I came to this mountain in order to make...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Like I said, I...huh? What did you just say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I heard that this mountain is reputed for the quality of its ore, so I came here in order to make a sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Make a sword? You?! Are you sure you didn't come here to "have a sword made for you by the Ultimate Blacksmith"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I don't know what it is that you didn't understand, but I mean exactly what I said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hey, wait, where do you think you're going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I need to hurry up and make the sword, so I can return to my brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You can't. Now scurry back down the mountain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm grateful that you helped me, but if you're going to get in the way of me creating my brother's sword, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'll just have to kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh...? That escalated fast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Does that better help you comprehend the feelings I hold for my brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey! From the look of him, isn't that the Ultimate Blacksmith?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...And who are you scum?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmph. We heard you were an unreasonable one! Just come quietly and do as we say! You're going to make a sword for our master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You lot are easier to understand. If you can "bend" my will then I may just consider your request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Why do you ask another to create a weapon you seek yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...Who's this woman?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>How can you expect a weapon to be of high quality when you've had someone else create without any effort on your part?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hey...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Are you mocking our master?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The ore in this mountain belongs to my brother! So scurry back on down the mountain and inform your idiot of a master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You wench...!!! You'll regret those words! Die!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Argh! Why do I have to get caught up in this?!</td>
