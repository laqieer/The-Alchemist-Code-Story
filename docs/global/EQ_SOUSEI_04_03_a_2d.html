<td>001</td>
<td>Both the few Sephira that have come to try their luck in the forest and the people of Suga have been sheltering here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The Great Nidhogg's divine protection still remains, so corruption can't come here so easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>According to what I've heard, most of the Sephira are still in the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's Lord Nimul! Such a famous personage, here among us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Lord Nimul! You're safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Warriors! I am glad that you're safe as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yes! Everyone we left in the desert... I can't say they're perfectly safe, but they've avoided what might be a more perilous situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I see. I'm relieved...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We've come bearing supplies from other regions. If possible, we'd like you to relay some to those taking refuge in the desert...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>R-really? We hadn't expected such a boon! Everyone will be so grateful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Everyone! Lord Nimul is very tired from his long journey. Please give him some space and allow him to rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>O-oh, right. We all got too excited...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm sure that we'll have time to ask for more details later. For now we'll bring the good news of your return back to the villagers in the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Please do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Well then, Lord Nimul. This way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ahh! That was so exhausting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I couldn't handle that much longer... I'm still young, but my back is killing me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You're just like always. Ever the sheep in wolf's clothing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'm the priestess of Suga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It's expected that such a symbol acts a certain way to bring everyone together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>If I don't keep up the formality, people will start treating you like they always do because you're such a doofus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Hey...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Really? But it seemed like everyone trusts in their illustrious Lord Nimul! Total leader vibes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Right now we're in quite trying times, but usually a visit from Lord Nimul elicits certain kinds of reactions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Something like... "It's that good-for-nothing again," wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Ohhh... I kinda wanna see that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Please, cut it out. My reputation doesn't need any so-called help from you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You're just as exhausting as ever, Eulalia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You've really gotta loosen up, Nimul! This is why it's so hard for people to like you, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What's wrong, Waginau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Nothing. Just confounded by the spectacle in front of me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The Eulalia I remember was extremely polite and obedient. The gold standard for a priestess, if you will. But now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But now you've got this! It's fine, isn't it? She's fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I suppose... Yet I feel reluctant to take on another Mira...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hey! Whaddya mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Come to think of it, Nimul, weren't you traveling with Emmel? Where is she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ah... I suppose I might as well start my story from there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Eulalia, please listen. We need your help to save Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I see... Emmel was taken by some horrible person. This is awful! We need to go help her right away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Rushing in with no plan is a death sentence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That man Zafeiris... He is extremely powerful. If we add that to the threat that Beelzebub poses...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We simply don't have the power to take them both on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Indeed. Facing a Cursed Beast is already a battle of life and death...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But adding the variable of an enemy we know little about puts us at an even more severe disadvantage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>First, we must seal the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If Beelzebub is forced back into dormancy, we could purify the corruption that has taken over this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If we manage that, then we might regain the advantage over an enemy like that who is powered by corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's why you need my help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Someone like you, whose strength is comparable to Emmel's, should be able to reawaken Sephiron. That should allow us to put the Cursed Beast to sleep once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What? We're not gonna beat it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Zafeiris seems to have an uncanny connection to that beast. Defeating Beelzebub outright invites the possibility that he will strike back at us for attacking it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(And defeating it will force Emmel to have to seal it away. All to save this region from corruption...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(For now, I just want to buy some time. Just enough time to find a way to truly destroy the Cursed Beasts...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ah... it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>For now, our first step is doing something about the corruption of this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>And you need me to awaken Sephiron to do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes. Can I count on you to do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I never wanted Emmel to carry this burden alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I shall perform the rites in place of the priestess of Sephiron!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>All right then, let'sâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What's this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm sensing the magil of the Sinners?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That's not all! My connection to Nyx just got cut off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>An attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Finding the hidden village of Suga was quite some effort...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>But there is no escape for you anymore. All life in this region will fall to the sin of Gluttony...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That...is all that we desire of this world...</td>
</tr>
