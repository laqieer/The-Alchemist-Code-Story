<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>You wish to see Lord Fraise? State your business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Uh, y-yes! I have a letter for him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>A letter, huh… If that's the case, I can deliver it for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No! It's very urgent! That's why I've got to deliver it to him personally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's super-duper important. I need to ensure the sender that it was properly delivered. So--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmmm…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…I can tell you're skeptical. Maybe my face gives off a certain vibe…but I promise I'm not trying to trick you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Alright. If that's all you want, then let me speak with Lord Fraise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That was quick! A-Are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I was expecting more of a back-and-forth… Things would never go this smoothly in Lustburg--no way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Is that right? Well, if you do anything fishy, we'll lock you up on the spot…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But your face does give the impression that you really need to deliver that letter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Th-Thanks for your understanding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I hope that frown turns upside down after you complete your task. Our job is to bring smiles to the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I better get going then. Why don't you watch a training session while you wait?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…So, they bring smiles to the people, huh? That's so cool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>They train this hard to protect their country and their people…and they fight with pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>On the opposite side of the spectrum, the witches drive away outsiders and place limitations on their own people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I know they're trying to protect Lustburg in their own way, but still…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>…These knights are waaay cooler.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Miss Rachel? Lord Fraise has completed his training. You may see him now. Please follow me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ah, yes! …Wait, you're a woman?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh, no. I just didn't know there were women in the knight's order. It's hard to tell…what with the helmets and all…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The desire to protect this country is the same for men and women.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…Copy that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The commander of the Scarlet Flame Imperial Guard that was created to supplement the Blue Flame Guard is a female knight, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It was Commander Chloe's idea to create the special unit in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Interesting…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Well, well. Speak of the devil…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Keep up the good work. How's everybody today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Doing great! We always appreciate you looking out for us, so we're doing our best with today's training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm happy to hear that! As long as we keep doing our best, we can protect our people--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hm? Who're you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ah! Er…I'm from Lustburg. I came to deliver a letter…and, um…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wow, you traveled quite a ways, didn't you? Be careful on the roads, okay? Let us know if you ever need anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Well, I've got to get going. See ya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>She's so…COOL!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Sir, your visitor has arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Welcome. You must be Rachel. I've been told you have something you'd like to discuss with me…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>N-Nice to meet you. I'm here to deliver a letter from Eve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Eve?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>…I see. If that's what she desires, then I…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>…What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>…! My apologies. I was lost in thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Thank you very much for taking the trouble to deliver this letter all the way from Lustburg. I'll arrange for someone to escort you on your way back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Er…um…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>…What did it say? That should have been a love letter, but you don't look very happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>…I'm sorry. It's a private matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yeah...b-but--It's my problem, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Because…Moa is my friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You're a friend of Moa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Moa has been really worried about Eve lately--saying she isn't her usual self. If things don't work out between you two, Moa will be devastated. So…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Fraise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>…She said that was her final letter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>…Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>W-Wait! Let me see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>My dearest Fraise,<br>Are you well? This may be sudden, but...this will be the last letter you receive from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm so glad I met you. You made me really happy! Thank you for all the great memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Please never change and always be the wonderful, honest man I love. Farewell.<br>Love,<br>Eve</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>On the back of the stationery teardrops seem to have blurred tiny letters reading:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>"I love you."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>No way…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>…Are you gonna let things end like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>…If that is what she's decided, then I respect her decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You've gotta be kidding me! First of all, you totally don't get how Eve really feels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>She loves you enough to cry about it. You think she really wants to break up?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Secondly, rule #12 in the book of love states, " If a woman tells you goodbye, she wants you to chase her!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>R-Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Of course! If you don't go now, who will bring a smile to Eve's face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Sir, it's almost time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>…Forgive me. It's time for training. We'll have to leave it at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Fraise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>…You're more than welcome to watch, if you'd like. You did travel all the way to Envylia, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Today's training will include members of the Blue Flame Guard and the Scarlet Flame Guard. It should be a worthwhile spectacle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Whoa…When will I get a chance like this again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>…So, today I'm sparring with you, Vic? Wouldn't you prefer someone else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I told you not to call me that. Besides…I can tell you're…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>…Hm? What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>…It's nothing. It's just…I have a feeling I won't lose to you today.</td>
</tr>
