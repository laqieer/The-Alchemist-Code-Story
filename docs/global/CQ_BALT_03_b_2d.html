<td>001</td>
<td>We've finally arrived. How do you feel, having fulfilled your duty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Don't make me repeat myself. I was just taking some time off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, it doesn't matter to me. My work ends here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hurry up and collect your reward from the Guild. Then, disappear from my sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, about that...I won't need to be collecting any reward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Aghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wh-what the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>There. I've received my reward in full.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>As you can see, for my reward I was given the choice between "gold" and "punching you once in the face."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You're an idiot, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yep, that I am. From one idiot to another...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Stop leaving your Guild and trying to handle things on your own, you big buffoon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I won't pretend that I don't understand why you acted the way you did, but there's just one thing I can't stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You've put yourself in danger without informing anyone of your intent or purpose. Do you think that's what your subordinates want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Leaders are irreplaceable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No one in the Guild wants someone that's irreplaceable like you to be putting himself in harm's way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Was that reward of yours...your way of making it up to my subordinates?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Not at all. That was my personal stress relief. After all, I need some form of compensation for taking on such a troublesome job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Why don't you people just leave me alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>An organization can't function without its leader. Whether it be the Sand Hawks or the Guild, this fact remains true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I don't need you to tell me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If you know this then you should be more careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I humbly accept your words of wisdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Tsk. You ungracious scoundrel! That was one troublesome job. My shoulders are stiff now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, that being said, I'm not walking away completely empty-handed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It doesn't seem like you're going about your job in a cold and calculative way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If you had been, I might've had to crush you before you involved us in your dangerous approach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm relieved to see that you've got some heart in the way you handle things. Your Guild is no enemy of the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If you had turned out to be nothing more than unpleasant business rivals, we would've immediately taken you down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I doubt you could even if you wanted to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Don't be too sure about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The diapers protecting your heads don't seem like they'd be adequate protection. I'm guessing we'd find an opening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>How annoying can you get?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's strange. I was just thinking the same about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>See you around then.</td>
</tr>
