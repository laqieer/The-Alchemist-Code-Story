<td>Zain, I appoint you as the tenth Lord Commander. As a symbol of proof, take this—the holy sword, Excalibur!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Zain, from this moment forward, your place is in the Holy Guard, and the will you must uphold is that of the justice of Babel. You must never forget this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I will uphold justice, no matter what! I will strive to never bring shame to the name of absolute justice in Babel...or to the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>As the great tree never wavers, as the ocean never reveals its true depths, be prudent. Become the sword that symbolizes justice itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Be the guiding light that leads Babel. Your fate and the fate of this world are one and the same. I am entrusting it to you, Zain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm so tired... It's so unlike me to go on an outing like this. I really don't like the outdoors. I'm much more suited to reading old texts in my room.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Don't complain. You want to find the lost truth, don't you? Will this take us to Envylia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes. First, we must verify whether what is depicted on that mural is the truth or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Speaking of Envylia, the 2nd Regiment should be heading out to battle with the Shadow Messiah survivors about now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's true... Come to think of it, didn't we receive some requests from Envylia? The Philosopher's Stone was used, and there was the matter of the Holy Guard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Argh! They keep toying with us from the shadows! Come out and fight us like men, fair and square!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Vice-Captain, we ought to retreat for now. It's inefficient to continue fighting like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What do you know, newcomer?! Turning your back on cowards who skulk in the shadows... And you call yourself a member of the 2nd Regiment?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What's more, our opponent is the Shadow Messiah! It's entirely possible that they will come for us the instant we turn our backs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>As Lady Kaya isn't present, I am the one responsible for the 2nd Regiment... So just be quiet and do as I say, newcomer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If Lady Kaya were here, she would take much more effective measures against them. How can you not have learned more from her after fighting at her side for so long? Did you learn nothing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Your only specialty is reckless behavior. It seems that I will have to make up for that somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You little...! Wraaaaaaaagh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Aaaaargh! N-no way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Y-you took down the entire tree?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Cowards who lurk in the shadows could never best the 2nd Regiment! I will fight them openly, head-on, and win! That is my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I know that even these rebels have their own sense of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>However, so long as it stands in opposition to the justice of Babel, I cannot let it go unpunished!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>There must be a limit to how inefficient you can be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's good, Monzein. Keep that fire within you. Use it to boost morale of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Wha—? Kaya! What are you talking about?! You're the Captain of the 2nd Regiment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You can't abandon your duty like this! It sets a poor example for the recruits!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That fire... I've never had it. It enriches your life, doesn't it? It's a very good thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes. Monzein...the day that you will succeed me as Captain is closer than you think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Lady Kaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Um, Lady Kaya? And...Lord Zain? What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's part of my duty as Lord Commander. I'm embarking on a very important... Important...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Research mission. We are on our way to Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I didn't think we would run into the 2nd Regiment. But I see that you are doing well without me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>However, these methods are...inefficient. Without you, Lady Kaya—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Wait. What's this? I sense a sinister presence on the wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well, well. You noticed. I think you and Monzein will make a good pair, Seida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We're surrounded! Prepare yourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Kaya, we should help them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No... We're going to watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This is nothing. You can handle it, right, Monzein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Of course! Lady Kaya, Lord Zain...! Please, stand back and watch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>We are the ones under attack! We are the ones who must fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Now I can finally fight you fair and square. My name is Monzein, Vice-Captain of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We must not embarrass ourselves in front of the Captain and the Lord Commander. Now...into formation... Charge!</td>
</tr>
