<td>The Jam are the product of Beelzebub's preemptive curse. I am able to influence them with my purification power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You purified them?! Why would you save me?</td>

<td>So I can get my hands on Beelzebub... For that alone, I'm willing to fight by your side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yet, I wonder what your goal might be. Are you plotting revenge for my having killed your father and Asena? If so, your motives are foolish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why are you so desperate to obtain Beelzebub?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You could never understand. Beelzebub's fate...belongs to us. It is my duty to obtain Beelzebub at all costs!</td>

<td>The destruction...of your clan?</td>

<td>I'm always saying I want to change the future, but I end up losing the ones I want to protect most of all. I'm useless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I hate him. He's the one who killed Asena. He's the one who killed Father. I couldn't even do anything to stop him. That's...all I keep thinking about.</td>
</tr>
