<td>Well, I said let's go back, but...</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Even if we were to go back to school, they might come chasing after us again! Liz, you should go back to your home for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But that will cause problems for my mom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But I guess staying here will cause problems for the school. What should I do?</td>

<td>Wh-what's this? Is it alcohol?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh...it's caramel jaeger...um, it's the sweet alcohol from Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It seems like it never became really popular over there because it raises the body temperature of whoever drinks it, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What is that caramel something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I remember now...that first time I stood in the hall...</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes...of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Matthew, you were the first customer who ordered from me that day that I first helped out at the bar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>R-really...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Even then...you were flustered like you are now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But...in your clumsy way...you were accomplishing your job before you. And...I was able to receive that sweet drink...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You can still go forward. Just do what you need to do...step by step.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Matthew...</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes...thank you also, Rebecca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I-it's not looking good, you two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Alma?! Where were you until now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The forest is burning!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It was pretty rowdy near the dormitory, so I went to look and I saw the forest burning in the distance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's the insects now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm just gonna chase them off for now! There's too much happening at once!</td>
