<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Bacteria...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>My deduction was the same, Tina, Mocca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>He-hey, wait! I don't remember giving you a really helpful clue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You sneezed, didn't you, Lisbeth? That was the big hint I needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>True. It all makes sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That being said, if it's true form is bacteria...then how should we go about dealing with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Although this is only my guess...when the Gluttony army went near the trees and did something, the Jam emerged...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It could be theorized that the trees were used as breeding grounds for the Jam outbreaks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hm. And when that bacteria and the curse of Beelzebub came together, it caused the Jam to be born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Although it might be just a theory, it sounds sufficiently plausible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If we do not halt the growth of the Jam, it could very well consume Saga and transform it into a desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's what happened in the south of Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ack! What are we supposed to do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Don't worry, Mocca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What we must do has not changed. In fact, it's clearer than ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tina...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Trying to place the steps in order. To suppress the Jam outbreaks, we must suppress the power of Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>In order to do that, we must restore the power of the wind to the Wind Temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>To do this, we must join together the power of fire, water, and earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>To regain balance, we must persuade the earth...in other words Tehre.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Similarly, if the Gluttony army is using bacteria to grow the Jam...it's the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>As long as Tehre is working together with Gluttony, we must do what we can to persuade him back to our side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Impressive, Tina. It's just as you say. Persuading Tehre is of the utmost importance. The question is how do we hold a dialogue with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Then there's still the problem with the people. Even if the Sprite Trio were to unite, we must ensure the unity of the people as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>With Fuu having destroyed Aria, there are still hard feelings from both the Tehre faction and the Voda faction. We must do something about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We don't have to time persuade every citizen individually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>However, this situation did not happen overnight. Likewise, it will take time to solve it as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Is there...is there not some way?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Don't worry. I'm certain we'll find a way. Until recently, we, too, never thought we'd be working together in this fashion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But look at us now. We were able to change. I am certain the people of Saga can too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You're right, Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If only there were some kind of law about "making up after fighting."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If such a law existed it would immediately solve both the problem with Tehre as well as all of Saga. Don't you think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What's the matter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's right. I'd completely forgotten about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Indeed. Well, we haven't gone there since going from the Sprite Quartet to the Sprite Trio. That being said...it's what we need now more than ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Did you think of an effective way?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yes. There's a certain law in Saga. It's been such a long time I'd completely forgotten about it.</td>
