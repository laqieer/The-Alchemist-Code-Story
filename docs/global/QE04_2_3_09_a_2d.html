<td>It could be theorized that the trees were used as breeding grounds for the Jam outbreaks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/voda.png" alt="Voda" height="128"><br>Voda</td>
<td>Hm. And when that bacteria and the curse of Beelzebub came together, it caused the Jam to be born.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/hoo.png" alt="Fuu" height="128"><br>Fuu</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>In order to do that, we must restore the power of the wind to the Wind Temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>To do this, we must join together the power of fire, water, and earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>To regain balance, we must persuade the earth...in other words Tehre.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/voda.png" alt="Voda" height="128"><br>Voda</td>
<td>Impressive, Tina. It's just as you say. Persuading Tehre is of the utmost importance. The question is how do we hold a dialogue with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/hoo.png" alt="Fuu" height="128"><br>Fuu</td>
<td>Then there's still the problem with the people. Even if the Sprite Trio were to unite, we must ensure the unity of the people as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/moca.png" alt="Mocca" height="128"><br>Mocca</td>
<td>With Fuu having destroyed Aria, there are still hard feelings from both the Tehre faction and the Voda faction. We must do something about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/voda.png" alt="Voda" height="128"><br>Voda</td>
<td>We don't have to time persuade every citizen individually.</td>

<td>However, this situation did not happen overnight. Likewise, it will take time to solve it as well.</td>

<td>Is there...is there not some way?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Don't worry. I'm certain we'll find a way. Until recently, we, too, never thought we'd be working together in this fashion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>But look at us now. We were able to change. I am certain the people of Saga can too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/moca.png" alt="Mocca" height="128"><br>Mocca</td>
<td>You're right, Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>If only there were some kind of law about "making up after fighting."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>If such a law existed it would immediately solve both the problem with Tehre as well as all of Saga. Don't you think so?</td>

<td>!!!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/hoo.png" alt="Fuu" height="128"><br>Fuu</td>
<td>Indeed. Well, we haven't gone there since going from the Sprite Quartet to the Sprite Trio. That being said...it's what we need now more than ever.</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yes. There's a certain law in Saga. It's been such a long time I'd completely forgotten about it.</td>
