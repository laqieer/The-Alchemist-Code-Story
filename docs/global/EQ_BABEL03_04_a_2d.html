<td>Hawk</td>
<td>You really think we would be willing to sacrifice anyone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Guard Knight</td>
<td>The fact is that the amount of Alchemia that can be extracted from the sand has diminished. It is evident that the sand's Alchemia will be exhausted at this rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Guard Knight</td>
<td>If that's true, then we ought to offer up anyone with large amounts of Alchemia. Just doing so doesn't mean we're sacrificing them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>That's exactly what it means to sacrifice someone! Besides, if we keep exporting Alchemia, the Desert Zone will wither away to nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Guard Knight</td>
<td>That's why I'm saying we should offer up anyone with a large amount of Alchemia. We do have the perfect candidates. The remnants of the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>There are no remnants. We've reported as much to the Holy Guard. Unless you're suggesting we have falsified information?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Guard Knight</td>
<td>No, we're not...for now. Look, all we need to do is secure some Alchemia. It's necessary for the sake of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>We can't keep exporting finite resources on the verge of being depleted. There will be nothing left in this desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Once it reaches that point, nothing can remain. That's why I intend to find a solution—a way to increase production of your precious Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>So I'd like you to hold off on offering up anyone for a while at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Guard Knight</td>
<td>Fine. However, you will understand if we impose a deadline. We can't wait around for you forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Understood. I'll have it resolved before then.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I cannot stand by and watch as the desert withers away, but...I cannot let them offer up the remnants of the Sephira, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>It might buy us five or ten years, but offering them up would only amount to a short term solution, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>If I could take their place, I'd do it in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, that isn't possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>So long as Alchemia is what they demand for the food and water we need, there's nothing we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>At the moment, we have no leverage because we cannot turn away food and water. We have to do something about that.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nefe.png" alt="Nefertiti" height="128"><br>Nefertiti</td>
<td>What? Are you sure that's what you should be dedicating your energy to right now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>At this rate, the Conservatives will get their way and the remnants of the Sephira will be handed over to Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>There's no time. This can't be just a side project anymore. I have to devote everything I have to this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>The only way to increase our finite resources is by both growing crops and increasing the total amount of Alchemia available.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nefe.png" alt="Nefertiti" height="128"><br>Nefertiti</td>
<td>That's impossible! You must know that! Why are you so adamant about this folly of growing crops?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Why do you think Alchemia was able to exist in such quantity in the desert? Alchemia resides in all living things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>If you think about it, the desert sands have absorbed many lives; the remnants of all that has died and decayed here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nefe.png" alt="Nefertiti" height="128"><br>Nefertiti</td>
<td>You are contradicting yourself, Hawk. Is that not the exact reason why crops cannot be grown in our desert?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Think about it like this: If many things have died here, that means that many things once lived here. To put it another way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>This must once have been land on which green life could grow. Isn't that a possibility?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nefe.png" alt="Nefertiti" height="128"><br>Nefertiti</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I want to restore this desert to its former state. If I do that, I can prevent the Alchemia from running out—and that is exactly what is needed here, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nefe.png" alt="Nefertiti" height="128"><br>Nefertiti</td>
<td>However, is it not true that you have so far failed to grow any crops successfully?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>That's why I need to devote myself to it. It's better than standing around, waiting, and worrying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nefe.png" alt="Nefertiti" height="128"><br>Nefertiti</td>
<td>What do you intend to do about your responsibilities as a member of the nobility?! This is too reckless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I won't know how it'll go unless I try, right? As of today, I'm stepping down from the nobility. I leave the rest to you, Nefertiti.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Trust me a little, Nefertiti. I wouldn't do something this drastic unless I was certain, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nefe.png" alt="Nefertiti" height="128"><br>Nefertiti</td>
<td>But to go so far...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>It's all to protect the desert. If we keep exporting Alchemia to Northern Pride, the desert will continue to wither.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>So we must grow crops, and restore Alchemia to the land. Then we can make the desert a place where everyone can live their lives with ease.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>If we can achieve that, it will not only be the desert, but also the people's hearts that will be enriched. Don't you agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nefe.png" alt="Nefertiti" height="128"><br>Nefertiti</td>
<td>Can you really say for sure that your reluctance to offer up the Sephira isn't the true reason you are doing all this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I can't promise that isn't a part of it. However, it is also true that I want to do this for the sake of the desert as a whole. I'd like to ask you something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Many of the remnants of the Sephira have been weakened after the great tree, the Sephiron, was lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>I consider them to be an important resource in this land, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>If we lose not only the Alchemia that was originally in this land, but also all of the remnants of the Sephira, what will we have left?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nefe.png" alt="Nefertiti" height="128"><br>Nefertiti</td>
<td>I...um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>That's why this must be done. For the sake of the desert, and for the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nefe.png" alt="Nefertiti" height="128"><br>Nefertiti</td>
<td>However, if you throw away your position as a member of the nobility, you do realize that you will not be allowed to enter the court ever again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nefe.png" alt="Nefertiti" height="128"><br>Nefertiti</td>

</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nefe.png" alt="Nefertiti" height="128"><br>Nefertiti</td>
<td>Hawk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>Nefertiti, I believe that someday the people of the desert will come together and care for the land as one. I want that day to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>That's why this land needs to be revived. I trust you enough to leave the rest to you. I'm counting on you, Nefertiti.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nefe.png" alt="Nefertiti" height="128"><br>Nefertiti</td>

</tr>

<td>That's not true. It'll be easier to grow crops with you around. I'm counting on it.</td>
</tr>

<td>H-hey, is that meant to be a joke? Because it isn't funny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>This area is an oasis. With a source of water so close, the sand here hasn't lost all life yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>If the sand is still alive here, we will naturally come to see what this desert is capable of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>The more successful we are in reviving greenery here, the more likely it will become that we can revive the desert itself. Gradually, more and more of this dried up sand will become fertile soil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>If we do that, we can bring trees and plants back to the desert. Look, the feel of the sand has already changed a little. Can you feel it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/carl.png" alt="Carla" height="128"><br>Carla</td>
<td>Yeah, but it sure seems like a lot of work. Day in, day out, giving precious water to things that might not even grow? No thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>That's all right. Everyone who lives in the desert wants immediate results, because their hearts are barren, too. Still, we can solve that if we pour our hopes and dreams into this land, just as I am doing with the water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hawk</td>
<td>See? It's just like a prayer, isn't it? A prayer that prosperity will return to the desert.</td>
</tr>

</tr>

</tr>
