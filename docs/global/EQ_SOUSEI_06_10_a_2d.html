<td>Phew…I'm beat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It could've been worse. What if we didn't have Space-Time Manipulation to help move all of them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We should probably find ways to improve our energy-efficiency, y'know…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's all you, bro! If it were up to me, I'd burn through all our power in no time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah…you would, wouldn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Now that we've evacuated all the people…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's time to--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Settle things with that lunatic, Quence, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Why so quiet all of a sudden, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's nothing…let's move out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(This land has suffered too many casualties already.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(Lives taken, time lost. Our methods won't bring them back. But that madman…Quence said he could do it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(…If so, is it right to stop him? Won't he be able to undo all this misery?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(…Nimul has a lot on his mind. I wonder if he's alright…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…Everything okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh! Sorry, it's nothing. Let's get going, Emmel. If we're going to face the corruption, you and I need to be ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're right. I can't keep getting rescued all the time without doing my share!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>…At that speed we'll make it by...next year, maybe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You expect me to go any faster? *Huff* Up a steep mountain path? *Puff* With all this equipment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, at this rate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>…Hold it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>His Majesty…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Andechs, there's no time. We can't--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…No. Leave this to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You go on ahead…I'll catch up soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Andechs, you--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>…If I don't settle things here and now, I'll never be able to move forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>…Alright.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I've...been defeated...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Not…just by you insects…but by the sin of Wrath that governs this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Many have said only the strong survive. By that measure, I have no right to exist. And yet--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>ANDECHS! How I detest you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>My past self is no more. The young man who was once heralded as the "Wise King" is but a memory…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The next generation has already forgotten the meaning of Wrath and the erstwhile ruler of the Ira Belt… It's disgraceful…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>…I was afraid of this. You are no longer the same man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Even if you look and sound like him, you lack his essence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Do you think I…or His Majesty, King Arius, would ever forget the meaning of Wrath?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Never! Not a chance! I burn with rage to the very core of my being!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>There is undeniable evil in this world! Cutthroats who wouldn't think twice about harming innocents--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>They sneer at our dreams and ridicule our faith. They steal our future…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>All of it enrages me. It's abhorrent...and yet it fuels my righteous anger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wrath is my justice! I won't allow evil to go unchallenged, even if the rest of the world looks the other way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Pff--Hahaha! So, what will you do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Now, that I am no longer king but a mere usurper, you dare face me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yes--I will vanquish you…!</td>
</tr>
