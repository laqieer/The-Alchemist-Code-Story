<td>Haa... It's over. Are you hurt, Luce?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Not at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Luce... I know you must've heard about the gang of thieves who have been causing mayhem 'round here, even before I told you about them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's incredibly dangerous for someone in your position to go walking alone outside the castle. You really need to stop—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh? How did you...? Where did that rabbit come from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A wild hare was hopping by, so I caught it. You have to be quick with these things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You must have frightened it off when you were fighting those monsters, because it came right up to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Perfect timing, wouldn't you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well, not so much for the rabbit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Anyway, as I was saying... You can't keep going off on your own like that. Okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I will do my best to appease you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A-appease me...? Look, just let me come with you when you leave the castle grounds from now on. Pretty please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>All right, all right. I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Come, then. I'm going to go and purchase the rest of what I need to make this dish. I expect you'll be wanting to accompany me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'll need salt and spiced herbs for roasting... Perhaps some wine for the marinade? The chef was saying that beer makes a good sauce, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>All that matters is that I make sure Leoniaz enjoys this dish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hey, Luce?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You can lay down your sword anytime, you know. There are countless people in this country who would gladly pick it up in your stead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't you think that your bridal training would go more smoothly if you dedicated the time you spend on swordplay to other things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Why are you so insistent that I relegate my sword to a display case? Why should I not pursue both sets of skills?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well, because I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What's this?! A gang of thieves has invaded the city?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Luce, get back to the castle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No. I will go with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>How many times have we been through this?! You can't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I believe I have also made myself clear on this matter. I will not lay down my sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Please, Luce. Do you know how important you are to this country? If something were to happen to you, it would break the hearts of countless citizens...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Including mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Don't you see? That is all the more reason for me to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I am the queen of Envylia. It is only natural that I should be the one to protect it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Luce, you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You don't need to fight! You have others to fight for you... You have me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Thieves, open your ears and heed my words! I, Queen Lucretia of Envylia, will henceforth personally punish you for your crimes against my people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Sh-she ignored me!</td>
