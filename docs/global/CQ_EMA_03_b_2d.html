<td>Finally, some peace and quiet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>They really didn't know when to give up, did they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Anybody would have been mad after the way you talked to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>More importantly, what the hell are you doing here, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What am I doing here? Well, we hadn’t finished our little chat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Anyway, Emma... How would you feel about helping me with my research?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Research?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You’ll be paid, of course. I believe I already mentioned this, but I find your magical aptitude to be very valuable indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, yeah. About that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I can offer you double what your current job pays you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Seriously?! But...why me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Did... Did you look into my past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Your past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Like... About how poor my family is. How they can't afford to send me anything. How the scholarship's not enough to pay for my tuition, so I have to work myself to the bone pretty much every second I’m not in class.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Do you pity me or something? I really hate that. I'm not gonna be your charity case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm gonna do things my way, and if that makes me stand out from the others... So be it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I see. I understand where you're coming from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But know this, Emma. I don't care about your situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm only interested in you because I love having cute girls like you depend on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wait... What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Was it hard to understand? Let me spell it out for you. I like cute girls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I've recently hit a wall with my research, and I've been on edge for a while. I suppose that's part of the reason why I was a little harsh with those men back there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>A little?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I figured that having a cute girl in the lab with me would help ease all this tension I feel, and maybe even get my research going again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That’s your reason? Does it really have to be me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, there are plenty of other cute girls in the school. That place is like a paradise for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But out of all those other girls, I took a special liking to you, because of your strong will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You said it yourself. You're going to do things your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>And you don't care if that makes you stand out from the crowd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You've got some pluck. I find that to be very admirable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Besides, I think that you and I will get along quite well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What makes you say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I really like your style—makeup and all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ms. Celine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I want to have a cute girl waiting on me, and you need money. I think this is a win-win situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ugh, gross! Seriously? How are you a teacher?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>How rude. I simply want to help a lovely young woman like yourself by watching over you as you grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yikes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I don't know if I'm the best choice for this. I mean, you must realize that I'm not just going to obediently do whatever you ask.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Heheh. That's perfect. The true source of magic lies in the fire of the soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>However, I must warn you that if you prove truant, I may have to...discipline you. Heheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>For a teacher, you sure set off a lot of alarm bells, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But you know what you’re all about... And I don’t hate that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ah! What a lovely compliment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That wasn’t really my intention, but whatever. Phew! Maybe I’m in over my head...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>But with a devil-may-care attitude like mine, I think I can handle it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hey... Ms. Celine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That research assistant position you were talking about... How much would it pay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oh? Are you interested?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hmmm... Hard to say. I might be in the market for something new, so long as I get paid more for doing less.</td>
