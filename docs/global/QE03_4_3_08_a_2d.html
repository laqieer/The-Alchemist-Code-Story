<td>You idiot...do you think a loser like you can defeat the ultimate possessor of magic in this country?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You're being unreasonable, Liz! How could you challenge the queen head on with magic?!Â </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If I continue to rely on Alchemy...it will only cause the witches of this country to suffer...and never be completely healed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The more I use Alchemy...the more I realize how powerful it is. It scares me, yet makes me feel like I'm capable of doing anything with this power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Gradually...I've begun to feel the weakness of my body as a nuisance...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Your body...a nuisance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wh-what are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Like you, Your Highness...I nearly allowed the desire for power to consume me. That's when I remembered...the strawberries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh...the strawberries?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>During a snowstorm, Dias made a house to protect the strawberries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>With the amount of Alchemy he has, he could've blown new life into the strawberries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>At first, I thought he was a just a kind person, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Now I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Dias must have lost something important to him in exchange for his power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Something important...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Dias knew...the danger of gaining power fast...the danger of seeking too much power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Dias was protecting the strawberries...and me, so that I wouldn't lose something important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Do you think a late-blooming, inadequate witch like you...can defeat me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Even if I am a late-bloomer...I've been slowly but steadily growing!!!</td>
