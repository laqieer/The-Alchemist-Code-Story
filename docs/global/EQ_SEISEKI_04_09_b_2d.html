<td>We've cleaned it all up. So, what is this super-duper invention of yours, Captain Othima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Well~</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's...a...secret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Uck! I know for a fact that I can't stand this guy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ahh. I can't stand to watch my teacher get pushed around so much! This Othima is no ordinary person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Shut up, Almira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Enough. This way of talking is inefficient. Step back to minimum distance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So I have a suggestion. How about we take that mountain route instead of this laid-back trail?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh?! Why would purposely take a long way around? This road is the fastest most efficient route.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yeah, but...I'm getting kind of bored of this road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The route over there has ruined and a nice scenery... Don't you think it'll help raise our energy levels?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Don't be idiotic! We can't afford to delay it any further!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You're such a square, Seida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No, to be honest, there's something really wrong about this route. Yes. This route is definitely dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Captain Othima, why did you join the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You said you don't like moving in groups, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yeah. I hate it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm gonna be frank with you...you're bothersome! Can you please stop relying my knights up any further!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Whoa...you really are direct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If you want to climb a mountain then please do so on your own. We're going to take the shortest route.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey, hold on...that way really is dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I can read the presence of monsters through the wind! Right now there's nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>My teacher's wind-reading abilities are spot on! She can read the enemy's position and the ally's position on point as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hmm. But I'm the Captain so I don't want to put my Paladins in harm's way. I'm sorry, but I can't back down in regards to this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Are you saying that you don't trust my teacher's wind-reading abilities?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's not that, but...try shooting around there for example.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Why would I shoot where there's nothing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmph. Fine. If this will convince you. Guardian's Arrow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>All clear, teacher!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes. Everything is as planned. Honestly, it's so inefficient. Anyway, I guess this is a blessing in disguise...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Gyaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Eeek...! What's up with these guys?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? I told you I had a bad feeling about this. You can't use the wind to read what's going on underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Most likely, it'll be the same up ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hey? If we do this well, we may be able to take a shortcut. Let's take the mountain route, Seida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>O-okay...</td>
