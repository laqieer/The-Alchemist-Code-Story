<td>Huzzah!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Phew, made it on time! Are you okay, Victor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Booyah! You saved my hide, Nina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Captain Vettel! Leave the rest to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Time to rain on this demon's parade a hundred times harder than it tried to do to Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Captain Vettel, it's all yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hyaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We did it! Nice work, everyone! That was awesome!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Heh... Not bad. Watching and learning from a role model must be more effective than I thought...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Whoo! Captain Vettel, you're the man! All that's left is a couple bandits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's...over? That's...a...relief...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Vettel! Are you okay?! I'll heal your wounds straight away! H-hey... Vettel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I can finally leave it all to you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The way you are now... You're...ready...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Vettel?! Oh, you gotta be kidding me! Vettel! Come on, open your eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I can't lose you, too! Come on! S-stay with me! Vettel!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Where...am I...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hello? Natalie? Chloe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...No one's here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hmm... Let me think. Bandits attacked the village, then I fought that demonic soldier, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...Oh. I see now... Sooner than I expected, but...I guess these things happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>At least I know I can finally leave the future in capable hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...This is fine. I'll be able to pass on without reg—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Please. Fine? Pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's too early for you to join me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You can't join me before your time. I won't allow it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Gerald...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You haven't changed... Come on, be reasonable. My time is up. We've laid the path for the Scarlet Flame Guard, now we just have to trust that the others will follow it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The others have grown strong enough to defeat even demonic soldiers. I've done all I could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Say that again to my face, Vettel. You disgust me. You're the Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Are you really ready to die here? What happened to the man who would do a thousand sword swings when we were still just the Scarlet Legion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>C-come on... We haven't met in forever and this is how you greet me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I didn't want to meet you yet. Your duty isn't here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>There's still things you have to do. Things only you can do. I won't let you say you're done yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Things only I can do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Draw your sword, Vettel. I'll knock that cowardly attitude out of you if I must.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Whoa! Incredible! The afterlife hasn't made you lose your touch at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's your swordsmanship that's lacking. Isn't this supposed to be your specialty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You're squeezing it so hard I can see the tip of the blade shaking. You look like a fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'll happily be a fool if that's what it takes to protect the Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>As long as I get through this, Envylia and the Scarlet Flame Guard will be able to move forwards!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I know I can leave it in their hands, that's why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Are you really satisfied with leaving them now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You vowed to protect the happiness of the people. Did you fulfill that vow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Didn't you vow to preserve the peace without the use of alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>There are still things you must do! You can't selfishly decide you're done already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You want to protect the Scarlet Flame Guard? Then you've got to protect yourself first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Or are you going to snap that iron will of yours with your own hands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...We swear that our iron will shall stand indomitable in the face of hardship in order to ensure the joy and laughter of the people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...Haha! Hahahaha! You got me good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...Good. I want you to be able to laugh like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You must be the sun for those back in the land of the living. The gentle light that reminds them that it's all right to smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>The sun...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...—tel!....Vettel...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...Please, Vettel! We need you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Natalie...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You can hear her, right? They need you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I suppose they do... It was good to see you again, Gerald. It really was. There's just one thing I'd like to say. Before I go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...You were right. There really are still things I need to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Come back here anytime you need that reminder. I'll beat it into you as many times as necessary.</td>
