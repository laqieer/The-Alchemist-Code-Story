<td>Ultimately, we weren't able to obtain any information on the Fallen. There's no way we can win at this rate.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Sigh... Why am I partaking in this adventure? I wish I could be in Zipangu eating miso ramen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Have courage, both of you! You can't let the darkness cloud your mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If the two of you become like that...you're going to break my heart too.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>With time, the sun is obscured by the moon, making it appear as a crescent moon today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(...As the sunlight dims, it steals the light from everyone's heart.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(Except for <p_name>'s...)</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Everyone, it's only a little more until we reach the Twilight Zone! Chins up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Why do you know it's just a little further?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The Compass only shows the direction, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The strange thing is that...the longer I stare at the Compass, the more I seem to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, it could just be my imagination!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hah... That's bizarre.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But, well, if you say so, <p_name>, I'll choose to believe you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I thought you might be afraid to arrive at the Twilight Zone, Laevateinn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's not that I'm afraid. It's just that I don't like to be thrust into battle without any plan, especially when we know we're up against a formidable opponent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If it comes down to it, we can just go into full demolition mode!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're right. The way that it is now, we just have to use everything that we can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Everyone, we'll soon arrive at the Twilight Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Prepare yourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This is the Twilight Zone? From what you were telling us, I thought it would be a more pleasant place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yeah. The air seems to be heavy and stifling...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It used to have a much more refreshing atmosphere; a peaceful dimness. Now it only seems to arouse anxiety...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Is it getting even darker? No, is this...fog?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(Huh? The fog here is thick...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This time you shall fall into the darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huh?! That voice again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Eeek!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We collided with another ship?! I guess it can't be helped with this dense fog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We didn't collide with them; they collided with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We won't be able to advance our ship like this! Let's move it aside!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We need to capture the captain of that ship then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, let's go! Amaterasu, <p_name>, hold on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The three of them board the ship that struck them. However, in the dense fog, they soon lose sight of each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yuri! Laevateinn! Where did everyone go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Did you find an answer, Liz?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, Mr. Ant...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We insects...who are under the curse of Asmodeus... Do you really think we can be restored to our human form?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Y-yes! I'll...make it happen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Look at you, in a place like this...meddling in others' problems...surrounded by strangers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Come now...Liz...when are you going to make us human again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Uck... We-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Are you telling us to wait, Liz? When we could die tomorrow? You're a cruel girl...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Well then...before I die...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Liz...first you shall die!!!</td>
