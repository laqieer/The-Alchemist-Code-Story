<td>Amazing, Edgar! You rounded up so many people in such a short time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm just lucky that Wratharis is home to so many good folk. Vivi, you're the real hero here. If it weren't for you getting us on our feet, none of this would be possible.</td>

<td>Charging at the Holy Order and all of their followers head on would only be stupid and further hurt Toritoh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>As a person who doesn't feel anger, do you really think I'd feel hurt by this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>A general who would go so far to save her men must, on some level, understand pain and sadness. That's why I won't let anyone hurt you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Thank you, Edgar. I...I hope...to one day have the kind of empathy you have for others.</td>

<td>007</td>
<td>By the way, apparently only a small faction of the Holy Order is working on each of these towers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Even if we destroy one, we should go unnoticed by the Order as a whole. At least, my inside sources have assured me that they would look the other way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This massive contraption is under the charge of only a small number of people?! How could a small faction construct something like this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's simple...if you have the power of a homunculus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wh-who the heck—?! Strong enough to blast me back?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Edgar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmm. You don't seem to be from around here. Perfect. In that case, all I need do is get rid of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Unfortunately, I'm responsible for dealing with all intruders to Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This...power! I thought it was the tower, but it was all you! What in the world are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh no! We have to get out of here! Everyone, run! It's the Führer... It's Wrath!</td>
