<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Hn... I can barely keep my eyes open...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Vettel, you look like the living dead. Don't you think it's time you got some rest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Got it, got it... After I finish up this last bit of work...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>After you finish all of THIS? Look at that pile of paperwork! That's not going to be done any time soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hold up! Vettel! You totally forgot to sign this paper! And this one, too! And this one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>S-sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Good grief, you're barely capable of doing paperwork at your best. You really shouldn't be doing it while you're half-asleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah... I used to leave this kind of stuff up to Gerald, but... Well. It's my responsibility now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ha. Well, he wasn't that great at it either. I used to help him with it all the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wait, what?! Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>He did it because he knew you had more important things to be doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Things that only you, the Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard, are capable of doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Things only I can do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You're still not in bed? You know morning's gonna come soon, right? Don't you have to help with the restoration efforts again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hm, yeah, I do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>See, even Ren agrees with me. Ren, he's been like this all the time lately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Excuse my interruption! Captain! We've got an emergency over in the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Wh-what is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>H-help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Natalie! We'll handle this for now. You go call for reinforcements!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Protecting the villagers is our top priority! I won't have a single life lost as long as we're here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yessir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Very curious. So many bandits all in one place? And I find it very unlikely that the average bandit knows how to fight like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Why don't you enlighten us? What are you really here for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No point in enlightening someone who's 'bout to die, kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I didn't want to use this after I went outta my way to find it but...guess I got no choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Uwaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What?! A demon?! What's that doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Eeeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Agh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This demon's got its eyes set on me! Take this opportunity to get the villagers to safety!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...It's fine! You make sure the other knights are safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Uh, are you serious?! Do you need your eyes checked? That's one big mother—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If we fight this thing together, there won't be enough people left to protect the villagers from the bandits! So leave this guy to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Grrroooorrrggghhhh! Grrroooooaaaar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Nnrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Please do not panic! The Scarlet Flame Guards will protect you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Easier said than done—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We're at a severe disadvantage with these numbers. Plus, our opponents seem determined to raze this place to the ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>To the point that they're willing to summon something like that over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ren and I are too busy with our own problems to take command of the Guard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But if we just ignore this demon, there will be huge casualties...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If only Nina and Chloe were here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Nrgh! If I can just stop this demon here in its tracks, somehow...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Vettel! Are you okay?! I brought reinforcements!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What?! You big idiot! You're fighting that thing all by yourself?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>He must've been trying to protect the others by distracting that thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It's pretty clear what we've gotta do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Lady Natalie, please lead the villagers out of here! Commander Chloe, we'll handle the bandits!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>As soon as the villagers are safe, we'll return to help Vettel with the big guy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>That way we can protect everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>As is our duty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's right. Vettel would certainly tell us to do the same. A knight's duty is to protect everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Everyone! Let's do as he said!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Agh... It's keeping me on the defensive. I'm not going to last at this rate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>(I wonder if the villagers managed to get to safety...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Captain Vettel! We've evacuated all the villagers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>This guy is the last thing on the to-do list! Let's give it a beating it won't soon forget!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
