<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Phew! Now that that's been taken care of... Nice to meet ya! The name's D'Artagnan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Pleased to meet you! I'm Fairily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You know, I was thinking about this while we were fighting, but you're as agile as a cat, aren't you? It's uncanny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What?! I'm no cat! I'm a tiger! Rawrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>O-oh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to offend you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Heheh. Don't worry. You didn't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I have a question for you, too, Fairily. Do you always hold back when you fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I could tell that you were holding back against those Goblins, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>W-well... I'm not very good at controlling my powers, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I always worry that I'll end up harming the flowers and trees around me, so I take special care when I fight, so as not to overdo it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I gotcha. You're afraid to fight at full strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>In that case... Why don't we train together, Fairily?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>T-together?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Us therians are always being targeted by poachers and traffickers. I've gotten pretty good at defending myself over the years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Is that why you're so strong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yep! Oh, but don't worry! Things are totally different here in Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Nobody treats me differently just 'cause I'm a therian. They see me as me, and that's that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's why I'm gonna protect this country with everything I have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Protect...it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh! That explains why you were training with such ferocity earlier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You got it! Come on, Fairily! Let's train together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>W-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You want to be able to control your powers, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes! I... I do! All right. I'll try!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Haaa... I can't...keep...going. Bana, bana... This isn't going well at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Keep those petals up, Fairily!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You might not be able to control your powers right now, but so long as you keep practicing, you'll get there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You've just gotta keep getting back up, like the grass under our feet. It might bend when we tread on it, but give it a second and it'll spring straight again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Heheh... You make a good point. Thanks, D'Artagnan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It also really helps to have someone or something in mind, to give you reason to get stronger, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>For me, that's Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What about you, Fairily? Why do you wanna be able to control your powers? Why is that important to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That thing, it...! It coughed up a fireball!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This is terrible! If we don't do something soon, the whole forest will be ablaze!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hurry! Rawrrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
