<td>Who? Oh. Coren? He was once an assassin of Wadatsumi. I thought we could use him, so I recruited him.</td>

<td>Dangit!</td>

<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>R...Ren.</td>

<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Well, he must get tired just like the rest of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Of course.</td>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Um... I don't think that's such a great idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Lord Zahar...playin' with a plushie... I can't see that ever goin' down!</td>

<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I can't stand it anymore. I'm going to go see if he's okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Hey, wait! Sis! Get back here! You're only going to infuriate him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>

<tr>

<td>Spica... You really do love him, don't you?</td>

<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>(How long have I watched over you from the shadows?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>(Such anguish... Such sadness... Such uneasiness... All the emotions you try to hide from everyone—I know all about them.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Heheh... Muahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>The most beautiful things are also the most beautiful when destroyed. No two exist in this world. I will witness the moment that I destroy its existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>This is the highest pleasure that has been provided to the chosen. The powerful are the ones who rewrite history!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I will eliminate everything that stands in my way and bring myself closer to perfection!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>(Even your subtle quirks are no secret to me. Since your escape from that extravagant prison in your youth, you have pressed ever on toward your destiny.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>(There's only one thing I haven't told him yet, but I suspect he already knows...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>(To become a dark elf is to shorten one's lifespan.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>(Furthermore, only half of your lineage is elven... There is simply no telling when your life will draw to a close.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>(I know that what you wish to destroy...is not the world itself, but rather...yourself.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>(You seek a graceful way of ending your existence... Zahar, you've already come to that realization, but decide to play the fool instead.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>(If that is what you desire, I'll play along, too. Your wish to change the world is yet another sliver of the true you, shining through.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>(Yes... That guileless promise from long ago...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>(A beautiful lie you told for my sake...but a lie which drove you to come this far for me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>(We've been together for almost an eternity, and yet, I have to apologize: I've told you one lie.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>(No... My feelings for you have transcended the realm of simple words.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>(However, if I were to put them into words...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>What is on your mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I...need more power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I do not have the strength to defeat Vettel, the Scarlet Flame Guard, and the Holy Order... Perhaps I do not have the power to establish an order of darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>You are the conqueror who shall become the King of Darkness. You must have the strength to bear that burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Listen to me, Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>You and I were destined to meet. It is my fate to become your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Thank you... My dearest sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Just promise me that my death will be quick and painless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>(I offer you my life. I have lived for this moment, and know that this was the reason for us meeting.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Letitia, you were the only one in that prison who would smile at me. You are everything to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>(You have no idea how long I have waited for this moment.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>(My life will be part of your life. My strength your strength. I will live on forever, inside of you.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>(There's no point in saying anything...but even if there isn't...forgive me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I adore you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrgh! Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Wha—?! Eeeek! What’s going on...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>(Lord Zahar... He... He murdered Letitia!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Lord Za-Zahar...! Wait! Don't go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>(No! This isn't me! I'm loyal at heart! I only live to serve him!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>(Yet... Yet...!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Letitia... That's not fair at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>(You...get to be with him forever.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I...killed Letitia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Her powers of alchemy now reside in me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Le...titia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>(I will never forgive you, from now until the end of time.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Are you really going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>But why?! Spica, why do you have to go?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>I'm sorry... I cannot stay by his side any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Lord Zahar must keep moving forward. However, I’m...afraid. I’m not worthy of being by his side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>I’m really...really...sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>What are you saying?! I don’t accept this! You hear me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Are you really sure, though, Sis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>I am. I know now, I can never be like him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I felt your ambition beating in my chest. For a hollow blade such as mine, it is just cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>You called yourself...Zehn? What is it you want from me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>I simply seek one thing: to know the truth behind each swing of my sword. That is the destination of my travels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>(If I follow him, perhaps I could regain that which I have lost to the darkness...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Heh heh... By all means. I, Zahar, will take you with me into the future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>In that case, I offer you my services and vow to wield my sword in your name, until the day I am consumed by darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Welcome. Heh heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>(Since that day, Lord Zahar’s darkness has only grown deeper.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>With my power over darkness, I shall cleanse the world by converting its false light into darkness, thus exposing the truth to the world. Therein lies the path to the undistorted truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I shall serve you faithfully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>(The mine, eh? They're going after the motherload of Philosopher's Stones! Whelp! Now that I've reported it to Vettel, the Scarlet Flame Guard will stop Zahar in his tracks!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>(Still... Can’t quite put my finger on it...but I’m getting a real spooky vibe...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>(Letitia's gone, and core members like Spica and Silma, have disappeared, too. Now, there’s this newbie... Zehn.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>(Things have changed drastically around here since I joined the crew. Zahar himself, too...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>(That’s it...fear. The only thing I feel around him anymore, is fear. It's a bit of a shocker... Could I...of all people...fear someone?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>(What in the blazes is going on in Shadow Messiah?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Ila! Are you really going to leave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Do you even need ta ask? 'Course I’m going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>I can't really explain it, but I feel like something bad is about to happen... Look, even Woody thinks so, too! Please, don’t go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Don't be daft! I'll be back, silly! You just sit tight and wait for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>

<tr>

<td>There's not a single Philosopher's Stone here!</td>

<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Arghhh!!!</td>

<td>L-Lord Zahar!!!</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>You?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Full retreat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
