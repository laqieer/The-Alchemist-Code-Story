<td>It's my first time seeing Sumeragi. But the Black Star blood flowing through me tells me that this is the real thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>So what are you going to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wh-what are you thinking?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'll let Sumeragi drink my blood. As much as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Are you trying to kill yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I won't live long no matter what I choose! I want to do everything I can for the people I leave behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Sumeragi's strength grows from drinking the blood of the Black Star...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I will give all my remaining strength to the blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So this is the extent of your passion. It's ironic that the best of us die so soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If you truly regret my death, would you deliver Ren a message for me? I wrote a letter, but nothing seemed to come out right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I refuse. You should tell him yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...You're not wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(Ren...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(I'm so proud of you. That tiny little hand that held mine that day can now go wherever it pleases.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>My death is not in vain. I can leave it to you to carry on my will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I hope you'll live freely in the place you belong with your eye on what is coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's right... Natsume told me that Sumeragi was the key to defeating the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I never thought I would wield it. I hate to admit it, but it broke...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It wasn't me though, okay? Do you believe me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey, Natsume...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You got so hung up on following rules and traditions, but did that really make you happy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Didn't you ever want to try following your heart?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Because I doâ€”and I'm going to. From here on out, I'm going to choose my own path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It was kinda frustrating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I couldn't do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I wonder if I can...be there for someone, like they all were for each other?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Jin kept his promise to his baby sister...but you didn't get to see me keep mine. It's not fair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Unlike Yomi...I wasn't able to meet you...one last time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What's the big idea, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Couldn't you just hang in there a little longer? Just...until I got home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Nobody...wants to be left behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hey. Come on. Say something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Cause I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yeah, I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>My other family is waiting for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>At least I have a place to go back to, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Lucky me, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I even start missing it when I'm away for too long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'll have to show you around some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I hope Vettel will welcome me back with open arms...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That'd be...nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I belong there now. I think I feel different wielding my blade now. I could be wrong. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I feel like I maybe understand a bit of what you told me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'll bear your burden, Natsume. Not because of any code, but because I want to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I may not be able to bear it all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>But for the people around me as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'll do the best I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Not the way you would have. But...I think doing it my way will be enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...Remember how we played with bubbles?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'd like to blow some with you again soon. It's been three years since you trained me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I don't want you to leave me behind. Oh, but I'll pass on more training. Though looking back now, I only have fond memories of it... How strange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>By the way, your handwriting is terrible, you know? I couldn't read anything you wrote, especially near the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>But for some reason I still knew what it said. It went like this, didn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Please... Please...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Live a long life, Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You really are selfish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But I think it's the first time you've ever entrusted me with something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'll do it. Or at least, as much as I can.</td>
</tr>
