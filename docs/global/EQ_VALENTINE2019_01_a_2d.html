<td>001</td>
<td>It's that time of the year again! Valentine's! I wonder what kind of chocolate I should make this year?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm really hoping we'll get some cacao seeds this year, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Suzuka, Itsuki, have either of you had chocolate before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Chocolate? I can't say that I have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Nor have I, but... What do you need me to do? I thought we were here to be security for the cacao farm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yeah! Don't worry about it! We'll get work done, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yeah, we can just think about it when the time comes. Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's a very negligent way of thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But I suppose Emma is right. There's nothing for us to do unless something occurs, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yup! Besides, the Rainbow Cacao, and the Purple Cacao that attracts monsters, have all been stored in the new warehouse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>New warehouse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's a specialized warehouse that seals in the cacao's special qualities. So long as we keep the cacao in the warehouse, everything will be fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Come to think of it, we haven't yet separated the harvested cacao by color like we said we would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Do we really have to? We probably shouldn't be messing with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yeah! Maybe we can have a simple Valentine's this year, and just trade chocolates around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why not? That should be fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The farm owner said something about cacao thieves showing up lately, but so long as we keep an eye out, we should be all right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We could have used that information a lot earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You worry too much, Noah. More importantly, check this out! I've brought us some chocolate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Tadaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Whoaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You make the cutest chocolates, Emma! Can I have one, please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So this is...chocolate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>How do you like it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's amazing! You made this?! You must be a culinary genius!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh, come on. It's not that hard to make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We can make some together later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You think that even I could create this delicacy? Well, then let us complete this mission, and get to it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ooh, things are getting interesting! What kind of chocolate should we make?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What kind? I'm not even sure what kinds there are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What about you, Itsuki? Any ideas or preferences as to what you might like to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hmm... Preferences...? I suppose I have a lot of preferences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Eve?! What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ack! Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Blech! What is with this chocolate?! It's crazy spicy! Is everyone okay with this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh? It's not spicy, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Bingo! Hehehe... I mixed in some super spicy chocolates among the normal ones!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Emma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Why would you do that, Emma?! Why me?! My mouth hurts! Aaaah, it hurts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Was Eve's the only one? I thought I made two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Mine was good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So was mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Nothing wrong with mine, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Well, that's weird. Oh, well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>W-water... Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Itsuki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hnngh... Something doesn't feel right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Aha! A monster! It looks harmless, but whatever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huzzaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Gyaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hey! Don't run away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Argh! No fair! I still need to vent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Itsuki...? What is going on?</td>
</tr>
