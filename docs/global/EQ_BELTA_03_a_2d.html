<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/belt.png" alt="Bertha" height="128"><br>Bertha</td>

<td>And the signal gun after a victory is the sound of “I’m home.”</td>

</tr>

<td>“Sounds” can also provide energy. The citizens of Envylia look forward to the orchestral band’s “sounds.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/belt.png" alt="Bertha" height="128"><br>Bertha</td>
<td>I believe that protecting these sounds is connected to protecting the country.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/belt.png" alt="Bertha" height="128"><br>Bertha</td>
<td>These past few years, we have had many small skirmishes with Wratharis. The orchestral band was founded in order to help clear away some of those worries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/belt.png" alt="Bertha" height="128"><br>Bertha</td>
<td>They can help set our citizens’ minds at ease by helping them enjoy “sounds.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/belt.png" alt="Bertha" height="128"><br>Bertha</td>
<td>So the orchestral band...is also fighting for Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/belt.png" alt="Bertha" height="128"><br>Bertha</td>
<td>Listen. You’re not fighting alone. Everyone has their own thoughts about it, but they still stand on the battlefield to protect what they love.</td>
</tr>

<td>What?! What use is making sounds?! This is a battlefield!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
