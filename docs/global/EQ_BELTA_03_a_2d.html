<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>(Those are definitely Wratharis soldiers. Judging by their numbers, it doesn’t look like this is their main army...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey, how’d it go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>They don’t notice us. They’re just carelessly training students.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Now is the time to attack. We don’t need our country’s permission. Invading Envylia will only lead to good fortune for Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Then we’ll carry out our plan tonight. If we can weaken their forces even a little, it should make our country happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This won’t be like all those other little skirmishes... This will pave the way for a full-blown invasion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(A night attack? To try to chip away at our forces while our guard is down?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(What should I do? It’s not a good idea to act on my own, but...if it’s to prevent a surprise attack from Wratharis...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(I should be able to get a little closer!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh! There you are, Sharon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Whoa! Idiot! Stop! Shh! Shh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ahahaha! Your face is bright red. So you have a cute side too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Be quiet! It’ll be for nothing if they spot us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Sorry, sorry! ...I see. You saw some Wratharis soldiers and went after them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...I apologize for acting on my own in the middle of training. However, I didn’t want to lose sight of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But you could’ve at least told me. I wish you would’ve said something. I’m your instructor after all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It doesn’t look large-scale at first glance, but you know that you can’t take on this many soldiers on your own, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I came here to figure that out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That’s not for you to decide. Our first priority should be calling for reinforcements. We can’t take on this many soldiers on our own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...I can attack them myself. They’re not at all prepared right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...As your instructor, I can’t allow that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I know I’m not that reliable, and I haven’t taught you anything yet, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I can still stop you from doing something reckless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You can’t just rush into these things. Why are you so impatient, Sharon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I’m not impatient... I just have something I need to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Anyway, there are no reinforcements. The only ones nearby are other trainees like myself and a small number of Royal Knights... There is no one that can properly fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...There’s the orchestral band.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Do you think they can use their instruments as weapons? Of course not. All they can do is make sounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That would just be noisy It would hurt my ears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You may feel that way, Sharon, but “sounds” can do many things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well, they’re completely useless on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Just listen. You don’t have to approve of me, but...there’s something you still don’t know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It’s something you should know though. Before standing on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...I’ve always loved the sound that cannons made. So much so that I became a gunner. There’s a lot of depth to the sound of a cannon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Sounds can convey things that words can’t.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Sometimes it is mournful for those who were lost in battle... Sometimes it is tense when warning of an enemy raid...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>And the signal gun after a victory is the sound of “I’m home.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It signifies that the people on the battlefield will make it home safely. I’ve always loved that sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I became a gunner because I wanted to make that sound. Isn’t the idea of announcing “I’m home” for everyone so lovely?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>My gunnery teacher always said that cannons can do a lot more than just hurt people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...Also, “sounds” are what saved me. When I see you, I’m reminded of my younger self.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...I have no idea what you’re trying to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>“Sounds” can change people’s feelings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>“Sounds” were probably Envylia’s salvation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...That’s why I think it’s also the duty of Envylia’s knights to protect “sounds.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>“Sounds” can also provide energy. The citizens of Envylia look forward to the orchestral band’s “sounds.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I believe that protecting these sounds is connected to protecting the country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>These past few years, we have had many small skirmishes with Wratharis. The orchestral band was founded in order to help clear away some of those worries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>They can help set our citizens’ minds at ease by helping them enjoy “sounds.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>So the orchestral band...is also fighting for Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Listen. You’re not fighting alone. Everyone has their own thoughts about it, but they still stand on the battlefield to protect what they love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What?! What use is making sounds?! This is a battlefield!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You can’t hurt anyone...or even resolve yourself to hurting anyone with that. It’s useless on the battlefield. ...Right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...Sharon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Sounds have nothing to do with killing enemies. Swords and skill are the only things that matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...Please get out of my way. I have to attack the Wratharis soldiers before they’re ready to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I’m going to slice open the future with this Greatsword...just like she did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Sharon? Don’t do anything rash!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I don’t want to hear your words! They just hurt my ears! ...You don’t understand anything about me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Sharon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Everyone...please notice...!</td>
</tr>
