<td>I guess this is about it for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yeah. The people living around these parts should be able to go about their trade without fear now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This really is a harsh environment, isn't it? Monsters, bandits, not to mention the blazing sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You would have to be pretty tough to live here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It is thanks to that fact, though, that we've not had to suffer the invasions of other nations. To them, we're not worth the effort to conquer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well that's, uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I know. It's all a matter of perspective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The fact that you Blue Tongues are able to work so openly, is partly thanks to the lacking value of the land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So, did you find what you were looking for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No. We're asking around when we can, but... Sorry, we may have to trouble you and your guild for a little while longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Not a problem. Your presence is of great benefit to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>

<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>In the desert to the west of here, there is a small town by the name of Bandit's Nest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Bandit's Nest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's essentially where all of the scoundrels in the area gather. A sort of a slum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If you can't find what you're looking for in the light, look for it in the shadows. I don't know what it is that you're looking for, but sometimes it's necessary to take some risks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Thank you. We'll check it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>

<td>Logi Crowley. He seems to be deeply involved with the fate of many.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I must observe him some more, to see whether my fate is intertwined with his as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Urgh! They must be shamans from Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This is beyond us! Let's get out of here and regroup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Don't go after them, Tina. We should check on the carriage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh, right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey, are you all riâ€”?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Tina? Th-this is the seal of one of Gluttony Foss' nobility!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Th-thank you. You saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Thank you so much, travelers. Had you not been here, I don't know what would have become of me.</td>
