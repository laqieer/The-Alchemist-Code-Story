<td>- Greed Dike, Grand Hall -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The low murmurs rippling across the gathered nobles ceases as Li Wang makes his entrance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Friends, esteemed lords and ladies! My thanks for coming to this most important of meetings, for it concerns our great nation this day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>As you know, Zheng Yi's disgraced house has come under intense scrutiny these few months.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Out of an abundance of caution, I have ordered my men to block their attempts at destroying evidence of Atropos's Core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sadly, it appears that the head of their house remains recalcitrant, and few, if any, of our investigations have borne fruit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'd say it was a miracle he wasn't ordered to be immediately executed outright for the abuse of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The Greed Dike nobles mumble their agreement, eyeing Zheng Yi and Asuka's battered bodies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And so I turn to you, my countrymen. After all he has done, I propose that we exile him and his house to the borders while he awaits further judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I am loathed to see Greed Dike in such a state, and I will be glad to carry out this unenviable work myself for the benefit of all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I trust that I have the support of my noble compatriots?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A-A fine decision, Master Li Wang! We stand with you and Goetia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Greed Dike is better off without such a dangerous man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Then we shall tarry no longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Inform the guards. Have them move in fifteen minutes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I expect you to be waiting at their destination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Of course, Master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Have you any last words, traitor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>None...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Save for a last bit of friendly advice about biting off more than you chew, perhaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But it falls on deaf ears, surelyâ€”deafened as they are by the sound of coin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Take him away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>- Greed Dike outskirts -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Flanked by two rows of stern-faced guards, Zheng Yi and Asuka are led through narrow alleys into the outskirts of Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>A guard runs over from the road ahead and salutes the captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>All clear ahead, sir. Ready to take over upon your inspection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Alright.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You there, bring up the rear! We're running on a tight schedule here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(I don't see any openings, my lord. The best we can hope for is the next change of guard.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(If we can make it there alive, that is.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(Knowing Li Wang, he has every intention for us to not survive the trip.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(Bah, I can just hear it. "Self-inflicted out of guilt".)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hey. Stop whispering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Do you want to be gagged as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(This guard seems familiar...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Aagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What the-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Gwaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>They've got conspirators!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Beautifully done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Thanks to your clever ruse that got us here in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Shion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>How-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>There will be plenty of time for explanations later, my dear sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Are you all right, my lord?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well enough. Now, before that woman arrives...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Ah. Speak of the devil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Oh my! A harlot AND a fox?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I expected an attempt to run, but this is a surprise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Unfortunately for you, Lord Zheng Yi, you and your little friends have squandered all of Master's goodwill...and patience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Grind them all to dust, won't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Yes, my lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The captain pulls out a remote, activating several Constructs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Such sweet sorrow to part like this, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But, oh, the irony of being crushed by the very Constructs you labored to build.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I won't be held responsible for their savagery, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>If you'd given in to begin with, things could have gone a lot better for you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>*WHIRRRR...*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Suddenly, a Goetia guard bot stomps out of the brush, its shell sporting several strange additions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Target...and, activate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>*BZZZZP!*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What?! What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>The Constructs aren't responding, my lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>BZZRT... WEAK SIGNAL. WEAK SIGNAL.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>COMMENCING EMERGENCY OPERATIONS.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Grr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Deploy the rest! I do not care if the prisoners are in pieces!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Y-yes, my lady...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Heh, looks like the Professor and Blair managed to get the Alchemia jammer working.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Asuka, take our lord and get behind cover.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>We'll handle this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Be careful, Shion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Ready when you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Let's give them a taste of their own medicine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>*BZZP!*</td>
