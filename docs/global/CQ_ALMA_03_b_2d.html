<td>The insects won't go away! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I was just wondering the same thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(Could the monsters from earlier have been stung by the insects and that's why they came this way? But that still doesn't explain why the insects are going wild like this...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Agh... Insects don't normally want to attack people, so why is this happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They don't want to attack? Based on what? Humans and insects can't communicate with each other...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(The insects are trying to chase off the students near the stew pot? Which means...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Lisbeth! I think the Vermin might just be hungry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What?! They're hungry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I see. Then let's give them all the leftover stew!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hyup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wait, what are you doing?! You can't carry a pot while riding a broom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm going to fly up with my Broom Ace and carry the stew to the middle of the forest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This way we can get the insects away from here without hurting them. Plus, they'll get to eat to their heart's content!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That makes sense... Hold up! A new student flying around without approval will only end up with them getting penalties!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're willing to go that far?! They're just insects and you... You could lose a lot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But the insects were once men and...precious to someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I want to use my magic to help people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Insects were once precious to someone?! I want to help people?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(This the first time I've heard a witch say anything like that. This is my first time meeting a witch who uses magic for others.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Whoa! This pot is heavy! Still, here I gooooooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ahahaha, you're doing it! You're drifting all over the place...and you almost hurt yourself there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ugh, geez! I just can't keep watching this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Alma?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'll go with you! We can carry the pot together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh! Okay! Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I think this is far enough. Let's set the pot down here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Let's do it! One, two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Three!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Nice! The insects are coming after it! Let's fly, Lisbeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We did it! The insects are focused on the stew!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This should put everyone at ease. Huh? My broom is shaking... Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ah! Lisbeth! Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ugh... Ouch. Broom Aces sure are hard to handle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh? Where'd Alma go?! Alma?! Where are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ow ow ow... You... You're good with speed, but your balance needs some serious work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You're under me?! I-I'm so sorry, Alma! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ehehe... Sure, Liz. Can I call you Liz? I think we're friends now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yeah! Hehehehe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Alma, Lisbeth! I was wondering where you went. I'm glad you're okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Your stew made us all feel better! Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Also, sorry for how I acted earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hehe, you did it, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Phew, our worries are over! Is Yui okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ungh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh yeah, why did the insects only go after you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Wh-why, you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hey! Wait a second! What did you just drop right now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>"This is a herb Vermin love to eat and, when heated up, is toxic to the human body and causes stomach pain." We just learned that in class the other day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Wow! Good job remembering that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>We just had that class, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>R-really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>So it was Yui! You switched out the herbs! And you lied about Alma telling you to do it, didn't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Geez.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>No way, why would anyone do that? Oh! Maybe you messed up and grabbed a similar herb?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Lisbeth, are you trying to help me? Or are you trying to make me look stupid?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Acting like a good girl won't make you a witch. You'll never make it to the top!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What?! That wasn't what I was trying to do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I can't keep listening to this... Now listen here, you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You need to stop looking down on people! What are you even aiming for?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>If making it to the top means doing crappy things like this, then I'd rather aim for the bottom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Personally, what I'm aiming for is something beyond the clouds. I think you need to decide what you really want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I thought you all were making a lot of noise. Just what are you all doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Phew, I finished. What about you, Liz?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Ergh... I'm terrible at writing assignments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Reflecting on today's practice and mistakes, formulating a plan for future improvements... This is more like an apology letter than a report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>And isn't the thing we should be reflecting about the fact that we used magic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Because we hurt each other through personal feelings and accusations, everyone got a zero for today's practice... The witches with elite aspirations are probably smarting from this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>But the bonds of our class have gotten deeper!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Really? Well, if you say so, Liz. At any rate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>If the teacher hadn't shown up in the end, things could've gotten bad. Why did I get so mad like that?! You're the one that should've been mad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I was more sad than mad, honestly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>That's why I was glad when you got mad for me instead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Huh? You were happy about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Yes! After all, it means you really think of me as a friend, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>In your place, I would have been upset too that someone would being so terrible to my friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Is that what that was? I see. If it was you that was the target, you'd have let it slide, but because it's a friend...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>(Because Liz is my friend, I couldn't forgive anything that put such a sad look on her face.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>(I always thought getting close to someone was just a way to collect information.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>(But having a true friend doesn't sound so bad.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Now that I think about it... Why did you try to protect me when everyone doubted me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Because I never thought for a single second that you'd do something like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I think that you're a kind person and I was happy when you said you wanted to make a delicious stew with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ahaha! Another example of your unique thought process. Is that why you jumped headfirst into trouble like you did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I wouldn't say I jumped in headfirst... Eheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Honestly, it's nothing to be laughing over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>But thanks to doing me that, we became friends! I'm so happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Heh heh... Me too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I've done a lot of things up until now to protect myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>But watching you, Liz, made me realize that using my power for others might be nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>So I'll do my best to help you if you're ever in trouble and need me to lend you a helping hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Alma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Or rather, as your friend, I have to keep an eye on you! I can't leave you to your own devices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>No way! Am I that unreliable?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Buuut if with you're with me, I can do anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You doing reckless things will put me in a bind, you hear?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Ehehe! Well, at least I don't think I'll ever get bored with you around!</td>
