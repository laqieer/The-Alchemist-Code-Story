<td>Well then, Lady Fayrene, after you've met up with the spy, we'll begin the plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Understood. By the way, what kind of person is the spy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>To be honest, we don't have the details either. From what I've heard, it's an extremely adept individual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I see. Understood. Well then, I have my Pipa to take care of so please allow me this space now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Understood. Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Why does my chest flutter so much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Even when I play the Pipa like this, it only intensifies this feeling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>When I play the Pipa, I don't have to think of  unnecessary things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Speaking of...I wonder which type of job that person was referring to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>My job as a beautiful Pipa player, entertaining the masses intoxicated with sounds of my work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Or my job as someone who takes advantage of my Pipa playing and kills people. That ugly...unspeakable work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I do this because I was raised to think this was commonplace, but...the truth is...I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I tried my best not to think about it. There was no point in doing so. I had no choice but to live like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I didn't dislike my job because I felt like it was dirty work. What I hate is using the beautiful sound of the Pipa...as a tool for murder...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Heheh. It's a little late to realize just how much I love playing the Pipa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>And there I was, thinking the only thing I loved was drinking alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Then you should stick to just performing today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Reimei?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You're getting better at remembering my name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Never mind that...oh! Are you the spy I'm supposed to be working with?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I was told to work alongside an assassin from Greed Dike. I thought there was a possibility...but it looks like it really was you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>After having met each other so many times, it's hard not to consider it might have been orchestrated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Heh. Who knows?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That being said, a Pipa virtuoso is something that's out of the norm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It certainly is regrettable that you use it simply as a tool for your other work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You heard me talking to myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I felt bad, but your performance was such that I couldn't find it in my heart to stop you by saying anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Heheh. The cost for eavesdropping is high, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You're right. I'll pay for what I heard. No doubt, it had value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm sure you could quit your other job and just earn a living off your performances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I don't mean to lecture you. I just think you should know that could be one way of living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Just my performances...but my performances have always been solely used as a technique for assassination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm in a similar situation. However, there is one difference.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The night that I first met you, I was planning on disposing of you as a witness. However, I couldn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That's because the very thing that troubles you coincide with that which I have once felt myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The thing that...troubles me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Heh. That being said, it was just by chance that I happened to run into you a second time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>And now, listening to your performance, I realized you have another option that I did not have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Do you mean living as a Pipa performer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes. Those who can hear you play the Pipa are truly blessed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I too recalled my past, the first time I saw the dances in Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Having long been tainted by the hidden world, I was surprised to discover that I still had such memories within me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But I'm not even sure of my own happiness, how can I bring happiness to others?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You don't have to think about it too hard. Living in the real world is all that's required.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>But, I...don't know...if I can...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What should I do...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I told you this before, I'm not going to lecture you. Ultimately, you're the one who must decide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Please...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...You'll uncover the answer eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Eventually...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>However, in order to live now, you must accomplish the work that is set before you. Can you do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You're right. I must put my worrying aside and do what must be done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Like I said in the beginning, you can keep it to just performing today if you want to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>No, I'll do it properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>If I don't...I feel like won't be able to eventually obtain the answer that I want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Besides, if I can see you working up close, there may be some things that I can take from it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>All right. Well then, all the best, Fayrene!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Thanks!</td>
</tr>
