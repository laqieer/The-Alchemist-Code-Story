<td>After being attacked in the ruins, I returned to the Holy Guard and continued my research secretly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>After having Antie analyze the pieces of information found in the ruins and the information from the library, I attempted to put all the pieces together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I ignored Cadanova's warning, and continued my research. Eventually...I found something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The Cursed Beasts... Great monsters that existed long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>In trying to fill in the blanks in history, I instead found something out of a fairy tale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Could this be what Cadanova was talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(Everything about the Cursed Beasts has been erased from the history of the Lord Commanders, to the point of being a blatant cover-up. The Holy Order... The world is hiding something.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(The ruins, tablet, and Cursed Beasts have to be related... That must be why I would be targeted.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(Are the Beasts really such a dark secret?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm telling you this as your friend. Stop looking into this. You're only putting yourself in danger. More than you could possibly imagine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(How much does Cadanova know?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I suppose it's time to continue our conversation..</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So this is where you were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Kaya! What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I have some unfinished business with Cadanova.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hm? What kind of business?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's a secret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You two love this place, don't you? You're always here training whenever you have the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. For the good of the world and to protect the absolute justice of the continent, I will become the light that marks the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Daily training is necessary to achieve that. It's my duty as Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Heh, liar. You're just taking a break from your other duties, isn't that right? Being Lord Commander is no cakewalk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I can't deny that. It's nice to move my body like this occasionally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But it's also important to not forget that feeling of wanting to be strong in order to protect absolute justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You really are passionate. Though I wouldn't have it any other way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(Zain is passionate, honest.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(He must not know the darkness that this world hides.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Kaya? Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Shouldn't you be heading back soon, Zain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You're right. As much as I'd like to continue, I have my duties as Lord Commander to attend to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>He's always looking forward, isn't he? He doesn't look back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The Holy Guard needs a man like him. Someone to give them hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I can't believe in the world like he can anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Even just saying that probably makes me unfit to be a Captain of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm surprised you think like that too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You may have darkness inside you, but I believe you are still worthy to stand beside a man like Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You think too highly of me. I know too much to stand at his side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Then why continue being a Captain if you think you're not fit to be one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>There are things that I can do exactly because I'm unfit as Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Things you can do...because you're unfit to be Captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Just as Zain is committed to protecting absolute justice, I am determined to be the hand that roots out all that has been corrupted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Even if your life is threatened in the pursuit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I have no other choice after witnessing what I did, and there is no one but me to do what must be done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Such as this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ah. So fighting me is another thing that only you can do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yes. If I win, you stop your research. It's too dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If you continue and learn too much, they'll go after you. Just like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I know how powerful your curiosity is, but the Holy Guard can't afford to lose you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>They cannot lose someone who can support Zain like you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Your passion really is amazing. I think you're quite fit to stand beside him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But I do like the idea of finding something that only someone unfit to their role can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'm surprised you are so willing to engage in this. I expected you to refuse to listen at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I came here to talk to you about this very topic. It wouldn't do to simply ignore your proposal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I know it's unusual of me, but...it happens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I guess I've gotten caught up in your passion.</td>
</tr>
