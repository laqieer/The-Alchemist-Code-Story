<td>033</td>
<td>Hm! I'll be watching over you then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well then, we need to return to the city to enjoy that specialty dish again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oh, right... Where are we going then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The link between different worlds, as well as the monsters' threat was put to an end.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Cheerfully and serenely, but with careful steps...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>this trio continued their adventures, with the name Chloe in their hearts. Would their paths unite once again?</td>
