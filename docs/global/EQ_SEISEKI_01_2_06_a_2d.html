<td>Too much time has passed. No one seems to be emerging. Has something happened inside?</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huff...huff...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're one of the Paladins! What's wrong? Why are you covered in wounds?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ughh...Ch-Chloe...was kidnapped by a knight from Wra-Wratharis...called Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Was he...in the ruins?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Zahar is trying to start a war with the...Holy Order of Babel! We need to stop him quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Very well. We'll stop him before that happens. You rest here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Please take me with you! I want to help Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This is now a matter to be handled by official Paladins. There's no place for Squires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No! Chloe saved me time and again! I want to do whatever I can to save her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Even if it means risking your own life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I want to protect her! I promised her on my honor as a knight!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Your honor as a knight, huh? Very well. I permit you to accompany us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>R-really?! Thank...you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Listen, Paladins! We, the Holy Guard, advance forward to capture the rebels of Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We must save our fellow Paladin and protect the peace within Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We, the Scarlet Flame Guard, will also follow suit! We cannot forsake our comrade from Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hold on, Chloe! I'll do everything I can to rescue you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ca-Captain Cadanova!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh? The Flame Dragon King Cadanova?! Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Know this. Honorless men have no right to wield a sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Um...Captain Cadanova!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Captain...did you know that Zahar used to be a Paladin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I've heard he was once next in line to be captain of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No way! I...don't understand it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Understand what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well, the Holy Guard is supposed to be a body of knights that protect justice, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Then why would someone next in line to be their captain do something like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Kanon, wasn't it? Justice...is a difficult concept.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huh? Justice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Over the past few months, Captain Vettel of the Scarlet Flame Guard had been picking up on a disturbance within Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>In Envylia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>However, they were up against the powerful knight Zahar, once next in line to be captain of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>While following his trail, numerous Knights of the Scarlet Flame Guard were defeated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Taking this threat seriously, the Holy Order of Babel requested the assistance of the Holy Guard. Thus, as captain of the 4th Regiment, I was dispatched.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Did you know that Zahar would show up during our final trial?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I wasn't certain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>With the possibility that he might show up in a place where the Holy Guard and the Scarlet Flame Guard were gathered, we waited here just in case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>However, we hadn't anticipated him setting up an ambush within the Trial Ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I had no idea all of that was taking place during our graduation trial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I don't know why Zahar is attempting to start a war against the Holy Order of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>However, wars begin due to conflicting interpretations of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Conflicting interpretations...of justice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Kanon, carrying out your own justice is no simple task. Do you think you can do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>My own justice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>A sword without justice becomes nothing more than a tool for murder. Don't forget that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Y-yes, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Um...Captain Vettel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You're...Kanon, right? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>U-um...there's something I wanted to ask you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Why did Zahar cause an incident like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>He said that you were his "nemesis"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If you know anything, please tell me! I want to save Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Right. Well, I believe that Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>may have felt threatened by the rise of Envylia,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>after its independence from Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The rise of Envylia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>That's why he quit the Holy Guard and returned to his own country, dedicating himself to enhancing his own Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Now, he's gone so far as to extract Alchemia Particles from young Paladins at the Trial Ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Was that...to protect Wratharis too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I'm not sure. Neither Alchemy in itself, nor the power it provides, will allow you to change anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Captain Vettel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>But it's all right! I'll stop him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I want to show him how foolish he is to rely on Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>U-um, Ca-Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Chloe is a great knight with a lot of potential! She is honorable and loves the Kingdom of Envylia! That's why...um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I understand. We'll rescue her at all costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Th-thank you!</td>
