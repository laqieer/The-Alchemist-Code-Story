<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I've been here many times before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But it's a completely different feeling coming here now that everything is over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>This is what I left behind a long time ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Haha! You've upped your game again, Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We both have. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Whoa, I'm not gonna go down that easily! Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Nngh... I still can't match you in terms of sword fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, I can never really keep up with you in our Spiritbonding training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I should at least be good at my area of expertise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Okay, both of you. Good work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ah, thank you, Malta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Malta! I'm glad you're here! Have you come to see me in all my glory?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Noooope!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm on my way back from training at the altar, then I saw you guys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You two really are close, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You know, Kamui and I are best friends... Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yeah, right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hmm... I'm a little jealous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Jealous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Because you've been spending a lot of time together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It makes me feel like I'm the odd one out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No, Malta, it's because you have your druidic priestess training and our schedules don't match anymore, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah, I know that, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I know it's fun to have guy time, but it's not fair to leave me out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You need to learn to adjust to a girl's schedule! It's good practice for you now! You don't want the girl you like to hate you because you're not considerate of her time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hm? Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No, it's nothing. I'll be sure to invite you next time, Malta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yup! I know you will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well, my father is calling me. See you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Isidore, you need to rein it in a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Sorry, Kamui...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I don't know. It's like... I can't keep still when I'm near Malta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Is this...what love is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>How should I know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Aw, man... I wish I could just talk to her normally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No matter how much I train my body, it won't strengthen my heart...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wait... Don't they say that a healthy body makes a healthy mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>There we go. Only someone like you could bounce back so readily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No time to languish, Kamui! I have to get stronger and become a man worthy of Malta!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>How so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's the thing. There's a point where training too much has the opposite effect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>If only there was a way of training that could display clearly just how much I've grown...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Don't get wrapped up too much into this and forget to stay safe. There's no point if you hurt yourself or worse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I see your point. But...mmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I got it! Kamui, have you heard about the shrine on the outskirts of this village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That place where the ancient corruption was sealed? The Chief told us to stay away from that place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's exactly why!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We're strong! The two of us can easily beat even the adults of our village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'm sure we can purify whatever is in that shrine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Where do you get all that baseless confidence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Now that that's settled, let's get on with it! Come on, Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>This is our chance to show Malta how cool we are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>H-hey! It doesn't look like have a choice here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That's what I would always say, but secretly I was just as enthusiastic as he was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>At the time, we had just learned how to Spiritbond...and to put it bluntly, we were young and stupid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We couldn't tell the difference between what we could and couldn't do. We just felt like we could do anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But that was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It's here! Look, Kamui! There's the shrine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yeah, but...this corruption... It makes my skin crawl. It's more than I ever imagined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But we can do it! The other day, we cleansed a Jam in our first battle like it was nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>This level of corruption shouldn't be a problemâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Uh, what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Urk... That's not a Jam! But this corruption is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Get back, Isidore! I beseech the supreme...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It's not...working?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Dammit! Then let's attack at the same time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Isidore, behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Whoa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>That light...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What are you two doing? Didn't father tell you guys not to come near this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Malta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Get a grip, you two! Aren't you the soldiers of Sephira, the protectors of this village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>R-right! You still good, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Perfect! Now then, you're lucky I'm here and willing to lend a hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Just a little more, and we'll have this in the bag!</td>
</tr>
