<td>Dias...</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>He seems to be temporarily blinded by emotions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I doubt it is anything to be worried about.</td>

<td>...Lord Gabirond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You've heard Dias's words. Does the king also feel the same way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What did he say again? "Using peace to start a rebellion"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If he thinks that's the case, there's been a grave misunderstanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I was simply ordered to ascertain the true motives behind your actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If you say that your actions are aimed at bringing peace to our two kingdoms, then I shall tell His Majesty so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...Lord Gabirond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The reports that Dias defeated the Demon on his own...are those true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Indeed. Even the Paladins looked on with astonishment. I suppose nothing less should be expected from a son of yours, Captain Zeke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You do me too much honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He still has much to learn. Yet, when did he gain so much power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Perhaps he meddled further with the forbidden arts... Is that what you are thinking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No... I believe you've given him generous opportunities to learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I can no longer ask you to sacrifice your time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I believe it is suitable that he return to the Blue Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Perhaps he has forgotten his original purpose and is now committed to pursuing power... Is that what you are worried about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No... As I left him in your care, Lord Gabirond, such fears would be unfounded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In any case, our purpose is to serve the well-being of Envylia—nothing more, nothing less.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This peace treaty is in service to that purpose. Please relay this to the King.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I will certainly tell him so. Please set your mind at ease.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Very well. I take my leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Heheh. Well then...</td>
