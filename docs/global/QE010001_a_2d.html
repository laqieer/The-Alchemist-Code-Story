<td>Can you believe it? We've been ordered to be guides for the Blue Flame Guard right after our first campaign! There's no higher honor, Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Just don't overdo it, okay? Ever since we were young, Logi, you always get overenthusiastic and end up losing your bearings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah, you don't have to remind me. Hey, wait? A-Agatha?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm going along with you two because I can't trust you on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Don't worry. I'll protect you both like I did when we were children! Heheh. I can't wait to get started!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Id-idiot! What are you playing at?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Go back, now! A battlefield is no playground—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Seriously, you two can't even take a joke. Wouldn't you agree, father?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We've been ordered to take Agatha with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ordered?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Agatha is a novice of the Holy Order of Babel. Furthermore, she is extremely well versed in the history of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The king has lent us her talent as he thought it would be useful for our expedition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If there are Alchemists in Wratharis, war may occur again. We must do everything we can to prevent that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If my knowledge can help prevent conflict, nothing will make me happier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Besides, the timing's perfect. I was getting tired of being cooped up in a monastery and having to pray all the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>A nun who is tired of prayers. Is that even allowed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Are you sure you'll be okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'd ask the same of you two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Logi, you're indecisive and unstable. Dias, you seem ready to rush recklessly into battle. Both of you are a long way away from being full-fledged knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Agh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>In some ways, this could be called my first campaign. Try not to get in my way. Understood, halflings?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tsk. That attitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yeah. That attitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No more talk. Logi, Dias, take battle positions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There are Wratharis rebels up ahead. We'll capture them for information!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
