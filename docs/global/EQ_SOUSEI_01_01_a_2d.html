<tr>

<td>A dream?</td>

<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What happened?</td>

<tr>
<td>049</td>

<tr>
<td>051</td>

<td>Um...</td>

<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>No... I just can't remember. Who could it have been?</td>

<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'm sorry, I'm being nonsensical.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You seem tired. Perhaps you should take a break from today's prayers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'm afraid I can't do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I am the Vessel of Purification, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Without my prayers, this land... The people will be afflicted by the corruption of sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>But you must rest at some point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>If something should happen to you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'm fine, Julia. Don't worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>As you wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'll be changing now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I have your clothes here, ma'am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>About that dream...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I believe you ought to be wary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It was just a dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>As you've said earlier, you are the Vessel of Purification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I believe that is reason enough to seriously consider what you see in your dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Heh. You worry too much, Julia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Thank you for being concerned, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I suppose... I may have been working a little too hard, recently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I want to go outside.</td>

<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>(A peaceful day, as usual.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>(What a relief.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>(Sephiron, please watch over us.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>(Sephiron, the Guardian Dragon, and the Cosmic Egg...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>(As long as they watch over us, this world should be safe.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>The Cosmic Egg...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>(I wonder...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>What could be beyond it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Beyond the Cosmic Egg...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What are you talking about, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Have you never thought about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I think you're the only one who would think about such a thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I think so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Hmph... Sometimes, I daydream, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I dream about leaving this village, and seeing what lies beyond the Cosmic Egg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>You've always been such a romantic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Yeah... I'm always thinking about things like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>What is the sin that we are burdened to shoulder? What if there were no sin in this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>If that were to happen, you could—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>No sin? That's... That's imposs... Nng!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>No! I...can't...collapse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa... I need to go pray.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>As long as I live, I must protect...this village from the sin... From the corruption...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>(The corruption of sin is eroding the earth.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>(The soil, the shrubs, and the trees are all withering.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>(Sin... Corruption... The things that ruin the land and threaten the people.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>(The causes of Emmel's suffering.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>(Is this our punishment? But why?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>(What sin could we humans have been born with? What could we possibly be guilty of?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>(If we are so sinful, then who is punishing us?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Something is just not right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>(Who...and for what reason...trapped us within the Cosmic Egg?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>(Who did all this...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>(Who trapped Emmel in this world?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>(Who...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>It must be destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I have to destroy this messed up world that Emmel is trapped in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I will win it for the both of us: a new world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>To do that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I must remake this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>In times of old, as ephemeral as it was, life undeniably prospered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Those fleeting lives were at the mercy of every phenomenon the heavens invoked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>In existence for longer than any could remember, the Cosmic Egg was said to have been made to protect such fragile lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>However, the shell also inflicted stagnation upon the circulation of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Life itself grew static, numb, and corrupted. Thus, the world saw the rise and rampancy of the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>The accumulated corruption became a wall, further hindering the circulation of not only the world, but of the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>And yet, without that shell, the Cursed Beast, or the wall, people could not survive in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>It is a sin to be alive. Sin will forever be a close neighbor of life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>That is the truth today...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>...and will forever be so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Growl! Grrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>That way! Over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Be careful! Don't get hit by the corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Where is it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Toula! Check your right! Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Nn?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Grraur!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Get lost, corrupted beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Toula!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Don't worry! I won't let them bring ruin to our world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Take this! Lighting of the Victorious Kingdom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Gyaahrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Commander! I did it! I got it with my Spirit Bonding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Toula! Get back! The corruption is not yet subdued!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Wha—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Wah! G-get off of me! N-no! Help me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Toula! Toula!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Aaaah! Nnngh...! Haaaaaargh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>I...was too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Grrr... Argh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Tch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Commander! T-Toula is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>I'll save you, Toula!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Stop! You can't help him now! You'll just end up like him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Toula... No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Grrraaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Toula...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Those who are touched by the corruption can never again be purified.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Kill him, Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>T-Toula can still be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>He is no longer the friend you remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>You know what you must do for him, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>I know. It is the way of our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Grrrrraaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Perish! "The fair will reach the foundation...to conquer it!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Grrrrr...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Forgive me, Toula.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Tree of life, Sephiron, I pray you, purify this soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>I must...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Nimul? Did you say something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Nothing. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>R-right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>(I must destroy this world.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>(This world has gone mad.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>(I will destroy the Truth of this world.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>May Sephiron's blessing of purification be upon the soul of Toula, the brave Sephira warrior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>(Perhaps it's because I haven't seen her in a while, but she seems more gaunt than before.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Lady Emmel, our Vessel of Purification, I thank you for the cleansing of our warrior's soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Though Toula had only recently joined the ranks of the guard, he valiantly defeated a corrupted beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>I see... Then it was a young citizen who became corrupted... How sad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Lady Emmel, please do not be disheartened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Thank you, Julia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>She's right, Emmel. It's not your fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>I know, Nimul. This is just how this world is. It's the law of the land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>We do not know when the misfortune of corruption will befall us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>But... Had I more power, I would be able to seal away and purify the corruption that bleeds out of the Cursed Beast that lies deep underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Emmel, you're doing just fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>You have nothing to worry about. You have nothing to regret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Nimul... Hrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Emmel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>I'm...fine, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Recently, she seems to be more exhausted than ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>It has been three years since the last Godwolf Ceremony. Her connection with Sephiron may be fading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>That could explain why we're seeing a rise in the number of corrupted beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>I won't have to hold out for much longer, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Yes, it's almost time for the Godwolf Ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Once you rekindle your bond with Sephiron, you should be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Emmel, please don't push yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Thank you, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>My lady, further exertion will affect your health. Please, let us retire so that you may rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>I suppose you're right, Lila. Please send word to Toula's family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Well, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Lord Nimul, our lady, the Vessel of Purification, needs her rest. Please take your leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>Is there anything else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>No. Let's go, Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>As you wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Oh, Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>I will return before the Godwolf Ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Yeah, I can't wait to spend some quality time with my sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>That's not what I mean. I'm talking about being here for your inauguration as chief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>Hah... I know, I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>But I am looking forward to spending some time at home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>Once my bond with Sephiron is rekindled, this village will be peaceful again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>Please protect the people until then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>Please be safe, Nimul... Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>We will be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>Julia, will you escort my brother and Waginau out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>It would be my pleasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>Tree of Life, Sephiron... Guardian Dragon Nidhogg... Please watch over our warriors and the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>Three years go by so fast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>Indeed. The corruption has become much more prevalent over time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>The area near Sephiron is untouched, but the further you get from her, less and less green can be seen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240</td>
<td>But it is as Lady Emmel said... We only need to endure a little longer until the Godwolf Ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>241</td>
<td>We must ensure that the coming Ceremony for the Godwolf succeeds without a hitch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>242</td>
<td>Not to mention, we will soon have a new chief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>243</td>
<td>True.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>244</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>245</td>
<td>The Vessel of Purification and the chief of the Sephira...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>246</td>
<td>Emmel and Nimul may yet subdue the corruption if they combine their forces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>247</td>
<td>Yes, I'm sure the village will see peaceful days again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>248</td>
<td>That should put my lady's mind at ease.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>249</td>
<td>Julia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>250</td>
<td>Y-yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>251</td>
<td>Please take care of Emmel. She tends to overdo things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>252</td>
<td>Of course! I will protect her with my life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>253</td>
<td>I'm counting on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>254</td>
<td>Lord Nimul...! Uhm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>255</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>256</td>
<td>Please, take care of yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>257</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>258</td>
<td>Y-you're destined to become the chief soon...so, uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>259</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>260</td>
<td>Now, please excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>261</td>
<td>Nimul? Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>262</td>
<td>On patrol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>263</td>
<td>Then allow me to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>264</td>
<td>No. I will go alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>265</td>
<td>What? Hey... Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>266</td>
<td>Well, this is just perfect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>267</td>
<td>What is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>268</td>
<td>I had thought he would start acting a little more responsibly now that he is to become the chief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>269</td>
<td>But he just goes off like that, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>270</td>
<td>Isn't patrolling through the village one of the chief's primary duties? It seems like he's trying to fulfill his responsibilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>271</td>
<td>Patrolling is just a front.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>272</td>
<td>Then what is he actually doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>273</td>
<td>He's meeting someone in secret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>274</td>
<td>In s-secret...?! Who?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>275</td>
<td>Nimul has a...a paramour? Is she...? Are they...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>276</td>
<td>Calm down, Julia. He's not meeting a woman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>277</td>
<td>O-oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>278</td>
<td>He's been having secret meetings with...the wanderer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>279</td>
<td>The...wanderer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>280</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>281</td>
<td>Fresh mountain cherries! Lovely and sweet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>282</td>
<td>How about some girak mushrooms? This year's harvest tastes richer than a king's ransom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>283</td>
<td>This meat wasn't hunted in a corrupted region, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>284</td>
<td>Of course not! I'd never sell something like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>285</td>
<td>(At first glance, it appears that the people are living peaceful lives here. However...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>286</td>
<td>Hey, did you hear? The corruption's gotten to the fields to the west...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>287</td>
<td>Yup. There won't be any more crops coming from out that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>288</td>
<td>Have you heard? Apparently, some corrupted fish have been spotted out in the lake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>289</td>
<td>You serious? Guess we can't fish there anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>290</td>
<td>(In reality, all of them are living in the shadow of the corruption, which has slowly but surely come to encroach upon their daily lives.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>291</td>
<td>(The corruption of the Cursed Beast threatens us all.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>292</td>
<td>(Not only that...)</td>

<td>Oh, you know... The wind blew me here. It's fickle like that.</td>

<td>379</td>
<td>The whimsy of the wind affects the flames of my forge and changes the moisture of the stones. It can even impact the blows of my hammer.</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Sorry to answer your question with a question, but... Aren't you at all curious about things you don't know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>386</td>
<td>I seek only to improve my arts and talent as a blacksmith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>387</td>
<td>That is all this world means to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>388</td>
<td>Hmm... Don't you think that by limiting yourself to this narrow corner of the world, your talents will eventually stagnate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>389</td>
<td>Smithing allows me to see much of the world. Through those who wield the arms and armor I forge... Through the earth that forms the ore I use...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>390</td>
<td>My world is expansive and has depths you cannot imagine. As I improve my talents, it grows and grows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>391</td>
<td>Experiencing the world through smithing, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>392</td>
<td>I guess that means you don't care about anything else, right? You're a strange one, I'll give you that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>393</td>
<td>It takes one to know one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>394</td>
<td>Still, it sounds like we have something in common. We share an inquisitive mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>395</td>
<td>Tch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>396</td>
<td>I want to know what lies outside of this village. I want to know about the other side of the shell that traps us here; about the sky that I can see, but never touch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>397</td>
<td>I want to know everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>398</td>
<td>And what will you do with that knowledge?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>399</td>
<td>I will remake the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>400</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>401</td>
<td>Yna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>402</td>
<td>Why are we born with the weight of sin upon our shoulders? Why must we suffer the corruption of sin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>403</td>
<td>I know of the seven sins committed by our ancestors, but we are not them. Why must we pay for their mistakes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>404</td>
<td>Why are their ancient sins forever ours to bear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>405</td>
<td>It is the way of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>406</td>
<td>I refuse to be chained by the sins of those long dead. I will carve out a new path in this world with my bare hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>407</td>
<td>For is that not the way this world should be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>408</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>409</td>
<td>So long as we are bound by this false world order, our suffering will continue for all eternity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>410</td>
<td>If we are ever to have any respite, we must shape the natural order of this world with our own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>411</td>
<td>What we need is a revolution. Do you not agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>412</td>
<td>You would go against the way of this world—against sin itself?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>413</td>
<td>Yes. I will release the people of this world from the burden of sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>414</td>
<td>Release them...from sin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>415</td>
<td>It must be done. If it is not...it will never end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>416</td>
<td>The Vessel of Purification will never be allowed to rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>417</td>
<td>But... How will you do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>418</td>
<td>The sins of humankind... The Cursed Beasts... They assail us with corruption from their realm beneath the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>419</td>
<td>There is nothing that can be done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>420</td>
<td>There is a way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>421</td>
<td>And I suppose you know of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>422</td>
<td>That is what I am currently researching. Once my efforts bear fruit, they will, without a doubt, make the revolution I envision possible. I will remake the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>423</td>
<td>If you can do it, so can I. I will make the impossible happen, just as you did when you came here, Yna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>424</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>425</td>
<td>Tell me. How did you get through the Dark Barrier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>426</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>427</td>
<td>Outside the bounds of the village of the Sephira, corruption wells up from beneath the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>428</td>
<td>All who touch it are corrupted, becoming the Fallen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>429</td>
<td>No one should be able to traverse that barrier, but somehow, you did, Yna... How?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>430</td>
<td>I...don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>431</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>432</td>
<td>I remember touching the corrupted surface of the Dark Barrier, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>433</td>
<td>I did not fall to sin, but awoke to find myself among the roots of the great tree herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>434</td>
<td>Was what I touched truly corruption? Or was it something else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>435</td>
<td>I have no answers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>436</td>
<td>I... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>437</td>
<td>(It might not have been corruption...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>438</td>
<td>(What else could it have been? Unless... Is there something we've misunderstood?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>439</td>
<td>Hey... Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>440</td>
<td>What is it? Did you remember something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>441</td>
<td>No... Look there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>442</td>
<td>There's something...outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>443</td>
<td>Oh, Nimul... Exactly how long are you planning on hiding out with that vagabond wanderer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>444</td>
<td>Was all that talk of becoming the village chief just that? Talk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>445</td>
<td>Wh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>446</td>
<td>Corruption?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>447</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>448</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>449</td>
<td>Grrrooooooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>450</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>451</td>
<td>Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>452</td>
<td>Nimul! Wanderer! Stay back, you fools!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>453</td>
<td>The corruption will take you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>454</td>
<td>I'm not going anywhere! I've got to get you out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>455</td>
<td>There are too many of them, Nimul. We're outnumbered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>456</td>
<td>Still, he needs our help... And I have a few blades I've been needing to test out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>457</td>
<td>Heh... Glad to have you by my side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>458</td>
<td>But these numbers won't be a problem for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>459</td>
<td>Have you finally lost your mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>460</td>
<td>Just watch and learn. I told you there's a way, didn't I?</td>
