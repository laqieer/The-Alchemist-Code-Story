<td>You finally came! I finally get to meet you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well then! Let's decide once and for all who the best twin sword fighter is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...Almira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh? ...Oh! Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm sorry. Do you think you can look after Kagura? She has a few deep wounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yauras...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Heheh. Are you trying to act tough? I'm sure you want to defeat me as well and gain the title of the best in the world, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>There's no sign that Greed Dike showed up in Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Most likely, they're headed towards Wratharis. Did you receive any word from Othima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No, not yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hey...are you listening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Um...are you sure you don't need to address her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...? Address who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Who? Um, she's been talking to you all this time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Heh. You're afraid to face me, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Who is that person?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm not sure what you mean by address her since I don't even know who she is. Oh...were you talking to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...!!! You scum...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>See? I don't have any acquaintances who use abusive words like "scum."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Aghhh! Get off your high horse! I'm taking you down, you little...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>How pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Y-you dodged it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If you're going to speak of beauty, then you should start by working on your vocabulary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Captain Yauras...you can see her movements?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Very impressive, Yauras. How noble of you to give advice to your enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...?! Ugff...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yauras...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ack! Wh-what the...?! I'm sure that I dodged it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh? Your complexion isn't looking very good. Now where did that look of confidence disappear to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So...you're not all talk, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Fine...come at me then. I'll take you on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Heheh. You're still just as arrogant as ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Try to ask nicely next time, you rude little tramp!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ack...?! She's fast?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You don't learn, do you? Did you think you dodged it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Agh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yauras!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Heheh! Hyahaha! What a wonderful moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The famous Yauras being carved by my blade...and kneeling pathetically!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's almost like a dream!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ugh...! Wh-why do you see me as your enemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Of course...you wouldn't remember me, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Have we met before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>In a small village in Wratharis. You...saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Saved you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You once saved a little band of thieves from the Wratharis soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The Wratharis soldiers were not necessarily in the wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>They found a small group of ruffians and, according to their law, were going to execute them. We were the ones that were obviously in the wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>"We"? You were one of the thieves then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>My father was a bandit. When I say bandit, he was weak, unresourceful, and a terrible father, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>At that time, he tried to run away and abandon me. He was caught by the Wratharis soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Was he executed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yes. All the other bandits were restrained along with myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The Wratharis soldiers, following their law, began the execution. I was ready to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>And Yauras showed up there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yes. Going against the tough soldiers, you said to them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>"What can they do to defend themselves? Put away your weapons."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Do you remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...I didn't think you would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But...I still remember you clearly in that moment like it was yesterday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Before the army troops, your strength never faltered. And you were breathtakingly beautiful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>My father had just been killed...and yet I found myself completely smitten by you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>If I had your strength I'm sure I would've been able to save my father...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I continued to hold a grudge against you for not having come to save us sooner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Meanwhile, on the other hand...I was filled with deep jealousy and envy for your beautiful figure. You continued to haunt me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Wait. What even is that?! Yauras didn't do anything wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Huh? What are you saying?! Being so beautiful and strong is sufficient enough of a sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...! You're twisted. You're so in love with Captain Yauras that it's warped your mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>In love?! Please, you must be joking! Why would I be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>If I had rushed there a little sooner...I could've saved you from your suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Huh?! Stop it!!! Don't say that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You...are the object of my hatred! You have to remain that way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I don't intend to flee from that responsibility, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>That doesn't mean I can let you and the others do what you're doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I cannot overlook what you people are doing...as a knight who lives in the name of absolute justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Heheh...! That's right! You've gotta be yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Come on...this is the moment I dreamed of! Yauras...I'm going to carve you up with my swords!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Yauras...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I can't afford to lose! I must avenge my lost friends as well!</td>
</tr>
