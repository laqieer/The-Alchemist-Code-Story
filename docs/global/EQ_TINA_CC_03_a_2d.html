<td>Miss Mocca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't worry, I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But...I'm the reason you got infected with the corruption. I'm so sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Don't say that, Tina. You have nothing to apologize for. As a matter of fact, I want to thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You saved Tamis for me. You saved Saga. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Mocca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Everything's fine now. Let's get back to the wind shrine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Mocca... What do you plan to do from now on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I figured that's what you wanted to talk about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I intend to leave Saga. I must find a cure for this curse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're...leaving?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I somehow knew you'd say that, but we can't even be sure if—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I know. There's no way of telling if there is even hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Truth be told, I'm scared. If I can never find a way to lift this curse, I'll...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Mocca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I may not even be able to see Saga in its former glory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Just thinking about that, I... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Mocca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah... Sorry. I don't mean to whine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I just don't want it to end like that. So I choose to leave Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm worried about Tamis, but I know that the Sprite Trio is at her side—not to mention Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So, Tina... I entrust Tamis to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, let's get back.</td>

<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's...nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We should get back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Miss Tina? Did you want to go with Miss Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No, that's not true. I am the Chief of the Toxotes tribe. I have duties and responsibilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Then why do you look so miserable?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm not. Let's go, Lisbeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Miss Tina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Just drop it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I... Sorry. I-I didn't mean to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'm sorry if I made you mad! I don't know what came over—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No, it's fine. I'm not angry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I just... I need you to fight me, right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Why? Why do we have to fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Just move your body! Get active! Wear yourself out until you can barely even think!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Whatever's left afterwards has got to be your truest feelings!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Stop! What is supposed to come of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You'll get over what's bearing down on you, Miss Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I... There's nothing—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I can tell! I've spent time with you, no matter how short it was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>So I won't hold back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>My friend is killing herself from the inside out! I can't just look away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...!</td>
