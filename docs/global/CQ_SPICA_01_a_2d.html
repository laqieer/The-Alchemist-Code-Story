<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Well, this has been a waste of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>My apologies, Sir Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No. It's not your fault, Spica.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>All the same, I'll make sure to do a thorough preliminary investigation next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>All right. That being said, that noble...who would've thought he was paying the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The Holy Order is rotten to its core, but the corruption of the nobles is a sight to behold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's just as you say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>In order to eliminate all of the corruption within this world, I must obtain absolute power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Absolute power...that none can challenge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(He's going mad...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(I owe so much to Sir Zahar...I respect and trust him.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(But...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(How long will I be able to stand by his side?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(No! I must not think such thoughts! My dedication to Sir Zahar is absolute!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...? Sir Zahar? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Come this way! Step right over here! We've got pieces from all across the world at discount prices!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...It looks like a pottery market.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'll take a look. It'll serve as a welcome distraction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Understood. Let's go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>There's no need for you to accompany me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What...no! If something were to happen to you... I will accompany you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>How about this over here? It's a celadon pot that originates from Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Good sir! Please, behold thisâ€”an ancient dish from Wadatsumi! Isn't it impressive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(Who would've thought that I'd get to spend such a quiet and tranquil time with Zahar like this?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>There's nothing that I'm drawn to yet, although I didn't have any expectations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Come step right up! Come step right up! Oh! Young mister and missus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I have a perfect tea cup set for the two of you! It's quite the masterpiece! Isn't it? What do you think?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Mi-mister and missus...?! How rude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Lord...Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Merchant, show me that squirrel figurine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ah! This over here?! You've got quite the eye, good sir! Here, here, do observe it carefully!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Spica, what do you think of this squirrel pottery?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I...don't know too much about pottery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It doesn't matter. Just tell me what you think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I think...it's cute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Heh. Cute, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(Oh...did Lord Zahar...just smile?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>This was made by a master craftsman in Envylia. Hey, merchant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Where did you obtain this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ah, a rich noble in Lustburg recently passed away and this was amongst his possessions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I see. It was in Lustburg...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>An arrow?! What is going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Bandits! Bandits are here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Bandits...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(Just when I was getting to spend time with Lord Zahar!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Now who gave you lot permission to do business here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Indeed, the craftsmanship is wonderful. The delicacy of colors is quite different when it comes to a master's work...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Whoa! Young sir, there are bandits here! Now isn't the time for such leisure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Lord Zahar, what shall we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...Merchant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yes...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'll purchase this later. Protect it at all costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>U-understood...hey, hold on! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Spica, let's get rid of these pests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
