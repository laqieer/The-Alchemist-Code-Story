<td>002</td>
<td>Chihaya...are you talking the priestess from Wadatsumi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hmph. So you finally remembered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wait! Was she killed? Th-that priestess?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Enough with your mocking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I am well aware that you used the blade of that knife to end the life of Chihaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's nonsense! I was making my way to go save her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Why would I kill the woman who I tried desperately to rescue?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I monitored your movements, and now I finally know the answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You killed Chihaya in order to obtain the Mikaboshi, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Chihaya was the priestess that was leading Wadatsumi's reconstruction into the next age. She was deeply trusted by her people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>However...for someone who was aiming to take the Mikaboshi...which can be called the treasure of Wadatsumi, she wouldn't be anything but an obstacle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Idiot! What proof do you have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...This.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Is that the coatÂ of arms for the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yes. It was left behind after Chihaya's assassination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If you're going to talk about the Code of Chivalry then why don't you admit it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You killed Chihaya. You pretended to help her, and when she let her guard down...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Did you pretend to help her in order to smoothly implement the assassination?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Or does that also happen to be a strategy that I haven't been told of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The nape of your neck is wide open, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You're not gonna even turn to look?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What's going on? Is the truth I know...the real truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You...that aura...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Fine then,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No matter what I say, if you can't believe my words, then come and attack. I don't haven't time to waste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You imbecile...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Take this...Steel Cutting Blade!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...behind you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>These two swords will truly sever your breath! Begone! Steel Cutting Flash!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...?! ...Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>U-ugff...! Wh-what the...?! Aghh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's over. You chose the wrong opponent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Heh...heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What's so funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I was just contemplating how pathetic of an end this is. I couldn't even save her...and now I'm going to die here like a dog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Her...? Now that I think about that, I don't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Why would a professional assassin like you wield your sword for a dead woman? Were you in love with Chihaya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wh-who knows...but...I-I know that...at least, I'm grateful to her...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Grateful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes. In the past, I was responsible for the restoration of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I took on the job of assassinating Chihaya's predecessor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Things went smoothly without a hitch, except for the unexpected fact that Chihaya had seen me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>How is that connected with gratefulness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>When you've been in this business for awhile, you'll encounter times when people see you at the crime scene.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>At times like that, the ways that such an eyewitness can respond are pretty much pre-determined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>They'll either frantically flee, beg for their life, or attempt to retaliate violently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>And the priestess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>She didn't fit in any of those boxes. She wasn't scared, instead, she asked me questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>She couldn't understand why someone from Wadatsumi would kill another person from Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Heheh. I was the one the one who was perplexed...unable to find any reply to her question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It's not just what was in front of her. She was looking far into the future...to the country of Wadatsumi itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>For better or for worse, she brought me back to my own way of living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What I was living for...my goals in life and how I was going to pursue them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Her direct gaze was enough to make me determined. Before I knew it, that was my goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>True. If you asked me if I was in love with her, I would say you might be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But...she was suddenly eradicated...because of your greed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It all came about because of your lack of power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yes. Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I could neither save her nor was able to get revenge. In fact, I have no thing left to live for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Come on...kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You're wasting your time. I don't have time to take you on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What...what do you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Nothing. Just going on a whim. I know the same sensation of not being able to protect those that you love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>No, even now, I am placed in that situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>This time, I will save her with my own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I don't have time to be taking care of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>If you let me live, I'll attack you again. You'll regret it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Do as you please. At that time, I'll once again overwhelm you with my power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Tsk...that imbecile...</td>
</tr>
