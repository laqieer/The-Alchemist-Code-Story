<td>Dang it! We've got to do something quick! Otherwise...Saga will be...</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Its stomach glows green whenever it's about to let loose its fire. I think it might need to gather energy before it can breathe fire... Maybe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How about its abdomen...? It used to be a mountain... Wait! That's it! Its back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I agree. However, we are one person short...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Its back?! Mocca, can you let us in on what you've come up with?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The dragon's abdomen glows green before it breathes fire, right? Well, the core could be in its belly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The dragon was originally a mountain, which means it must have a strong underside like the base of a mountain. We should climb onto its back and strike at it from there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wouldn't it be better to aim for its stomach, rather than its back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No, it wouldn't be safe. Look at the way it's moving. We could be crushed if we aimed for its stomach. Cutting open its back, on the other hand, would open a path for us to reach its stomach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It is the closest point to its core and where we would encounter the least danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The core's in its stomach, huh? But how are we supposed to cut open its back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We do it with the Dragonslayer, of course. Isn't that right, Georgios?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Indeed. However, unless we learn to fly, we'll never be able to make it to its back from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lilith's Hill is high above the ground. If we go there, we might have a chance of reaching its back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well done; you've managed to come to the same conclusion as me, but how do you expect to lure the dragon all the way to Lilith's Hill? We're missing a valuable individual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tina, Mocca, Tehre! You're all okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Rega! Kiki, too! And Adel and Leoferes! What are you all doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Graah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We were evacuating all of the animals in the forest when we saw you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's it! With Leoferes, Kiki, and Adel, we can make it to the dragon's back without needing to go via up Lilith's Hill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Indeed. We should be able to climb up its back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>And someone could ride Leoferes and lure the dragon to Lilith's Hill. This is starting to look like a real plan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'll lend a hand, too! Just tell me what you need me to do. You'll help us, too, won't you, Kiki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Raawr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Look out! Fire incoming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ack! We've got to hurry! What the?! The dragon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It stopped?!</td>
