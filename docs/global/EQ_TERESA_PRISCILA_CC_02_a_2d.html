<td>Prince</td>
<td>I commend your persistence, but I think it's time you took a break, Kalmia. You're clearly overexerting yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Thank you for your concern, but I'm quite all right. I shan't whinge over such trifles as this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>I must remain strong. I have to repay my mentor for raising me after I lost my father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prince</td>
<td>Hmm. Well, that look on your face certainly will never do. You need to be a bit softer around the edges when you're with the troops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Pardon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prince</td>
<td>Emotions are contagious, both positive and negative. They spread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prince</td>
<td>If you hate, all you receive is hate in return. If you rage, all you see is anger from those around you. It's a never-ending cycle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>So, are you telling me I...shouldn't hate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prince</td>
<td>Don't get me wrong, I completely understand the sheer anger and frustration you must feel when seeing helpless people unreasonably abused and exploited in the chaos of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prince</td>
<td>I can't stand to see it either. That's why I fight. I'm not as skilled as you are, but I do know my way around a spear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prince</td>
<td>Still, I always strive never to fight in the name of hatred. A vengeful mind is a blinded one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prince</td>
<td>Nothing remains after a battle predicated on hatred. Your spear will only bring with it more hatred and vengeance. It will see the cycle continue far beyond its means, and no one will win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Then what must I fight for? What do you think of when you fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prince</td>
<td>That's simple. I fight to bring an end to war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prince</td>
<td>If there are no wars, we can all live in peace. Maybe we'd even have enough time to stop and smell the flowers.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Such an innocent idealist, brought up sheltered, never having lost anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>And yet, there was a certain...matter-of-factness to his words, a certain power to them, that made his point seem almost self-evident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>He was sagacious and popular. He even had the courage to stand on the front lines of battle in an effort to end the war himself. I... No, all of us... We saw a very bright future in him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Which is why I chose to carry on his ideals. I swore I'd never let them be clouded by hatred again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>I keep my eyes averted from the boiling darkness I've sealed away deep within me.</td>

<td>Come on out. You desperately need more training in stealth, Priscilla.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>Was it that bad? Was I that obvious?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Oh, um, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>That battle the other day... You were like a whole different person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Dear me! Were you worried?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>Absolutely! You're a big part of my life, Kalmia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>Father trained us both in the way of the spear, and raised us like sisters. You're practically family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>I'm sorry to have caused concern. I just couldn't help getting involved, knowing what a hard time the Ruinmaker once gave you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>But, you were—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Envylia suffered great loss back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>And the Ruinmaker's active participation on the battlefield was a direct cause of that loss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>She is a great threat to us. So, if we were to successfully take her out of the equation, it would be a great stride toward ending this war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>I think I was rapt with that idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>That...wasn't how I saw it, though. You seemed so unlike your usual self, Kalmia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Really? I suppose getting flustered is not a good look for me. I'll try to be more careful in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Come to think of it, I have a few things to say to you, too, Priscilla. I hear you charged ahead blindly, ignoring your commanding officer's orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>Er, I... I just got so fired up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Then in the midst of battle, you lost your footing for a moment. Don't think I didn't notice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>Oh, yes. A-about that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>I saw a pretty flower, and...I-I didn't want to step on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>You were worried about a flower? In the midst of combat?! If that's true, you have much more control over your nerves than you give yourself credit for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>Thank you! I promise I'll dodge any such flowers more adeptly next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>That's...not exactly what I was trying to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>But... Heh. You have always loved flowers, I suppose! Some things never change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>It's a commendable and quite rare quality to be able to notice and care for such little things that would otherwise be overlooked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>Y-you really think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>I do. And I've been with you for so long, I think you can trust my judgment on that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>I find that part of you quite...precious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>And I very much hope you never let it wilt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>Kalmia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>But! You have to know how dangerous such actions are in battle. You could've been killed! Your kind truly isn't suited to the front lines. I do wish you'd reconsider your participation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>This dusty old topic again? Why are you always trying to convince me to step away?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>You, more than anyone, should know how capable I am with my spear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Well, I certainly can't deny that. I've watched you grow next to me as we trained together. But in a way, that's all the more reason for concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>You may be skilled in practice, but the battlefield is nothing like the training hall. The enemy isn't about to give the slightest consideration for your tenderness toward flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>S-sure, but—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Like our mentor, you can be of use to the military simply by training other soldiers in the ways of the spear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>You don't need to risk your life in the battlefield proper on top of that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>Well, that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>I just don't want to see the living memory of my mentor perish before her time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>But, I know death is never far off when I stand on the battlefield. I've already come to terms with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>Moreover, I promised Father that I'd carry on his will. So I can't just leave the fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Kalmia. No matter what you or anyone else says, I have to do this. It's important that I—</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/pris.png" alt="Priscilla" height="128"><br>Priscilla</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>I swear, she's like a whirlwind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>I definitely messed up today, though. I shouldn't make her worry like that. I need to be more mindful.</td>
</tr>
