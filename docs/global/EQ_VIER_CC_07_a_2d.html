<td>Let me sleep.</td>

<td>014</td>
<td>A clean way to die, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Death is death. There's nothing nice or clean about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A pure, sinless life is nothing but a dream. That's just wasted breath.</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No one consciously makes a decision to live a bad life.</td>

<td>Wishing for a nice future, predicting such a thing and waiting tens of hundreds of years for it to come true...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>For the day there is no more struggle, no more suffering. The day I don't dread what might come tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>My days have been haunted by that waking dream of such a life. The years have passed as I lost myself to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But no matter how far I go to try to escape it, I hate my race, I hate myself, I hate the future, and I hate the past.</td>

<td>There is only punishment waiting around every corner, every turn in the road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>All that lives on forever is the sin I carry of having tricked you! If putting me to sleep is an execution, then do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tell me! What kind of teacher even are you if you can't even tell me where I can sleep?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Holding onto vast dreams will only crush you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I've had many dreams, and abandoned them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The fulfillment of even the smallest dream is a combination of joy and sorrow.</td>

<td>After so long, the desire to sleep long and deep...</td>

<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Is that so wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>No.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>When you struggle to sleep, the night air assaults your skin, does it not? As it does me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Your sheets stick to you, clinging and suffocating, trapping all your feverish heat...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So you get out of bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You start to think, "Maybe I'll just stay up until dawn."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I've slept and woken like this for hundreds of years... Repeating the same cycle every night, thousands or tens of thousands of times...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Then you must be tired of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It was the same for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Sleeping forever means never waking. It means never living again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Never...living...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What a terrible memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We should make it nicer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Waking is awful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hey...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'm not good at figuring things out, like a young girl blinded by hazy dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm sick of brushing off bad dreams and trying to forge on with positivity and optimism.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'm just waiting for the poison to lead me to my death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I close my eyes, thinking that if I can't die today, I might tomorrow.</td>
