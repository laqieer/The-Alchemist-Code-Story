<td>Oh man... I keep wracking my brains, but I just can't figure it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Still, I can't afford not to, not with the Holy Guard backing me. I owe them some results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This must be Rosa's place. Could he really be here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I mean, how does a guy from Wadatsumi end up all the way out here in Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hello? Anyone home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Greetings, madam. How may I help you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hi! I'm Judith. I sent word that I'd be coming to consult Eizan regarding a...personal matter. Is he here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ah, Miss Judith! We've been expecting you. Follow me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hmm... Seems I've exhausted the potential of this compound. If I could get my hands on some of that ore, instead...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes... I think that's just what I need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This is incredible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt. I just got lost in your craftsmanship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>And who might you be? Have you got a commission for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Not exactly. My name is Judith. I've come to ask you for some help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is that so? Come to think of it, I did hear somebody would be coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So what's this all about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I guess you could say I need some advice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I've been working with the Holy Guard to develop weaponized mechas, called mech gears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The idea is to create a weapon strong enough to protect everyone in the world. A mech gear that can bring about world peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But...I'm stuck. I'm not exactly a weaponsmith myself, so I was hoping to get some advice from a professional in that field. From you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Why me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Because in my eyes, there's no one better. I've seen some of your work before, and they were hands down the greatest weapons I'd ever handled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So I figured if anyone could help me through this slump, it'd be you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Very well. Let's see this mech gear of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>R-right! Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So...you're looking for advice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Come. Spar with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The best way to tell what a tool is worth is to use it for its intended purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If this thing's the weapon you claim it is, then prove it. Show me what it can do in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>And while you're at it, show me your conviction as its creator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>M-my...conviction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If you aren't prepared to do so, then you might as well turn around and head back the way you came.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No, I am! I'll do it! I'll show you what my mech gear can do!</td>
