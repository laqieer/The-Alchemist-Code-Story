<td>Huzzahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>So it's true... Our Spiritbonding and the powers of purification have weakened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It must be because Sephiron has been consumed by the corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The power of the Sephira people is nothing less than the blessing of Sephiron. We are only able to cleanse ourselves of corruption because of our connection to the source: the great tree itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh?! Does that mean Waginau is as useless as a bag of rocks right now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Listen here you little imp! I am the Captain of the Sephira Guard! My training has not been so pitiful that something as trivial as this could slow me down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That being said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Regular Sephira warriors will likely struggle to go up against the corrupted beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We cannot afford to count them among our number in our hunt for the fallen dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm afraid I have to agree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Beelzebub's miasma has already begun encroaching upon the land around Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>At this rate, it's unlikely that the soldiers will be able to get the villagers to safety in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No problem! We'll just leave some of my Engineer Soldiers behind to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We can't. We will need every last one of your Soldiers to go up against the fallen dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Especially considering the state of our warriors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But, then... What are you saying? We can't just abandon them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Of course we can't. There is, however, something we can afford to abandon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>A-abandon the village?! Begging your pardon, Chief...but have you lost your mind?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No... I can assure you that my senses haven't left me yet. We are no longer under Sephiron's protection, and the Cursed Beast is on the brink of awakening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I want to save as many lives as I possibly can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>S-still, Chief...the Cursed Beast will follow us wherever we go! That's the way of—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I have no intention of resting on my laurels and waiting for the advent of my own destruction. I will reclaim Sephiron for our people. I'm just going to need some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You know that there's a place to the south of this region where Sephiron's protection has always been weak...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You mean that barren wasteland that was swallowed up by a sandstorm or some such?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The reason that the fallen dragon fled to the Great Forest of Suga might not have been entirely because of Emmel's prayers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm thinking that the corruption prefers to devour the most vibrant and lively regions first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh! S-so, if we flee to the sands in the south...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You'll be safe from the corruption...at least for a little while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>In the meantime, we will work to grant the last oracle of the Great Dragon Nidhogg and seal the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I understand, Chief. I'll talk to the other villagers, make them see the right of it, and then we'll all start heading south.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The last oracle of the Great Dragon... Cleverly put, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It's not a lie. In fact, it's unavoidable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If we abandon the village... One day, we will lose access even to our Spiritbonding powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We have some time before then, and if I can complete my new technique...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Anyone will be able to wield those powers, just as we do now. No—they will be even more powerful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Spiritbonding will no longer be limited to the roots of Sephiron. It will spread across the entire world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Then, and only then, will the Sephira finally be able to break free of the All Mother's cradle... Fly the nest, so to speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Wouldn't you agree, Waginau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But it... It would not be the blessing of Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I see... You're still conflicted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I... I have never viewed the way of the world so negatively as you, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It might have burdened us with our sins; it might have meant that we had to suffer a terrible punishment... But under the protection of Sephiron, we were able to live in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That is why I cannot fathom... Why is this happening? Why does it have to be like this? Where did we go wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>So...I do agree. There is nothing else we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>As the Captain of the Sephira Guard, I will do all I can to save as many lives as possible. To that end...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I will do anything it takes. Yes... Even if I must commit the taboo of slaying our Guardian Dragon, I will reconcile myself with the burden of that sickening sin!</td>
