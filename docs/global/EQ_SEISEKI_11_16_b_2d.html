<td>Right!</td>

<td>Plasma Burst!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa... Heh, too bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Pathetic. You're nowhere near as threatening as you were earlier. Looks like you're headed to the afterlife, not the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Urgh! Shut your mouth! You think I'm done?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah, I do. I'm putting an end to this myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Captain Kudan, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There's an ominous dark wind circling around him! You shouldn't get too close!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Sol's body is glowing? What is he about to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You have all been nuisances for long enough! Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Whoa! Everybody, get ready to defend yourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wrong, Basheeny. This is exactly when we should attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What?! D-do you have a plan?! Not only do physical attacks not harm him, but he can break himself out of your spells!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I might. As we've already seen, a simple attack is not enough to damage him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>However, there is no way a person can bulk up the protection they have inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>In...side?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yep. I call it: The Lightning Rod Strategy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You plan to funnel magic directly into his internal organs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You are a sharp one, Captain Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>How do you intend to accomplish this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Right, so...that's the biggest problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>For this to work, someone is going to have to thrust a weapon of some sort into his flesh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>While dodging his powerful swings, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What are you all prattling on about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It doesn't matter what your plan is! I will rend you all into bloody, dripping shreds and glory in it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Whoa, that was...visceral. That guy is super scary! I didn't know I could still get goosebumps like this as a Phantom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Th-there is no time to be scared! How are we going to put this plan into action?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The plan? The key agent for this mission is already on the move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The key agent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yes. He took action before I even explained the details to him. I envy you for having such an excellent retainer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Who...? Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I am going to tear into your body and shred your flesh to strips! Let me see your blood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Urgh! Why, you little...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I did it! Captain Vettel! Look, I stabbed him! You shouldn't have underestimated the Scarlet Flame Guard, you gorilla!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Tch! You little brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Urgh?! Why, you—! Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I shouldn't have expected any less from the famed Scarlet Flame Guard. You did well too, Basheeny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You've made your teacher proud. I can leave the future in your hands with confidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Y-you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I can understand what you and your friends are going through, but the beliefs you hold dear will never be compatible with this world. I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You've caused too much trouble among the living. You will be able to riot to your heart's content in the world of the dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Neun! Get out of there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Absolute Zero!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Grraaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Neun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Nng! Ugff! You...bastards...always making us into...outcasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Are we not...e-even allowed to...pursue...the sky we dreamed of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>S-Sol, please... K-kill these bastards... Set...L-Lost Blue...free. Grrraaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>We did it! B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>This...doesn't feel...right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>If you think of all the casualties he caused and victims he left behind, his actions were irredeemable, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>He was acting on his own ideas of justice. That's no small thing. We shouldn't just let it fade away. Do you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yes, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Unforgivable...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Those who hurt one of our own must be annihilated. That is our code!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I am going to kill you all! I will slaughter every single one of you, no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>The dark wind within Sol is surging even stronger than before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>No! Sol, you can't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Love can be a strength, but in the same vein, it can also become a weakness. The person I yearn for taught me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Allowing love to be your priority will interfere with your concentration. I was once told that it is better to discard affection if it becomes blind love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Lord Zahar, I now know that you were expressing your concern for me with those words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Grk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Acht!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Nn...ngh! T-take it back! You dare...s-say my affection...for S-Sol is my...weakness?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I-if you intend...to ridicule my feelings—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>No, please understand. I am envious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>En...vious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Yes, I am. I envy you for being able to blindly devote yourself to the one you care for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I can never again meet the person I wish to devote myself to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Those left alive must accept the death of those who are gone, but there is no feat more agonizing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>There are times I wish I had followed him to the other side, but I cannot muster the courage to make that choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>To be honest, I don't know what the right thing to do is anymore. I am so lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>The honesty of your devotion will surely reach his heart, unlike mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>That precious soul of yours will surely accompany his to the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Acht!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>The...s-sky we chased after...f-for so long... I-it's fading...but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>My soul...will n-never stop...following you. P-please keep me b-by your side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Of course I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Nng! I...am s-so glad to...have been...w-with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Acht!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I am glad to have been allowed to bear witness to your passion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Spica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>You're the only one left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Even you cannot defeat us all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>We will stop you before you do something that can't be undone. That's the least I can do as someone who shares the same hometown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>What do you mean "before"?! He's already caused so much damage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>You'll atone for everything you've done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>You've brought terror into the lives of the people of Babel, and caused substantial harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>As the Lord Commander, the keeper of the peace, I cannot forgive you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>What do have you to say for yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Hmph. You don't even have the strength to talk back, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Vier... Füry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>What is he...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Sieba... Zehn... Neun... Acht...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>No... The dark wind within Sol is getting stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>This is an unexpected turn of events. I don't think our dreams are going to come true on this day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>But I can fulfill one last promise to you. These bastards who took your lives... I will slaughter every single one of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Here he comes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Hrgh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I will end it all here. Beg for forgiveness from those friends of mine who you have condemned to the afterlife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>He's...so fast! I-I can't see him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Th-there's not even time for me to try to sense his presence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>This is a bit of a pickle. We need to think of something, quick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>There is nothing you can do! The next strike will be the end of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Seriously?! Can't you give me a little time to think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Haha...hahahaha... I forgot to mention how I hate being alone. I'll have you all follow me to hell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Y-you have to be kidding me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>He's... He's going to use all of his remaining power in this one moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>You mean...self-destruct?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Kudan, can you still fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>If that man intends to self-destruct, then we have to take him out with one swift blow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>You and Kanon, the two with the most remarkable offensive capabilities, are the only ones we can trust with this task.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>I agree that this is the most pragmatic option. Do you think you're up for it, Kanon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Of course! I can't just stand around and do nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I guess that would be the only option. Can you do it, Captain Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>All right, then! Let's go out with a bang!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Oh no! His energy is rising at an incredible rate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I'll draw his attention! Seida, can you pinpoint the source of his dark wind?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Yes... We'll have to aim for the core of his energy! Let's go, Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Wow, they make a great team! Well, I guess this leaves me with only one job left to do. Hey, Kagura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>I know what you're thinking! Kudan, we're counting on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Captain Vettel! What can we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Their teamwork is flawless. If we were to try anything, we'd just be getting in their way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Tch! So we can only stand by and watch?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Kanon, you've got this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Hmph! No matter what you may be plotting, it is too late!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Isn't that right, Captain Yauras?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>He figured out our plan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>You just don't learn, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>What?! Where did she go?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>It would be wise to remember that there is not a single captain of the Holy Guard that does not know how to learn from their past experiences!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Immortal Rose!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Agh! Nngh! Y-you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Seida!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I see it! The source of his dark wind... The core of it is in his solar plexus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>You're all dead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>H-his energy... It's surging through him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Everybody, get down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Burn! All of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>What? Why did nothing happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>H-hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>I-I can't hold it...for long!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Redhead! Tch! Dang you for using your phoenix to suppress the blast! Again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Heartbreaking Arrow!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Nngh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Got him! That one definitely pierced his core!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Urgh! Y-you lot think this...will kill me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Not yet, of course. Seida, thanks for getting the lightning rod where it needs to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>What are you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>I'm sorry to inform you, but we'll be draining off some more of your power... Ill Atmosphere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Gh... Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>The turbulent wind within him stopped! It's frozen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Thank you, everybody. I will not let this chance go to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Eternal Glow!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>We got him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Wait! No, not yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Ug...ugff...! I-I am...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>I am...the light. The sun...of Lost Blue... I... I cannot go down...like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>H-how?! His dark wind is billowing again?! Kanon! Hit him again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>I'll s-say it again. I am the sun...that will lead...this world into a...n-new era. It doesn't matter how many of you there may be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>However, there is one thing I must say on their behalf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Wh-wha...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
