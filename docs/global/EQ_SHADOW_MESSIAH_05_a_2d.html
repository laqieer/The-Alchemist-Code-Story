<td>H-how's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's actually really good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You mean it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Really?! No way! Let me try some!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Umgf! Mmff... Umgf... Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This is good! Really, really good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hey! Save some for me! Umgf! Mmff... Umgf... Hrmpf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Mm-mmm! This is great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I finally did it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What's going on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>L-Lord Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You've been gone for quite a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Don't worry, I didn't forget you. I come bearing gifts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What's that you're making, Spica? Have you been cooking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Not... exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Did you make this, Spica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Y-yes, my lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Mind if I try some? It's been a long day, and I'm hungry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>P-please do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Lord Zahar—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I never expected to find Spica cooking—but I suppose this, too, is a form of change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Is it a bad thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>There's no need to consider that right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Spica is finally ready to carry our will into the new world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Good, or bad—that is not for us to determine. Everything will be decided under the new order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>As you say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Nonetheless, this is good progress. Oh, and Corvus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You've done well in my absence. I trust I can count on you again if a similar situation arises in the future?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Of course, my lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Lord Zahar? The preparations—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Are you happy with your decision to leave Corvus in charge of the Shadow Messiah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I am. He did very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Truly? I'm glad to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>As members of the Shadow Messiah, Corvus and Spica will be the ones to guide us into the new world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes, well—as I was saying, the preparations are complete. You'd better eat up before your darling prodigy's cooking gets cold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm starving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Eep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>There's nothing to worry about, Spica! You trained so hard for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I-I know, but... I can't help feeling nervous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>How is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It's delicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>R-really?! I'm so glad to hear that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Spica.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes, my lord?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I look forward to trying more of your cooking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Thank you! I won't let you down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Phew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huh? Why were you all tensed up, Corvus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I wasn't—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I mean... It's only natural for a teacher to be concerned about the results of his pupils' training, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Oh. Uh... I guess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Psst! Isn't Corvus acting kind of weird?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Yeah! Something's definitely up with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>By the way, Lord Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Isn't it about time you told us where you went and what you were doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Take a look at this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Isn't this... that stone we found in the Holy Order facility?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>There's something... not quite right about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>This is an Obsidian Star. It's a mutated variant of Sephirium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Sephirium?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Huh? What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It's a legendary ore—well, actually, it would be more accurate to call it resin. In other words, hardened sap—and taken from the great tree, Sephiron, no less.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It's supposed to be harder than any metal smelted from common ore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>While Obsidian Stars aren't as hard as pure Sephirium, they're the next best thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I used these Obsidian Stars to forge each of us a unique suit of armor of the highest quality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>A-armor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>With this done, we will have in our hands one of the immense powers that will enable us to annihilate the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Go on. Take them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Thank you, my lord!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Wh-what's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Lord Zahar! What is the meaning of—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>This is corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Corruption?! Ugh! It's all over me! Get it off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You must endure! Swallow the corruption before it swallows you! Claim our greatest weapon, the Final Battle Armaments, for your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You want us to... take in the corruption?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Yes! You must! Show me the strength of your wills!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Overcome it! Overcome yourselves!</td>
</tr>
