<td>Hey!</td>

<td>What were you just doing?</td>

<td>Just getting rid of monsters. It's our mission to protect the farm, remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But none of those monsters were even approaching the farm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yet you went out of your way to attack them, and even hunted down the ones that were running away. That's not how security is meant to act.</td>

<td>Is everything all right, Itsuki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ugh! What is with this feeling?! I hate it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Why should I have to be friendly to humans just because I'm a Phantom now?! They've been nothing but cruel to me!</td>
