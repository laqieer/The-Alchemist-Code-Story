<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Heheh. What's the matter? Are you upset because things didn't go as planned?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's just that...I assumed we would be hampered, but I never expected Monzein to prevent us from obtaining Leviathan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Monzein the Great Thunder Axe, huh? A man who was worthy of his title as Captain of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Having been able to engage with him in battle is one of the greatest rewards we could've asked for. We should be grateful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Perhaps I should reflect on having underestimated Monzein's strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>However, we succeeded in draining Leviathan of its power. Thus, everything is going exactly according to plan. Wouldn't you agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Indeed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>First the Mikaboshi and then the Sacred Stone Leviathan...there's no doubt that we're one step closer to collapsing the balance of power in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Already, the Mikaboshi has lost its potency.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>In other words...currently, the balance of power in Babel is being maintained by the seven Sacred Stones held by their respective countries. And...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The Philosopher's Stone Matter in the Saga region. If we can take a majority of those and drain them of their power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It is obvious that the equilibrium in this world will collapse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Mammon; the Sacred Stone that belongs to our country...and Leviathan; Envylia's Sacred Stone which is now empty of its power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Then if we add the two Sacred Stones that currently exist in Northern Pride, that will be half of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Thus...regarding the Sacred Stones in Wratharis, Slothstein, and Lustburg, whose location is unknown to us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Worst case scenario, there is no need for us to obtain them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>However...that only applies under the assumption that Gluttony Foss' Sacred Stone Beelzebub is held by Captain Seida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>With somebody as calm, careful, and clever as her...I wonder how long she can remain without changing its whereabouts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Unfortunately, regardless of how extensively we searched for its location, we have yet been unable to discern its location. My deepest apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Do not fret. In any case, once Norther Pride collapses, we will find out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Either way, in order to guarantee success, we must obtain Saga's Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Kudanstein...who fell into darkness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Even if he were to return to this world, if we can at least obtain the majority of the Sacred Stones within this world, we have nothing to be afraid of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Kudanstein...? Hmph. What about him is there to be afraid of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I cannot believe that anyone other than myself can obtain Nimul's power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I know that you also understand that well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Certainly. I was overthinking matters. With Wadatsumi's queen now dead...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>There is no longer anyone who can prevent fate from taking its course. All of this has been decided...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>From your birth, Your Majesty was destined to wield the power of Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Continue to sit on the throne and it will cause a wound. That wound will eventually infect the world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...! Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You were wise to attack Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The Holy Guard was unable to grasp our movement...and have now sent out troops to Wratharis, Slothstein, and Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You...! Look at you nonchalantly making your way back here now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Nonchalantly? There are those amongst my kind who dislike being used by you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>In a short period of time, I've appeased them and placed them strategically in various countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Shouldn't you be showering me with words of appreciation now instead of complaints?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Enough, Waginau... Thank you, Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Uncovering the symbolic artifacts scattered through this world while remaining in Greed Dike...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>True, your original strategy was certainly a surprising one. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It was a plan that a decent tactician would be able to eventually uncover.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>But who of your foe would actually expect you to move in the most orthodox of manners?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>In other words, instead of being counterintuitive, act on standard intuition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Your advice reminds of how I was once drowning in strategies and tactics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Your Majesty...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The fact is that the Holy Guard is currently in a situation where they have no choice but to send troops to each country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>One of the reasons why I called on the Templars is because it allows me to act in ways that they cannot predict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That strategy has been quite successful. In fact, I am quite pleased.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Heheh. Well then, how should I move next, my young strategist?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Your first move against Envylia has already caused the world to reel in shock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>From here on you may move however you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What nonsense...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>If we move the main army, they'll pick up on it. It'll defeat the whole purpose of having confused them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Honestly. Why do you think I got here this late?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>All you need to do is create a situation that will keep the Holy Guard headquarters' attention away from your movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I've already come up with a plan. You just need to fortify your position, Emperor Orion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>My Lady! It's terrible! The Greed Dike army...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I heard that they appeared suddenly! What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'm not sure! In any case, there's a vast number of them. They should even be visible from here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Seida!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Wh-what is that...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It's almost as if the horizon has been painted black!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It can't be! Are those all Greed Dike soldiers?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>We've no time to be surprised! Kanon, you command the attack! I'll go warn the palace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I'll make my way to the frontline...excuse me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ack! Seida's right...I can't hesitate now! Commander Zain...Captain Monzein...witness my actions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>By our hands, we will protect the peace of this world!</td>
</tr>
