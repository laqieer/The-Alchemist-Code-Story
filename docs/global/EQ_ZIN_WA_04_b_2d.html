<td>That being said, there are strange traditions and laws in this country.</td>

<td>Not allowing strangers in where thereÂ are sick people...</td>

<td>I wonder if the law really is more important than the lives of the sick...</td>

<td>What are you saying all of a sudden?</td>

<td>008</td>
<td>Having been outside this country, that is what I thought. Abroad...especially in the Desert Zone where you come from, I found freedom.</td>

<td>This country...does not have the same freedom that others do.</td>

<td>010</td>
<td>Are you sure? Other countries are constantly at work and I don't think they have as much freedom as you say they do.</td>

<td>Really?</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes...I'm sure. I obtained the medicine to cure Demon's Blood. That's why I returned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But I also returned to fight one more thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>To fight? Fight what? Sickness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That too...but that's not what I'm talking about. I came here to fight myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I ran away from the law here...and from my sister.</td>
