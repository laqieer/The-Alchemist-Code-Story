<td>...So that's everything we know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The delivery person was attacked by a monster!? That's terrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But they weren't hurt. They just had their packages stolen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hmm, well it's certainly strange. A monster attacking someone not for food, but for holiday decorations?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No kidding... The packages just had the decorations, some ornaments, and other holiday stuff. What interest would a monster have in things like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...What is it, Rochelle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What's wrong? You're just staring into space. Are you upset about the decorations?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't feel bad. It's not your fault. Besides, there's nothing we can do about it anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Or...is it something else? You know you can tell me anything, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Come on, don't give me that. I can tell when something's bothering you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You worry too much. I'm fine. Really. Besides, our mission is going fine. There's nothing wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ishi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...You just won't tell me anything, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...Forget it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hey, it looks like the festivities are beginning. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yeah, the snow sculpture contest should be starting soon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Speaking of which, do you think that man ever finished his sculpture?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I wonder...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey! Security!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>! W-what's wrong!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Have you seen my son!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I-I was so intent on finishing the sculpture before the deadline.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But then when I looked up, he was gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What!? Oh no! Where could he have gone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>He special ordered the decorations from a famous craftsman who lives in the forest. "I'll make the perfect snow sculpture! Just you watch!" he said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...! You don't think...he went looking for the decorations too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What!? Oh no... He could be out there all alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Actually... I did see a boy in a red coat heading out toward the forest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh no! This is bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No way... He could be in real trouble! There are monsters and beasts in the forest. And that delivery person was just attacked...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>! I have to go after him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's too dangerous to go alone. I'll go with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Then I'll go too--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No, you should stay here and stand guard, Ishi. We can't abandon our duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I can look after both parent and child. Black and white bears are strong, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Besides, I was the one who started looking for the decorations. So I want to be the one to see it through to the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Rochelle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Then let me go, at least. I was there with you from the start. I want to see this through too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That boy must feel so lost and alone right now. Please bring him back safe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Sounds like we can leave it to the two of them, Ishuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...All right. We'll look after things here, and you two go find that boy. No distractions. Come right back once you've found him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We will. Ok, let's get going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>We've come pretty far into the forest, but there's still no sign of him...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...! Over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>! Oh no, he's surrounded by monsters! We've got to save him!</td>
</tr>
