<td>Ah-hahah. I've found a nice tea to bring back to Soleil as a souvenirâ™ª I wonder if she'll like it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh, this is the shop from the day Soleil and I first met. That day is now a precious memory to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ohh... I bought too many books today... I can't see ahead of me... Sorry! Passing through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>All of these look so delicious! I wonder what this fruit tastes like... Oh, I love that beautiful tableware as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ohhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yikes! I...I'm so sorry! Are you hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Not at all. I'm to blame. Oh, your books fell... Did you get hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Both myself and my books are okay! I'm the one who should be...oh? Are you an...elf?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(Oh! My hood came off and she can see my ears!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...Yes. I am. Well then, I'll be going now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(I put back my hood on right away, so I don't think anyone else saw. Anyway, I should get out of here.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh! Please, wait! Um... As a way of an apology, would you mind if we had lunch together at my expense?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? You and I...? Lunch together...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes! After all, this was all my fault for not looking ahead while walking... That is, of course, if it wouldn't be too much trouble for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...I wasn't looking ahead either, and I made you drop your books. It really should be at my expense...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What?! No, you mustn't say that! Oh dear, what should we do...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Heheh. Well then, let's buy each other lunch. That would make us even, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh! Yes, let's do that! What a great idea! My name is Soleil. I'm a therapist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And my name is Sophia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well then, Sophia, let's go! Umm... Should we go here? Or maybe this place? Or maybe that one over there? Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If we go here, they apparently serve delicious tea. Would that suit you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Heheh. We had a hard time deciding on where to eat that time too. Oh, so this is Soleil's house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Soleil? It's Sophia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Sophia! Welcome! Did you get lost? Were you approached by strange individuals?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No, I was fine. I brought a new tea today. I hope you like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Wow! Thank you! It smells so good! All right, let's drink some immediately! Let me prepare it real quick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>All right. I'll do some divination in the meantime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(...?! This foreshadows a dangerous figure approaching me. That doesn't sound very good. I wonder if my presence here will inconvenience Soleil...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Soleil! I just remembered something urgent I have to do. I'm going to step outside for a bit. I'll be back right away so don't worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh...? Oh, okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I wonder what's got her in such a hurry. Mmm... What should I do?! I wonder if it's a bad idea to follow her...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ohh... I can't help myself from being worried! As long as I'm careful, I'm sure she won't notice me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(I've come far enough. It should be okay here.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I know you're tailing me. How about you show yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hey, little elf missy. Mind if we take some of your time? Our boss wants to borrow your power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I refuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>An elf through and through, aren't ya? Proud and stubborn... If you don't want us to have to teach you a lesson, I suggest you come quietly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No matter how many times you ask me, my answer will be the same: I refuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Tsk. What a cheeky little elf you are. Fine. We'll just have to teach you a lesson or two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wha?! Who are you?! Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hey! Step away from Sophia! Hurting my friend is super unacceptable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wh-what the...?! Is she a friend of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Soleil! What're you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>All right then. Let's take her back to the boss as a souvenir as well! Get 'em, boys!</td>
</tr>
