<td>To think that you are all so desperate to retain me... I am honored.</td>

<tr>

<td>So we've decided, out of the goodness of our hearts as upstanding members of the Wratharis Guard, to follow your little thieves' code, just this once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iris</td>
<td>Our...code?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wratharis Soldier A</td>
<td>Isn't it something like this? "Finders, keepers"? Whatever is stolen is yours to keep and use as you see fit.</td>

<td>The sinister tones of their malice enveloped my vision like a veil of sludge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>All of the goods I had stolen were ripped from my hands and pockets, until I was left with nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Nothing, that is, except for my own strength. I was a beast both powerless and powerful; but that wasn't such a drastic change. Had I not been kin amongst the plundering, thieving Golden Wolves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Now I was being made to pay for our deeds.</td>
</tr>
