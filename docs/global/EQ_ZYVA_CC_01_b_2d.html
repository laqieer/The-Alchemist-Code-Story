<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I will be resigning for personal reasons. Thank you for everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Will you not reconsider?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I have already said my farewells.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Not to me, you haven't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's just...I no longer feel like this work is worth doing. Ahh, how unsightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Did you know that most people tend to resign because there is no worthwhile personage in the workplace?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>My duty is to stop you. You have been privy to too many of Greed Dike's secrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>To think that you are all so desperate to retain me... I am honored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Moved, in fact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'd prefer it if you would simply stay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>How...amusing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm not trying to be funny, I assure you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You are weeds, one and all, void of any worthwhile purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>As for me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I want to create a bouquet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>My old man ended up coming home. Or at least...part of him did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>When his severed head rolled through the door.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>C-C-Cap'n Golden?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What would have been the point of letting a lone sneak-thief go free?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Traitorous dog! He betrayed us all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>How could we report the annihilation of the Golden Wolves without their leader's severed head?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Aren't you glad to see him again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Save your breath! You're here to kill us all, aren't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's the law, I'm afraid. All thieves captured will be executed for their crimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Then what are you waiting for? Do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Still...can't help but feel a little sorry for you, girlie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Save your pity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We could have your head roll, but we wouldn't get much of a reward for turning over a dame like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So we've decided, out of the goodness of our hearts as upstanding members of the Wratharis Guard, to follow your little thieves' code, just this once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Our...code?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Isn't it something like this? "Finders, keepers"? Whatever is stolen is yours to keep and use as you see fit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>After we've had our fill of you, we'll sell you for a handsome profit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The sinister tones of their malice enveloped my vision like a veil of sludge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>All of the goods I had stolen were ripped from my hands and pockets, until I was left with nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Nothing, that is, except for my own strength. I was a beast both powerless and powerful; but that wasn't such a drastic change. Had I not been kin amongst the plundering, thieving Golden Wolves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Now I was being made to pay for our deeds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The false livelihood I had pilfered for myself, the Iris who was kin to her old man, the fragile life that was so easily plucked from my fingers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So far from anything glittering, its shade truly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Nothing about this is gorgeous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What exactly do you intend to do against them? Put away your weapons at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hrngh...nnghh... Wha...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>My apologies for ruining your fun, gentlemen, but I am afraid that I cannot allow this to happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Get out of our way! What right do you have to stop us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Me? I am Captain Yauras of the 1st Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yau...ras...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>We need to silence her! If the Holy Guard finds out about this, we'll be in for it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huzzaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>In the name of the Immortal Rose...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Scatter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ohh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The clouds parted, the rain lifted, the dawn broke. A whirl of vivid colors pierced my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Purplish clouds scudded across the skies, soaked in shades of tangerine by the light of the morning sun. The trees gleamed in shades of green, spilt blood glittered claret upon the ground, interspersed with flashes of indigo garb and fluttering strands of golden hair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Amongst it all, the Twin-Blade Knight stood out, as piercingly azure as a cloudless sky on a summer day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The spectrum of light that illuminated her, the Twin-Blade Knight, the Cerulean Rose, lit her up just like...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>A rainbow...</td>
</tr>
