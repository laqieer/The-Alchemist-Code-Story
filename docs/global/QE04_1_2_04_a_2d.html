<td>Why did you act so cold to her? She came here in search of the chief of the Voda faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I did it to avoid unnecessary conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Conflict...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Did you see her outfit? Whatever tribe that outfit belongs to...it's most definitely not the Voda faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Someone from another faction approached me wanting to know about the Voda faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Her outfit...? Actually, I think she's probably...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>In order to avoid senseless conflict, it's best not to get involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Pushing her away was what was best for my tribe. As chief, that's my judgment to make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You don't have to be so high-strung all the time, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Just the fact that you care about your tribe is enough, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You've come on this journey with me because you care about the future of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I truly think that alone makes you a worthy chief.</td>

<td>014</td>
<td>Wh-what are you talking about all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But...putting out the sparks between the tribes and eliminating all interaction with them are two different things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That kind of thinking increases the divide between the villages even further and causes the conflict to intensify.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>However, that is the way of the Toxotes tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We avoid conflict at all costs and will confront an enemy who comes at us with full force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That way of thinking isn't wrong, but...it's important to also make an effort to understand each other first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I really think we should remove the walls that separate our tribes and work together hand-in-hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hand-in-hand? With the other tribes? Such a thing isn't possible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It is. Look at us, walking side-by-side. We're living proof that it's possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>... ...</td>

<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Glurp...! Glurrpppp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The Jam?! When did they show up?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Glurrrp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>

<td>It worked! There's still more jellies! Run!</td>
