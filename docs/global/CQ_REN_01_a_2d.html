<td>Bubbles flutter in the wind--carried away until they disappear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This is nice, isn't it? This scenery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Sis, why'd you decide to join me today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I dunno. I guess sometimes it's good to make sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Make sure of what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Of where we belong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I had a dream--first time in a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>People do their best in life, don't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That doesn't sound like something an assassin would say, sis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Killing makes it that much clearer--the hopes and dreams people carry all come flashing through right before they die. And I take them all away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What's gotten into you? Is your stomach upset?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hmm, I'm pretty sure we ate the same thing, Renny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You're being serious right now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Dead serious. Why do we carry these swords?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>To kill, obviously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Right. To kill. I want to believe there's more to it than that…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You sure you didn't eat something weird?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I can't remember what my sister said after that. All I know is that, even now, my sword only exists to take lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So, this is where you've been!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Chloe? Yeah, I have a soft spot for this place. Did you need something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The Scarlet Flame Guard is conducting some drills, so I wanted you to join us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What about Captain Vettel and Vice-Captain Gerald?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>They're having an audience with the king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh? Even Gerald?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Uh-huh. He wasn't too happy, but he is the vice-captain after all, so…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hmmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We don't know when war will break out, but at least for now there's peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(Times of peace are favored by those who work in the shadows.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(I wonder if I'll have a chance to spar with Captain Vettel if war breaks out…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Can I kill or can't I? That's my only criterion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm not really interested in fighting those weaker than I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Something on your mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No offense, Chloe, but I can't tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Aw… Well, never mind that, I'd like for you to participate in today's drills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Is that an order?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Not exactly… It's just that it's a joint activity, so it'd be nice if you came along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hmm…Then, I think I'll pass!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>*Sigh* If Captain Vettel and Vice-Captain Gerald aren't around, you really won't join us, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>They make things interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hmph... That's all you ever say…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'll be back later to try to convince you. I hope you'll consider joining us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yeah. Yeah. Sure thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>*Sigh*… So that's what "doing your best" looks like--completely opposite from my sister. It's hard to even compare…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Someday, I'll die at the hands of an opponent stronger than me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's only fair--especially for a killer like me. All debts must be paid eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Then, I'll return to the place where I truly belong. In the meantime, I'll use lies to divert myself and float along like a bubble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Now then…there was a reason I came here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>…Do you need something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You must be new to this. Your reaction was too fast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>…What do you mean? I'm just a simple--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oof…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Assassins can't fool one of their own. I'm sure you suspected me, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But you overreacted. I almost don't want to kill you if it's going to be this easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But Vettel's mine. I can't have you killing him before me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Fluttering bubbles--floating aimlessly until they disappear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What on earth!? Oh, no! What happened to him!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Looks like you caught me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I heard a scream…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>An assassin was trying to sneak in, so I took care of him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You don't believe me, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I don't know why you did what you did, but I'm not the one to judge you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Does that mean you're going to turn me in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Is that what you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>No, I just don't want to be kicked out quite yet…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…Alright, leave all this to me--the burial rites and the report. Just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Please join the Scarlet Flame Guard drills!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I'm sure Vice-Captain Gerald will sneak away from his meeting and join us. You'd like that, right? I promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Seriously?</td>
</tr>
