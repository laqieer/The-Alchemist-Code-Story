<td>The time has finally come! It's the event of the century! The Survival Race is about to start!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I, Teona, will be your play-by-play announcer, while Richie here—who has nothing better to do—will be your commentator!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Was that necessary?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Now to explain the course! First, you will take ten laps around the arena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Then you will cut through the plains and enter the wasteland! Over to you, Lotiyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hello, everyone! Lotiyah here, who you'll find at the turnaround point! Once you get to me, please make a U-turn and head straight back to the arena!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If you try to cheat, well... My sweet little babies will chase you down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What are...?! Hey! Don't chew on the set! Stop it! B-back to you, Teona!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And that concludes the explanation of the course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Incidentally, the cameras and other equipment making this broadcast possible were acquired with the help of Phantoms from Slothstein and Lustburg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This is rather a bigger deal than I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Okay! Is everyone all set? Then it's time! Ready... Go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hahah! We're going to blow them away! Don't go falling off now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wow! Look at the Blonde Sloths go! They've taken the lead with breakneck speed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>W-wait! Let me get strapped in! I'm going to fall! I'm falling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ahahahahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Sh-she's fast! But you know what? So am I!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What's this?! Daisy is speeding ahead on what appears to be modified mech gear! What has she done to it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We modified it to make it capable of keeping up with a motorcycle. It can now convert the user's own energy into momentum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see. Thank you for that exquisite explanation. I award you five Teona Points!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That little savage really goes all in, doesn't she? If nothing else, it's impressive that it can support their combined weight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey, Richie! I can hear you, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>He has a point, though. It's incredible that this thing can support the two of us, especially at this speed... Reagan's Theory is phenomenal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hmm... I wonder if we can go any faster? Perhaps a little tweak here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Aaaaahhh! I'm gonna lose my balance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Don't panic. You must work with the speed. Imagine that you're attacking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>R-right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hold it right there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, would you look at that! Closing in from behind at a ferocious speed that is almost as frightening as the intensity of their love are Dorothea and Reida!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmph! There's nothing frightening about it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Look at that unbelievable dash! Incredible! Is this the hidden strength of a woman in love?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Never underestimate the power of love! My feelings for my brother are strong enough to shatter boulders and hot enough to melt permafrost! This race is nothing compared to that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'll do whatever it takes to obtain any power that will allow me to assist him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's right! Do I seek power? Of course I darn well do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'll become so powerful, and then he'll... Heheheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I've been curious about this since yesterday, but... Who exactly is this man you keep referring to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Who? I could speak of his brilliance forever, but I don't know his name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I see... Unrequited love, for someone whose name you don't even know. How marvelous! I'm sure he must be a lovely man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>He is! He is stronger than anyone, and his fighting figure is remarkable. He is the best man in the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The best man...in the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>C-could it be...?! Is that man my brother?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>There can be no mistake! The man you just described...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The best man in the entire world... He can be none other than my brother, Reido!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>As if I could love such a lanky man! Don't make me laugh! Just imagining it gives me chills!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>E-excuse you?! The price for saying such horrible things about my brother is death! Prepare yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You're the one who should die for insinuating that I would like a weed like that! I hope you're not expecting me to go easy on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Uh-oh. What's this? Are the two lovestruck women having some sort of internal conflict?! They're at each other's throats so intensely they've gone off course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>There, passing them by, is...the Magia Gunslinger Pair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Is that really our team name? Couldn't she come up with something cooler?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Look at those two... They're so heated up over—whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oh, no! Ravina, distracted by the fight, has tripped over a pebble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Careful! You would've gotten hurt if I hadn't caught you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>S-sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You all right? You've gotta stay focused, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I... I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Don't worry. I'll catch you again if I have to. Now, let's head straight for the goal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>R-right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Aww, how sweet! Fifty Teona Points to the Magia Gunslinger Pair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What exactly is your standard for giving out these points based on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Oh? Is it really so unclear what I feel deserves to be rewarded points? It's very simple. You see—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Nobody cares about that! Vivi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hey! The audience is not allowed to enter the race cou... She is definitely not listening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>M-Mei Fang?! What's wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What do you mean, what's wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I came all the way out here to cheer you on for this race and what is this I find?! That girl! Who is she?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>M-me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Yes, you! I do not appreciate those leering eyes of yours one bit, nor will I tolerate the way in which you are ogling my best friend! Are you conspiring against me, you thieving cat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Who are you?! You're so rude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We're taking this competition seriously. If you're going to get in our way, I won't hold back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hmph! I'd love to see you try and so much as touch me, peasant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What a turn of events! Ravina seems to be preparing to do battle with Mei Fang!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Let's see how Vivi reacts to this situation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Well, looks like Mei Fang might make a new friend, so I guess I'll...do nothing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>She will do nothing! She's just going to stand back and watch! Meanwhile, the gap between them and those in the lead is growing as we speak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>If this continues, the victory will go to either Caris' team, or to the little savage and her mate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Oh, no, Richie! Aren't you forgetting someone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Aaagh! Why am I doing this?! This is pointless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Captain Gormalas! We'll never catch up to the lead at this pace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>We, the warriors of the De Tribe and Go Tribe—once enemies, now comrades—shall take the day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Enough! I'm done playing this foolish game!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You know, I heard that the grand prize for winning this competition is some rather valuable treasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Why didn't you say that before?! Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Glad to have you on board! Now it is time for us to unleash our power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Huzzahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Wh-what the—?! Are those stars? Bonfires? No...! They're two bright souls, and they're charging this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hey, what was it that you said was important for Mech War Games? What do you need to do to win?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What? Uh, you need the speed and precision to hit your opponent in certain applicable areas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I see. Then use that precision and speed, Daisy, and you should be able to win against their muscles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Thanks! I've got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>And now...we fight!</td>
</tr>
