<td>That seems like the last of them. There were no casualties, so I'd say this was a job well done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Monsters of this level are nothing. Had they been like the ones from before, we would have been overwhelmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There has to be a more efficient way to deal with monsters. Vigilantes like us and guilds can't handle them all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Even if we can't become an established country, there has to be a way to help make this desert a more peaceful place to live. Something like what Hawk envisioned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Is it really possible to unify the whole desert, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What are you saying?! Are you disregarding everything Hawk stood for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Of course not! But everyone living in the desert has their own sense of right and wrong. How can we get everybody to face the same direction, and move toward the same goal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I can't bring myself to understand how Nefertiti thinks, or even Ryle for that matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I got Hawk's way of thinking, and I think that's why I just can't understand the minds of people who didn't come to help that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm the same way, but we can't just give up. If we do that, then nothing will ever change. We have to keep going for Hawk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's almost time. I assume preparations are in order?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>They are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>These sorts of negotiations are not our usual kind of work, but for the sake of our mission to protect the world's law and order, we must do what is necessary. You understand, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That is all for today. We will return at another time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Whew... Hawk, what would you have done if you were in my shoes at this moment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>My my, General Rashba. What a delightful surprise to see the General of Gluttony Foss here. How might I help you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ha! How shameless. We send you letter after letter; you send no response, and you have the impudence to act surprised to see me? I am here to get the answers you have denied us thus far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, well, I suppose I must give you my apologies. I certainly don't mean to be coy. If there is anything you would like to know, I will, of course, endeavor to give the answers you seek.</td>
