<td>Sumeragi?</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We...did the right thing, didn't we?</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>......</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What our father and mother did had many effects that profoundly impacted the land. But among those effects was the loss of someone's entire familyâ€”everyone dear to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>As the children of those responsible, we must accept the consequences for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>At least, that's what the people of Wadatsumi seemed to think. But that's not very fair either, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Grrah! It's all your fault! All because your parents were naive dreamers who thought humans and demons could just get along!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If only you were never born... If only you didn't exist, my family wouldn't have had to die! You don't deserve to live!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Really? We don't?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Even though we were born from so much love?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And you! You're our queen, yet you have the gall to shelter these demon spawn in our royal castle?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'll thank you not to refer to them in such a manner. Have these children done anyone any harm? I think not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yet you, driven by fear and blind rage, have taken it upon yourself to attack defenseless children in their own home. It's clear who is truly the "demon spawn" in this scenario.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You dare speak to your own subject that way? After everything I've been through?! I see now the rumors were true. Our queen is in league with the demons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You aim to slaughter the people of Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Stop harassing our queen! Come here at once, you cretin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Mikaboshi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Let me see your wound... Good, it isn't deep. You'll be okay. I'll call a medic and see to it you're properly patched up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I should be protecting you, not the other way around...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I just want to see you smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>How can I smile when you're hurt?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm sorry. Just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Please, don't blame that man. He's not a bad person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Father and Mother weren't bad people. Lady Mitsuha, you aren't either. And of course, neither are Sumeragi and I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Mikaboshi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Everyone's just scared. Everyone just wants to be happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Which is why we... We, and no one else, have to be the ones to bear this burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Mikaboshi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We promised ourselves that we would realize our parent's will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We promised to return Wadatsumi back to its true, former, glorious "normal."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>And we promised to make you happy, Lady Mitsuha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Mikaboshi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Of course we did the right thing! Come on, now. Don't be so glum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But...we left without saying a word...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well, yeah! You think Lady Mitsuha would have let us go if we'd asked her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I suppose not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Staying in the castle any longer would have just caused further problems for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Is your eye okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Completely fine. It actually healed super fast! Probably because of my demon blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hmph. If you're bragging about that, I guess you really are fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Is that...Father's knife?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yeah. And his recipe journal. I have something in mind for them. Something I need to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I've just been thinking, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>About what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The demon that's ahead of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huh? Are you trying to make fun of me or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>No, no. That's not what I'm saying. I just think...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Well, I think it's clear that someone's will is behind everything that's happened. Someone harboring a great deal of malice in their heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Wadatsumi, our parents, Lady Mitsuha, you and I... We've all been thrown into absolute bedlam by the demon called malice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That is the real enemy you and I must face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...</td>
