<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Lord...Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It has been a while since I felt the breeze of this continent... It's more refreshing than I remembered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Now, what is all this? You're attacking the Holy Guard? Hmph. Even the Holy Guard's "absolute justice" has been ruined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Z-Zahar?! He's...here?! I thought he was sealed in the darkness with Captain Cadanova?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The little girl...with Cadanova that day... You are the Lord Commander now? The end of the Holy Guard is indeed near.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>How dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>More importantly... Explain this situation to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Despite inferring from her Final Battle Armament that Spica is of the Shadow Messiah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...I see that your sword is poised to take aim at her, Zehn. Perhaps you can tell me why.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You are not just some Phantom... Zahar, how did you manage to return to this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>How...? Even hell itself could not hold such a soul as mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Heh... It is truly an honor to bear witness to the destruction of your hollow false justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>False justice...? You mean the Holy Order?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's exactly what I mean. The scripture of the Holy Guard is full of pretty, empty words, all for show.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Having imposed these false truths upon the world, it is no wonder that your "absolute justice" should fade into obscurity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That which should happen has now happened. It is only further proof that your justice is false.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What is this slander?! We have never done anything like "imposing false truths" on anyone! We just believe that people ought to live virtuous lives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No matter what you say, it is a fact that those who do not accept your logic are bound to be left behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Isn't our present situation evidence in itself that your "absolute justice" is false?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No! Our justice cannot be destroyed so easily!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ah, so you remain in denial of the situation. Well, I only came to help as requested.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>To help...? Who ever asked for your help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I was called back to this world because I it needed me... There was a strong desire for my return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Who could possibly desire to bring Zahar here...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That which most strongly fears that our world may be heading down the wrong path... The world itself called me here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What nonsense are you spouting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hahaha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Would you like to share what is so funny with the rest of us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Zahar, I never knew you could be so funny. "The world itself" called you here...? What a laugh! It was us who brought about this situation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This has nothing to do with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hmph. Disappointing. You really can't count on anyone these days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The world decided I was needed, and subsequently I was called back here. There cannot be any other explanation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It is unfortunate that you cannot seem to understand that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Then what of us Templars? Are we simply gnats unable to consider the needs of the world? Is it not only the Holy Guard, but also our organization itself that you refuse to respect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Our organization? Hmph. Have you affiliated yourself with yet another group? You are a man without honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yet another...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That man once was a comrade in arms of mine...as a part of the Shadow Messiah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You were not with me at that time. You would not have met him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This man was also part of the Shadow Messiah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I prefer to think of it as having temporarily lent my strength to their cause. At no point did I ever intend to act as a subordinate to this man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Interesting perspective. I myself seem to recall a certain someone joining me in the wake of personal devastation, having lost both home and reason for living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>For you to have forgotten that debt you owe me... I ought to teach you a lesson.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>And now you will turn your weapon against me? Hahaha... Can you really do such a thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Stop! I will not allow you to turn your sword on Lord Zahar...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Stand back. I do not require your assistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I am perfectly capable of taking care of such a dishonorable...friend...on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Well, this is quite an unexpected sight. I never thought I would see you extend such kindness to another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Kindness...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You didn't know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I could cut someone like you down in seconds. The differences in our strength are that stark. For him to try to prevent that scenario, he must be particularly fond of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Lord Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I must commend you for your imagination, but you have gravely misunderstood. What kind of leader would let someone else clean up a mess of his own making?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>After all, it is not as if you are some sort of challenge to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I see... In that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You shouldn't mind if I just...tie up a few loose ends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Spica! Behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>L-Lord Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Did I not tell you to stand back? Don't make me waste my time protecting you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hahahaha. What is this, Zahar? Are your words and actions not contradicting one another?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Are they? Or perhaps I think the value of this life is not worth losing to a malicious blade like yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>In addition, Spica has a duty to help carry out my ambitions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Spica... Make this the last time you wear your Final Battle Armament. It is up to you to revive the Shadow Messiah for those who have fallen through the cracks in the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>R-revive...the Shadow Messiah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Ha! Zahar, you are funny! You're out of touch with the times!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>The times...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Revive the Shadow Messiah? Don't make me laugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What is the point of reviving the dead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You are wasting my time speaking in circles. Get to your point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Listen to you... You're not understanding reality!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The organization you imbued with your own will and ambitions died along with you at your first "death."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I don't know why you think you can just set foot back on these lands, but I will get nothing from beating a dead horse like you with a stick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Silence! How dare you insult Lord Zahar like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Hmph. A fool can never be more than a fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Here are some words of adviceâ€”one fit to rule the world does not do so with force or purse, but with their eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Their...eyes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Yes. One with eyes that can perceive inevitable destruction and use will and reason to guide the world away from it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hmph. Perhaps this is too much for someone who can only handle killing things that are right in front of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>In the past, I at least felt that your violence had a purpose... To prevent others from experiencing the same pain you had known.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Well, perhaps that too is an overestimation of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>After all, you seem to have subordinated yourself to scum like the Greed Dike emperor. You're pathetically happy to be little more than one of his chess pieces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Do you understand...? Depending on what you do with my words, this might be the end of you...or the beginning, I suppose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Hmph. Such a man thinks himself worthy to be my opponent, when he barely even understands his own position in the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You sure have a lot to say for someone with one foot out of the grave. Allow me to guide you on your way back to hell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>He disappeared! Watch yourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Lord Zahar, be careful! You won't be able to follow his movements with your eyes alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Blood Sacrifice!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Ack...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>He deflected it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Did you think I wouldn't be able to handle your attack when I already know how you fight? You insult me with your artlessness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You are correct... My art...of "less."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Ack...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Lord Zahar!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You underestimated me, Zahar. While you were gone, I've had plenty of time to hone my sword skills under another master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Sol's strength is in a whole different dimension. I suspect that even you would not be able to match him in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>A different...dimension?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I myself have also unlocked a new dimension of battle. Farewell, Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Lord Zahar, watch out!</td>
</tr>
