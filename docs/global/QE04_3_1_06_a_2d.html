<td>Oh, I'm getting in your way, am I? Well, we never discussed a pincer attack. How do you justify that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What I seek is a fair battle between powerful warriors! Victory cannot be obtained through your schemes!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I will do what is best to achieve our ends...I thought that was obvious.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I gave you instructions to remain at Port Nahema. All of this...is to fulfill our purpose.</td>

<td>007</td>
<td>Agh...! What are you doing?!</td>

<td>No...of course I haven't! Once our deal is complete, I wish to fight you...Tehre!</td>

<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm not sure...but it appears he really has joined forces with the Gluttony army. What "deal" is he referring to...?</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Please wait, Tehre!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...If you have something to say, say it quickly. I have no time to waste here.</td>

<td>Allow me to introduce myself. I am Tina, the 45th chief of the Toxotes tribe. I am a Wind Shaman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>My time is limited. Cut the formalities, and get to the point.</td>
