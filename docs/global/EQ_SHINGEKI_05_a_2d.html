<td>Bud! I tripped the big guy! Get him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huuuuzzzzzzzaaaaaaahhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Haaa... That's one down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>All you need to know to take them down is their weakness! It's a good thing we asked Tehre about it, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What are you two doing here? I don't recall asking you to come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh? What're you getting angry for? We're here to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're not trying to say that we're useless or something are you, Lord Commander Basheeny?! Urk, it feels so weird to call you that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Little frog, you really are such a... Hmph. Fine. Do as you please—you always do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>All right! Thanks a bunch! I could get used to this kind of Lord Commander!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yeah! Thanks a bunch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Not you, too! In any case, I'm counting on you both.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We don't know enough about the Giant Taurus yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's why I was waiting to call you until after we finished investigating, but you just had to show up early, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ugh, come on! Tell him Victor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You got it! Listen up, Lord Commander Basheeny! You can't do everything by yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>And don't you dare try and say you're worried about us, or I'll give you a kick in the butt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's right! We worry about you too, you know! Get a clue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's what it means to be friends! Get it? Stop trying to do things by yourself all the time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Give us a little faith, you idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yeah, you stupid idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Would you stop that? Haa... I guess you're right. You've got a point, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's what I like about you! You can admit when you're wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There have been a lot of unsettling events recently, and we know next to nothing about the Giant Taurus. It's hard to see what the best course of action would be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So, yeah... I could use your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Told you so! It's only natural that you'd be worried. We don't even know the Giant Taurus' weakness yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Not only that, but the only ones who can really do anything about it are the Blue Flame Guard and the Scarlet Flame Guard. We're still recovering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I guess they're still reeling from the aftermath of the Lion Monarch's Charge, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>On top of that, now they've got the Giant Taurus tearing up every part of Babel to worry about—and right after that mess in Wadatsumi too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You're right about that. We can't let chaos keep running around the continent unchecked like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We need to put down the Giant Taurus threat. That's our job here. I'll do whatever's necessary to see that that happens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What are you talking about?! We swore to create a peaceful world, didn't we?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Are you going back on your word?! You idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What's got you worked up all of a sudden?! Haa... I'm not going back on my word or anything like that. It's up to us to ensure the future of this world, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That's right! When the three of us work together, there's nothing we can't do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Like I said, I'm counting on you two. Come on, let's get going. We're headed to the Earth Temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh?! Where is everybody?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hey! Hellooooo! Anybody here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Look at that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The Temple...! Ngh! Look at this damage! We were too late!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Does that mean everyone here was—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No. Tehre was with them. I'm sure they're all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I guess they must be hiding somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's possible. Either that, or they've scattered. Regardless, we have to find them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Minimizing casualties is our top priority. I'm sure that's what Kanon would say, if she were still Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Listen up, you two! I want you to send your men to guard the perimeter along with the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Have you found anything yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Only that it's worse than we thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Right. Keep searching. Stay out of sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oh! You're that guy from before! Nice to see you again! Um... Your name's Reiner, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>How do you know my name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What are you doing all the way out here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Are you...afraid of me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Levi told me that you're his enemy. He said you're a Titan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Me? A Titan? What is he playing at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh? What does that mean? Who are you, really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I don't know what you're asking. I do have a question for you though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>How can I get back to my world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Is that why you came here? To ask me that? That can't be the only reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hmph. You really hate me, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I don't hate you! I owe you my life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I just wanna know what happened in your world. That's all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Our world is dominated by Titans. We in the Scout Regiment are the only force to stand against them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That is why we must get back to our world as quickly as possible. Without us, it's defenseless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You...! You sound just like my dad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>If you've got something you want to protect, and are doing everything you can to make sure it stays safe, you're bound to say stuff like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>To be honest, I'm still not exactly sure how to send you back home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>But I will find a way, no matter what! I gotta pay you back somehow! It's a promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>The Titans come from your world, right? But the Giant Taurus from our world called them somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>So...maybe the Giant Taurus holds the key to you getting back to your world, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Dangit! We're surrounded! I guess we're just lucky that there are no Titans or Giant Taurus here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Don't get cocky! There are still a lot of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Nothing to worry about! I have this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>So that's what you've been fiddling with all the time we've been talking, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>All right! Ready to go! Presenting Mecha Weapon Version 2.0! I'm gonna use it! Okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Version 2.0?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I got the idea from that omni-directional mobility gear you guys use!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I didn't do anything to the power unit—I just powered up the whole thing! I'm pretty sure I increased output by two hundred percent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>The foundation of invention is trial and error! I jacked up the propulsion, so now not only do I have complete three hundred and sixty degree motion, but I can also fight in the sky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Admit it, I'm a genius!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Behold, the Anti-Giant Taurus Mecha Weapon! It can tackle the Giant Taurus, but it's also good for regular warfare, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Come at me! I'll knock you down with an electrifying swoosh!</td>
</tr>
