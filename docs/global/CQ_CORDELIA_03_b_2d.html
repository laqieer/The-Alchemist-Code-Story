<td>Alyu! Wh-why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I told you I'd come back, didn't I? I just got a bit delayed because I had some other business to take care of...I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ugh! I thought everything I said yesterday would keep them away, but they still had the nerve to trespass on your property?! How rude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're going to stand up for this vampire?! You must be in with those bloodsuckers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Get them! Both of them! Bring them down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What is going on here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Great timing! They're vampires! Use your magic to destroy them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Vampires? Don't be ridiculous! This lady here is the daughter of the Court Mage Sandra. She's no vampire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>B-but she stays inside all day and roams around at night!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We heard she's been seen with blood-red stains around her lips! She has to be a bloodsucker!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You think that's enough evidence to treat a person like a monster?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Very well. I shall listen to everything you have to say. As the official statements of trespassers caught red-handed, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>N-no, please...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Take them away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What is a Court Mage doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I am here at the request of this young lady's grandfather. He was worried about his granddaughter's friend being troubled by ruffians.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Then we realized that the location he spoke of was Sandra's mansion. There was no way we weren't going to come and help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Those idiots just wouldn't listen to a word I had to say, so I went to my grandpa for help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>My grandpa's a bit of an eccentric, but he's not a Court Mage for nothing...I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Indeed. He is rather capable, I must admit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Um... Th-thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You must be Cordelia. Sandra has told me so much about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>She's worried about you, you know, and sorry that she isn't home often enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Mother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You seem to be doing just fine, though. I'll let her know that you've made a wonderful friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>A friend...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Alyu. I can't thank you enough, but...why did you do so much for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Didn't they threaten to ruin your business if you kept coming here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You might be able to stock up on rare plants in my garden, but what's the point if nobody will do business with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I know my products are top-of-the-line. I pride myself on that. People with the right mindset will look past all this and continue to buy from me...I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm gonna be just fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(Alyu's so amazing!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(She won't let anybody bring her down, no matter what they might say about her. She sees things for what they really are.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(I wish I could be as strong as her. Able to hold my own and stand my ground regardless of what others have to say about me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm so sorry, Alyu. I shouldn't have doubted that you would come here again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I let those intruders' words get to me. I'm really, really sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Don't worry about it! I'm good at viewing things in the long-term...I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Anyway, Cordelia, that basket by your feet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, this is...well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I knew it! Those are the plants from yesterday! You gathered all these for me...I think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Y-yes. I couldn't find very many because it was dark last night, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wow! Thank you! You didn't have to go to all that trouble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But y'know, grandpa told me that brewing tea with this makes a powerful tonic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Really? I would think it'd be very bitter, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>If we try it with some sweets at the ready, it should be fine...I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hopefully this tea will make you feel a lot better! Then we can go look for more rare plants in your garden together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Heheheh. If you say so, then I believe it, Alyu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Then let's have tea together next time! I'll bring the sweets!</td>
</tr>
