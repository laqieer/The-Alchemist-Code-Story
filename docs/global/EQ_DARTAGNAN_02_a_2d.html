<td>001</td>
<td>It ends here!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hm? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No...I just realized you really are a knight. Thanks to you, the damage didn't spread too far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's fine and all, but...did you figure out the cause?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh, hold on a second...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey, you gotta be kidding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It didn't go rogue... There's an illegally modified control board on this Droid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Does that mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's Amis' voice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Something seems to have happened over there too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Amis! What happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>D'Artagnan, Megistos...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Documents have been removed from our office. They're all regarding confidential information about our airships.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What? In other words, what happened just now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>There's a high possibility that someone set it up so that they could steal the documents. Right now, we're gathering the non-employees within the facility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh? Am I under suspicion as well?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Of course not. That's the one thing I'm sure of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Megistos...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(Is he covering for me? Huh? Is he actually a good person?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There's no way you'd have the brain to pull something like this off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's why?! I regret ever having questioned my opinion of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh? What are you getting mad about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Who wouldn't get mad about being talked about like that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Of course. No one in the Technology Division thinks you were involved D'Artagnan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But from an external perspective, it's not that simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's why I need the two of you to investigate this matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You want us to prove our own innocence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Wait, hold on. Why am I a part of it too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Well, D'Artagnan isn't very knowledgeable about this facility, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But I'm busy with examining the damage and other information control, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>In that respect, you have time on your hand, and you're surprisingly resourceful, so I'd feel reassured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You just want to throw all of this onto me, don't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I also have to do things like confirm whether or not the blueprints have been stolen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'll take care of that, so don't worry about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I think it's a good opportunity for you to take a break from the guns and cannons you're always working with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>All right. Good luck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hold on a sec, look...argh. She's gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I guess I have no choice. Hey, Lady Knight, what are we going to investigate first?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hey?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh, what do you mean? Investigate what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Wait... You don't understand the situation at all, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hmm. I'm not really the type to put my brain to work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Sigh... Listen. Right now we're in a pretty bad situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The documents for our precious airship were stolen. You get that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ye-yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, normally we'd assume that an outside party used what happened as a distraction to infiltrate our office, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The situation is a little different. That's because we know the Droid was directly tampered with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huh? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We inspect our Droids once every week. If someone were to make even the tiniest of adjustments before that, we'd find out immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>We were betrayed by an insider. In other words, we can assume there's a spy in our ranks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>No way... I can't believe someone would betray a good leader like Amis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But, um, how do you we investigate that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That's the problem. The spy, of course, would have inside information regarding us. If we were to launch an all-out investigation, they would probably go into hiding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's not good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Right. So I have a plan that I personally find very amusing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I doubt anyone will pursue me this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That being said, even after that incident, the security was still a joke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Those in the Technology Division have become lax to their core. It was a smart choice to abandon ship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>How did it go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh?! A-ah, you. Of course, it went well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>As you can see, there's information regarding the airship as well as blueprints for the latest artillery system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>This will buy me a position in Gluttony's military ranks, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Ah, was that what the conditions were?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>He-hey, come on. I put my life on the line for this...huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Wh...why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Sorry, this information is all I need. I've no intention of recruiting a traitor like you into our ranks. Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>With these blueprints for Slothstein's military equipment, the day when we will reign glorious over Gluttony's military is nigh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>In other words, you're not only terrorists from our perspective, but Gluttony's as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Ah. What a terrible story. Thanks to that, it's clear to me that I don't need to go easy on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I was just thinking about test-driving this guy over here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>It's made with the technology you wanted. Why don't you experience firsthand just how much power it's packing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Huh. Long distance attack! It is aimed precisely towards us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Wh-what...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Of course, it doesn't end here! Go, D'Artaggy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I told you not to call me that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Bullets are limited! Aim directly for the head of the 'herd'!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah, I know what I'm doing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Arg-gghh! I will not die here...!</td>
</tr>
