<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>The slums? I have nothing to do with that place anymore. I'm here now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>But anyone can get out of that place if they just work hard enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I suppose I should have made that clearer to everyone before I left. They just need to put the effort in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>After all, if you don't draw the cards of fate yourself, you'll never get anywhere in life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hey! You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're that new recruit, right? Man, you really drew the short straw, being saddled with those two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Magnus and Wilhelm are talented Alchemists, but they never take anything seriously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Just so you know, Wilhelm's the worst of the two. Don't let him overwork you! And, hey, if you ever need advice, feel free to come to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, really? I'm not all that bothered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I mean, who cares who my mentor is? I just have to do what's expected of me—my job. It shouldn't matter what those around me get up to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I-I guess not, but... Geez. Couldn't you be a little more friendly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh. Were you hitting on me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Because if so, know that I am far too busy to see anyone right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>N-no! I didn't mean it like that. I just... We just thought you might be having a rough time, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A rough time? How could I be! Here, we're provided with clothes, food, shelter, everything we need to live comfortably. Not only that, but we're rewarded for our hard work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If you have a problem with those above you, you should work harder, until you're their superior—or at least be grateful that that kind of career opportunity is actually possible here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Tch. I guess this explains why you fought like that during the mock battle. You're just out for yourself, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Th-that's not—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Come on, let's go. We're just wasting our time here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What's their problem? Why would you waste time complaining, when all you have to do to get what you want is put in a little effort?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't they see how lucky they are to be here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I guess not. Well, whatever. I'm going to keep working hard by myself, just like I always have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hello, Ryui! How's it going? Have you been working hard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Vice-Captain Monzein! It's lovely to see you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Of course, since I had the honor of being made paladin, I've been doing everything I can to earn my keep! I always give myself body and soul to the tasks bestowed upon me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Excellent! That's the spirit. I'm glad you're so motivated!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If only everyone around here shared your enthusiasm for hard work. Truth be told, I was a little concerned when I heard who you'd been assigned as mentor. I thought he might have a bad influence on you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But it looks like I needn't have worried! I expect great things from you, Ryui! In fact, when we get a bit of downtime, why don't we pick each other's brains over a few drinks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm afraid I'll have to pass on that, sir. I can't drink yet. I'm underage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We'll have to invite your mentor and his buddy, too, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>He's not even listening to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh! That reminds me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What is it, sir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Magnus! I was just with the vice-captain, and, according to him, you haven't submitted your report yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Report? What report?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The one from the raid on those illegal Alchemy users!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, that report. Right. Thanks. I'll do it later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's exactly what you told me the last time I asked you about a report!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>How about, instead of playing cards all the time, you actually do your job?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's because of people like you who get complacent in their cushy lives that our hard-earned taxes get eaten up by the system and the poor remain destitute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The vice-captain also asked me to tell you that it's about time you submitted your latest research report and signed those documents that have been gathering dust on your desk for the last few months.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You know...you've been my mentor for a while now, Magnus, but in all this time, I've hardly seen either you or Wilhelm do any work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well spotted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hey, it's not like we never do work. We get around to it occasionally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Occasionally? That's not good enough! People don't cough up their hard-earned money to pay taxes for you to occasionally do your job!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Why do you keep bringing up tax, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Where do you think our huge salaries come from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The money you make in an hour of slacking off could be used to distribute bread to the people of the slums!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>How is that my problem? I only joined the Holy Guard to further my personal research into Alchemy without fear of persecution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That's why my policy is to only go on missions when I feel like it, and to pour every last coin I earn into my research and life's pleasures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>If you don't approve, talk to the captain and get yourself a new mentor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It's not about whether or not I approve! It's about the importance of hard work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But I am working hard—just not in the way you seem to feel so strongly about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>At your job, you mean! If you would just do your work properly, my quality of life would improve by leaps and bounds as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ahh, so at the end of the day, you're looking out for your own interests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What's wrong with that? No one else is going to look out for them for me! That's life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Is that why you've been doing odd jobs for Captain Othima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yes! I'll do any job that pays me fairly for the work I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>And that includes assisting you as your mentee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Here. This is your work plan for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I created a program to go along with it. You should be able to calculate precise estimates and analyze the total data with this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Dang! Is this for real? You sure know your stuff, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You made this after looking at all the work we haven't done yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Yes. It was hard work, but I did it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What a waste of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>And who do you think I put in all this effort for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>For yourself, right? To improve your own quality of life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Exactly. And what's wrong with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Now, I'm not going anywhere until the two of you have done your jobs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Tch... Fine. Whatever. I'll get it done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Man, I'm exhausted. I want to sleep for a week.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>All done? Nice work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I'm impressed you were able to get through it all, but please don't let it pile up this bad again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Hopefully this has taught you the value of working hard on a daily basis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Still...this makes me wonder why the two of you slack off so much. You're clearly talented.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Everyone says so—how it's such a shame that you don't apply yourselves more, because you're such skilled Alchemists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What right does anyone have to tell me what to do with my time? I'll do what I want with my life, thank you very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Besides, you're one to talk. You might've won that mock battle, but your Alchemy needs a lot of work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I-I know that! But I was told that I do meet the minimum requirements to serve as a paladin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I mean, sure, you clear the bar, but I think you might be more suited to engineering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I was thinkin' the same thing. You made that doohickey that's always buzzing around you, too, I'll bet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Oh, this? Yes, I made it when I became a paladin. It organizes all the different tasks I'm given.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It's really something, if I do say so myself! Of all my recent inventions, this is the one I'm most proud of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>It allows me to monitor the progression status of all my work, I can have it notify me when things are due, and it can even handle simple clerical tasks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I was actually thinking of adding a feature that monitors your procrastination, Magnus... Hee hee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>The more I hear, the more it sounds like that stuff's more your thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>What stuff?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Engineering. Tinkering. You always sound the most alive when talking about incantation gear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What I don't get is why you chose to become a paladin, when you could've easily made a living as an engineer or something. You're clearly passionate enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Well, isn't it obvious? Paladins have better future prospects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Besides, hobbies and work are two different things. Of course I'm going to choose the long-term job that pays better! That's just common sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Future prospects this, common sense that... Don't you have any dreams? Where's the fun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Fun doesn't keep you fed, now does it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Ryui? Are you in there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Mister Othima, come in! What can I do for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>It's Captain Othima, remember? Anyway, I just have a little favor to ask you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Again?! You'll have to pay me for last time first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Come on, please? I'll pay you everything I owe at once after this, I swear! This incantation gear just went kaput—I don't know what's wrong with it! But the buyer is waiting and I need it working ASAP, so could you please take a look?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I'm coming to you because I know you have a way with these things. You're my go-to now! Look, I'll even keep Magnus out of trouble while you're gone. Deal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>All right, fine. Hand it over. But you'll pay the exact amount I charge you for—no haggling allowed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Hey, Ryui? Thanks for the help. I never would've gotten it done that quickly without you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>You don't have to thank me. It's my job to help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>So? Spit it out. You're here to talk to me about her, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I can't slip anything past you, can I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I mean, it doesn't take a genius to figure it out. Why else would you send her away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Well, good. If we all know why we're here, I can cut to the chase.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I want both of you to be her mentors...and to do it properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>You must be pretty worried about her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Are you afraid of where her aspirations are going to take her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>That's part of it. She believes that she doesn't need to understand what it means to be a paladin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Or... No, that's not quite right. She just doesn't think about it. She's entirely focused on her own interests right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>She's straight as an arrow, though, and her heart's in the right place. Even we haven't been able to have a bad influence on her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Yes, she's dedicated, driven, honest, and true, but my concern is...what if she's headed in the wrong direction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>She's too steadfast, if there even is such a thing. She hasn't changed a bit since the day I met her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>See, I was in Real Heaven on a bit of business, when...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Hm? What's going on over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Hey! Give that back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Outta my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Oh, um... Yes. I'm fine. Who—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Didn't anyone ever teach you that violence doesn't solve anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>The hell is your problem?! This hasn't got anythin' to do with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>By the way...I've noticed that you and your friends have been sniffing around here a lot lately. Why is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Because, I have to say, I don't appreciate the intrusion. Word is, you've been giving my clients some trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>So, tell me straight... Does this have anything to do with the rumored Real Heaven Purification Plan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>From the look on your face, I suppose it's not just a rumor after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
