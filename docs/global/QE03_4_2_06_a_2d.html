<td>They're still plenty of court mages left!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>None of you get involved, understood? I'll stop those girls. You take care of the vermin down there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh...Captain Melvy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>These little brats have even cornered the queen! It's too dangerous on your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Dangerous? Having spent too much time working in the sky, I've forgotten what that word means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sigh... Once you make up your mind, you never listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What?! Is she planning on taking us on her own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I can't believe you've managed to come this high...even while pulling the other two with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You could've become an excellent air defense mage. It's unfortunate, Alma Haas Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh? You know about me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I've been observing your physical ability...your skill at Sabbath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You were a worthy individual to scout for our air defense mage, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Seriously?! That's like the road to becoming an elite! To be honest, though, I'm actually not that interested...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>With that job, you can only fly the skies of Lustburg, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I don't want to stay in one place for the rest of my life. I don't want to narrow my field of vision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So then, you wanted to work inside the royal palace?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's even more boring! I'm going to become...a reporter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>A reporter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The news that Envylia had fallen reached various countries in Babel, right? It even reached way out here in Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes...that was pretty surprising.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But that means that the people of Envylia went out of their way to spread it, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It made me admire those reporters who would venture into battlefields to make reports.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Bu-but it's such a dangerous job!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, in my case I don't think I'm the type of reporter who'd cover battlefields. I'm more interested in reporting on celebrity romances and stuff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I think I want to pursue that kind of gossip. It sounds more interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So that's why you knew about even the queen's romantic past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm thinking the first article I'll be writing will be regarding the scandalous romance between the Captain of the Holy Guard and you, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What?! Hey...Alma?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hehe... Sorry to interrupt you while you're sharing your amusing dream...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But, in order to prevent this country from being destroyed like Envylia, now it's time for all of you to die!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If you're sorry, then don't do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I have long protected the sky. My name is Melvy Urkel Lustburg and this is my job!</td>
