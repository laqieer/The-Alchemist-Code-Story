<td>001</td>
<td>Reporting! A small party of troops that appears to be some kind of rear guard has begun making its way toward us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Finally. How insolent of them to have made me wait like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Shouldn't we...do something? We stand a better chance of defeating them if we attack them now, before they are prepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Heheh. Well, I have a rather special plan for them, and it would be such a waste if we didn't make use of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>All troops, to me! Prepare to wipe the scum from this land!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>They've caught sight of us. I'm sure they are pleased to see how few of us there are. Bloodthirsty lot...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There is no reason for us to play their game. Everyone, split up and make use of your surroundings! We'll draw them onto our own turf and even the odds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's working!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes! The enemy really does have the advantage of numbers, though. The right flank—eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They're certainly determined. We're already on the defensive, but Ceclidis himself is out here on the front lines...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's just as General Leordas said. He likes to get his own hands dirty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ceclidis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My, my. General Leordas. How can I help you? Were you thinking of finally surrendering? Tsk tsk, unfortunately I can't do that for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Spare me your prattle, Ceclidis! Or are you not prepared to meet for a challenge on the battlefield from a fellow general?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh? What exactly do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>As a noble of Gluttony Foss, you must accept another noble's challenge—unless you would prefer to be released from your obligations?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hmph. Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>He accepted the challenge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I hear that it is considered quite a dishonor for a military man to reject a direct challenge on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If Ceclidis is hoping to be King...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. If he shows himself to be dishonorable here, then word would spread and his reputation would be tarnished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It would be best if we could defeat him here and change the course of this war, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>As long as he holds that stone in his hand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This power! Have you already abandoned your humanity, Ceclidis?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Abandoned? No! I have surpassed the limits of humanity! Meanwhile, you who have bowed down to the weak and failed to take advantage of the path you chose... Your life ends here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>As if I would go down that easily!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Leordas, you dare violate the code of the nobility?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Unfortunately, I have spent too much time on the battlefield with more unsavory characters. I've grown rather fond of their mercenary tactics!</td>
