<td>Finally. How insolent of them to have made me wait like this.</td>

<td>Shouldn't we...do something? We stand a better chance of defeating them if we attack them now, before they are prepared.</td>

<td>Heheh. Well, I have a rather special plan for them, and it would be such a waste if we didn't make use of it.</td>

<td>Abandoned? No! I have surpassed the limits of humanity! Meanwhile, you who have bowed down to the weak and failed to take advantage of the path you chose... Your life ends here!</td>
