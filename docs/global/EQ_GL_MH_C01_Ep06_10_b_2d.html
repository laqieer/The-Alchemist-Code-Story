</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>All four of us—you, Teach, Soren and I—away from the hustle and bustle of the city...</td>

<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Maybe go for some wine and cherry blossoms. Oh, Shion mentioned that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>SIEG!!!!</td>

<td>Besides the flashbacks you have told us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Have you remembered any more of your past self?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I'm afraid not. Just... bits and pieces, here and there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I can... Somewhat grasp what I had wanted to achieve before, but as for the whys and hows...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>But that's okay. I think everything that's happened in the last few days has given me more clues about my past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>With enough time, I'm sure I'll figure it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Will humans ever achieve peace and harmony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Humans are ever driven by emotions and desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Without emotion, there is no desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Without desire, there is no downfall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>But without emotion...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Humans are but empty husks...</td>
