<td>Lord Gabirond! We've managed to detain the Blue Flame Guard, but Zeke and his daughter have made their way to the throne room. We are currently in pursuit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You useless imbeciles! Dias, we must hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm well aware of that. More importantly, continue with your story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You told me that the Sacred Stone Satna, which was passed down the royal family of Wratharis, now dwells within Agatha's body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What exactly does that mean?</td>

<td>I am sure you know how, long ago, there was a brother and a sister here in the continent of Babel who attempted to become gods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Nimul and Emmel, the founders of Alchemy and the brother and sister who built the Tower of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Everyone living on this continent knows about them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Indeed. Well, the sister Emmel is said to reincarnate once every few hundred years and return to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Reincarnate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Such is the lore that is written in the Holy Order of Babel's historical texts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Coinciding with Emmel's reincarnation, it is said that the Tower of Babel would ascend up to the heavens...causing this world to be destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So? What of that old tale?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>According to this legend, those who harbor Sacred Stones within them are said to be vessels for the return of Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No...you can't mean...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Thus, they are referred to as Vessels of Reincarnation and are feared for their potential to bring about destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Your sister Agatha is one of these legendary Vessels of Reincarnation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No... That's not possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If you don't believe me, then you should ask Zeke yourself. Ah, here he is now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...!</td>
