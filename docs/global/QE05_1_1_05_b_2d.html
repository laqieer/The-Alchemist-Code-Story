<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I should have known fighting a professional gladiator in her own domain would be a futile attempt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So you say, but your sword work is very refined. I can tell you have honed your skills with much practice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You aren't taking this fight seriously, are you? It seems like it doesn't matter to you whether you win or lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I do not know what your aim is, nor do I care to ask, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I do have my pride as the apex combatant of this Arena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I will force you to fight with all that you have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I take it that the sword is not your preferred weapon. That much is obvious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What are you most skilled with? The spear? A bow? An axe or a scythe? Firearms, perhaps? What about the magical arts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There is no need to hold back. Come at me with everything you have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I will prove this Arena Champion can handle whatever you can throw!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(Her strikes are so precise! She's even throwing in feints!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm impressed by how well you can keep up with me! Then, why don't you try this on for size?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Uh-oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I've got you now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(I won't be able to parry in time! She might actually kill me!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What was—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No, what have I done?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You just—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I yield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Your power in that instant, was that—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I am uncertain what you are referring to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why did you let me win?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That was not my intention. Well, it was in the beginning, but you have genuinely defeated me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I was quite confident in my skill, but I now see that I am no match for an Arena Champion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I thank you for this wonderful opportunity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Is everything okay, sir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That fight, what do you make of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I could not make out all the details of it, but I believe he was using a power related to Alchemy, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You are not wrong. That is called "Spiritbonding", an art that has been lost over time. Only the Sephira retain its secrets now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Shall we detain him and inquire about his origins?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That is unnecessary. There is no need to make a scene. His people are not the type to bring disorder to the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>However, it is a rare sight to see a Sephira out of their village. I hope this is not a bad omen for things to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That was so close, Kamui! It looked like you could've won!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>No, it is impossible for me to win against her with a sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes. She is a natural-born warrior. It requires dedication and an incredible amount of training to become so accomplished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There aren't many fighters as skilled as she is. She may even be equal to Isidore, if not stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Isidore? Who's that? A friend of yours, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>How long do you intend to name me with such familiarity? We're far enough from the Arena now. There's no need to pretend to be brothers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh...but...I'm starting to get used to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hisham... If you get used to this, it'll hinder your drive to find your true family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You may think nothing of it at first. I'm sure you believe you won't change your mind and that your heart will be strong...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Until the day it leads you to forsake your quest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Forsake my...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You want to reclaim your memory and find your family, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That desire may be strong now. You may believe it will always be strong, but that is not the case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The more you allow yourself to compromise and settle, your priorities will gradually shift.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Soon, you will find that you no longer wish to venture out to find them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>There is still hope that you have a home and family to return to. So do not allow yourself to give up yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But doesn't that seem...lonely?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That is what it means to remain dedicated to something. Can you do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'll... try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Hm? I don't really understand this conversation. What are you two discussing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Wha—?! M-Miss Teona?! The Arena Champion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Oh, are you finished? Then I have something to discuss, myself. Ahem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Allow me to introduce myself properly now, as we didn't have a chance to speak before our match. It is only polite to do so before a rematch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What did you just say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>A rematch! Now that we know each other better!</td>
</tr>
