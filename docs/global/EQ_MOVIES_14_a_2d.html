<td>Liz! You're...flying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Heheh. Alchemia is back, so I can finally show you my Broom Ace in action! And don't worry about me—I feel fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm so glad you're all right, Liz!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I felt your compassion in my heart, Kasumi! You gave us all another chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm going to protect you and all the world! After all... You're my friend! I care about you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>L-Liz!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Aaaah! Hey! You've gotta be careful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I feel the same way, Liz! You're my friend, and I care about you! You're so important to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Kasumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Liz!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Whiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You may have your Alchemia, but nothing has changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This world will be restored once more to its truest form. I am going to put an end to the twisted way of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Nothing's changed for me, either. Tears will be shed at this world's funeral, there's no doubt about that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>And I've sworn not to let that happen! No more tears, ever again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I know that there was once light within you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Without even realizing it, we might have come to be far too dependent on you—no, on Alchemia itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But even that was so that we could protect the people we care about! To save their lives! I want you to know that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Tch! As if we have not been used by evil before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So long as this world goes unmade... The nature of humankind will never be righted! Nnrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Tell me... For what purpose did you fight when you were alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Aaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It was for the sake of this world, wasn't it? Or... No. Was it not for the sake of the people who live in this world?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You know, not everyone lives with noble thoughts like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Most people's heads are filled with mundane stuff, like... What am I gonna eat tomorrow? Or... I wish I could date that girl...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But a world full of stuff like that is still a thousand times better than a world with nothing in it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We don't want your desire to protect this world to have been in vain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We will see to it that your wish is carried on! So please...open your eyes, Setsuna! Wake from the nightmare that holds you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Aaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(It's that...pain again!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(Ohh... So that's it!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(Everyone is wishing desperately to live longer, to survive this... And I can feel their pleas resounding within me!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's the same for me... I want to be free to live out my life however I care to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Kasumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Goooooooooooooong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The Demons of Light...! You did it, Kasumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>To live on! To live freely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Impossible! This light...! She cannot be... An Alchemist?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No! I will not accept it!</td>
</tr>
