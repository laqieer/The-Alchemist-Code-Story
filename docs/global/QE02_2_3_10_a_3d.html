<td>Ethan?! Ethan, are you there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Fiona! Get down, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ethan, be careful! Get down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ack! It's too bad you're an android. That arm of yours is quite something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Right back at you. You continue to deflect my shots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Plus...your unparalleled ability to return fire is nothing short of brilliant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Without my armor, I would've been defeated long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Jeez. Don't sound so surprised. I've been a gunslinger much longer than you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I regret having to take you out, but it cannot be helped. It's my mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Reflex speed set to max. It will be impossible for you to deflect my shots now. I'll finish you off here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Tsk! Alkemono...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Aye, what is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If something happens to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Take Ethan and the little lady, and jump out of the window into the river. That'll give you all a chance of surviving this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Edgar...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's pathetic really...but it's all I can do to hold this Alkaroid at bay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>To be honest, if it increases its speed any further, I don't know what'll happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Th-that Alkaroid is that strong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yep. Unfortunately, I'm at the end of my rope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...That's why you should've accepted the power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh...? The power...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Aye! If you'd accepted the power at the Door of Truth, you could've easily defeated this Alkaroid, aye?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The Door of Truth...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Tsk. What are you saying at a time like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'd never place my future in the hands of an unknown power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Are you finished talking? Let's go, gunslinger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Edgar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You got to pave your own path using your own power, or there's no point in living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Come, android! I'll pave my own path with my own hands!!!</td>
