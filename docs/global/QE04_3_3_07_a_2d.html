<td>The opening has gotten pretty wide. Let's advance forward in a bit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Rega...please, explain yourself. What is going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's simple. I used the power of the wind to generate a mirage which goaded them into attacking each other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>A mirage...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah! I don't really understand the details, but...something about the wind changing the density of the air or something...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Anyway, right now, the Gluttony soldiers should be seeing each other as the Jam. On top of that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I used this incantation gear Jackal Over to amplify the Gluttony soldiers emotions of anger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Amplify...their anger?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I see. So you fuel their anger and aggression...while showing them a mirage that plants confusion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh! Is that how you survived last time as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yep! It becomes kind of problematic if I have to take everyone out, but, usually, it's simple enough to just confuse them and push your way forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There are a lot of ways you can use the power of the wind. Tehre taught me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Tehre said that Alia taught him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Alia?! I never knew there were so many ways to use the power of the wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes...we still have a lot to learn about how to use it correctly. Changing the density of the air...huh? Hyaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Good job. Just create an image of a large tornado in your mind. Now try and make that tornado bigger and bigger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Like...this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yeah! That's the spirit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Amazing! The smallest adjustment can make such a big difference! I can feel the wind stronger than ever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hmm. I'm still not used to it...but, with enough training, I'm certain I'll be able to master it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. We can become stronger! Thank you, Rega!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You don't have to thank me. I'm sure both of you will pick it up right away! All right, how about we go now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Agreed! Let's advance forward and make our way to Tehre!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>All right. That being said, we're going to be advancing our way through that vast number of soldiers. If we let out guard down, we'll be swallowed up amongst those soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Even if we get separated, our destination is the same. If we lose sight of each other, let's meet up at Port Nahema!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>All right. Both of you, let's go! This is the moment of truth! Let's advance forward...and make it through alive!</td>
</tr>
