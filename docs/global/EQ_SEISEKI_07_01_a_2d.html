<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Zain...you were a rare Lord Commander who lived under the name of absolute justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You were filled with compassion and loved by everyone...as if you were the sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The kindness you directed towards your comrades never faltered or changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes...even towards me. I felt something towards you that resembled admiration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sorry... I'm going to borrow Kagura for the greater good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>As if to laugh off the feelings I had towards you...you changed all at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No...perhaps you were hiding your true nature all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This coat of arms of the Holy Guard was left behind when Chihaya was assassinated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>For someone after the Mikaboshi, her existence was nothing more than an obstacle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You helped Chihaya...in order to make her lower her guard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If the Mikaboshi were to fall into someone's hands...there would be no greater threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That eye...can you turn it against your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The reason why he left you here must have been because he wanted to take advantage of Kagura's bloodline in order to obtain the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Since you were close to her, he must have wanted to stop you from getting in the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Is that the reason why you brought Kagura with you and had her stay by your side after Wadatsumi was destroyed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The matter of the Mikaboshi is top secret and must never be leaked to the outside world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I must also inquire where you heard that story from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You created a fa√ßade of justice and made those around you trust you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Kudan...did you come up with that yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Who was the one who fed you that idea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I did everything I did in order to obtain invincible power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm...sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>For me, Kagura is a symbol of Wadatsumi that was destroyed before my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>For me, protecting her...was the one way for me to make up for not being able to protect Wadatsumi in the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>And you're telling me that you're going to use her for your own ambitions...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>N-no...stop...Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Zain...the great knight who I long respected...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Kagura! Tsk...! Can you make it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I will not be misled by your false mask of justice any longer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Don't worry, Kudan! She's still breathing...she might be okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I...! I...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Kudan...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I will take you out...in order to protect this world!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ugff!!! Aghh...! Ku-Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Listen carefully... You danced to the tune of some distorted truth...and you killed me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>?! No...nooooooo!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...Are you okay? You were moaning in your sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huff...huff... No...it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Sleep a little longer. You suffered a terrible wound. Don't push yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Are they still pursuing us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Are you talking about the lot from Greed Dike? We've driven them back for today. They seem to have quite the interest in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Seeing that they can't take you by force, they're probably eyeing to see what you'll do. Heheh... I guess you're the center of attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Who are you...? Why do you help me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm just the same as they are. I'm also curious to know what you're after. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm gonna go and procure some food. Come now, don't get impatient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>With the wounds that you were dealt, you were on the brink of going to the other side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You should feel grateful just to have regained consciousness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>In order to truly change the world, such things as love, friendship, or half-hearted justice are not enough. What is necessary is absolute power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I can rid of you those unnecessary things and allow you to pursue true power...the power to surpass any in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Ughh...I think I'm at the end of my rope. My eyesight is beginning to grow hazy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I didn't hear it was gonna be this hot. Besides...what are these monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>They're absurdly strong...agh...I can't allow myself to get taken down here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Is this it? Am I gonna die at the hands of these monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Is my chivalrous knighthood going to end here?! You gotta be kidding me!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Huzzaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huff...huff...! You gotta be kidding me! No way am I gonna let myself die here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I am Victor. My knighthood begins from here!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Oh? You're surprisingly energetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I thought you were gonna croak like a frog and drop dead or something...but you're pretty persistent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Wh-who are you calling a frog?! Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Before you ask others to name themselves, isn't it polite to do so first, little frog?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I told you I'm not a frog!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Tsk. My name is Victor! I belong Envylia's Scarlet Flame Guard...I'm a knight of justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Huh...? What is a member of the Scarlet Flame Guard doing all croaked up here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Hey! I'm still a novice! Stop degrading me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Well, that wasn't really my intention...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>This volcano is under the jurisdiction of the Holy Guard. I'm asking you what someone from the Scarlet Flame Guard is doing here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You're...a Paladin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I'll answer you after you answer me. Isn't that how it works, little frog?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Tsk! I'm heading on my way to save Commander Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Commander Chloe...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'm gonna take care of you. Then, I'll be able to claim glorious victory for my first campaign!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You should've just said so from the start. Our goal is the same then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>My name is Basheeny. I'm also in pursuit of the Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You're also looking for Commander Kanon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Are you really a Paladin? Where's your coat of arms?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Wait...you're not an assassin who is after Commander Kanon, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hmph... I thought you were just a little frog, but you're surprisingly sharp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I guess you could say you're half right...? Well, anyway, it doesn't concern you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>...! What?! You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>An enemy of Commander Kanon is an enemy of Commander Chloe! Prepare yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Huh? How did you reach that conclusion? Weren't we gonna go look for them together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Shut up! Yeah, this is what I'm talking about! I'm gonna take out an assassin who's after the Lord Commander...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>This is a first step worthy of kicking off my knighthood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I'm gonna take care of you. Then, I'll be able to claim glorious victory for my first campaign!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Wow...you've got quite a lot of enthusiasm. I almost forgot how you were croaking over there a moment ago...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>...Anyway, I don't have time to waste here. Sorry, but I'm gonna have to put you to sleep for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Tsk! Huzzzaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I told you not to underestimate me, didn't I? You better prepare yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>...Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>...Fine. I guess I'll put in some effort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>...Wake up, Kudanstein...hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Heh...you're a sly one aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>The words he spoke to me...I can still hear them clinging to my ear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I must discover the true intention of his words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Having resurrected the Holy Sword Excalibur and succeeded in rescuing Kagura...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Kanon and her fellow Paladins now advance forward with the aim of restoring glory to the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>...Huzzzaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>...Sorry, but I don't have time to waste on you. I'm gonna end this quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>As these two young knights aim to find Kanon and the others, what could their purpose be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Meanwhile...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I'll ascertain this truth that you speak of! Speak to me...Emperor Orion of Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Having killed Lord Commander Zain, Kudanstein now finds himself a rebel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>What path will he now take?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>THE ALCHEMIST CODE</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Sacred Stone Memories -Laws of a Fluctuating World-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Huh? Kudan killed Lord Commander Zain...? Are you serious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>It's hard to believe...but that's the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>So you're now the Lord Commander?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>You gotta be kidding me...although there's nothing humorous about that. Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Seida, are you gonna go along with this joke? Come on! Say something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Hey, Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Kagura...you too are now in a position to wield the future of the Holy Guard. You must accept this calmly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Wh-what are you saying?! That's impossible! What's wrong with all of you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Unfortunately, it's all true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Zain was killed by the man called Kudanstein. That being said, the official announcement will be that he died in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>You're gonna play along with this too, Miuna? Come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Kudan...killed Commander Zain? How can such an absurd story be true?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I...I...will absolutely not believe it!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Kagura!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>It's understandable. For Kagura...Lord Commander Kudan was like an older brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Regardless of how painful it may be, she must accept it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>If you guys go to her, she'll get emotional again. I'll go check on her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Miuna...thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Don't worry, Kanon. Kagura is a proper knight now...I'm sure she'll accept it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>...Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>More importantly, what do you plan to do from now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>First of all, I want to contact Captain Yauras and Captain Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>...You said they were headed to Greed Dike, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>They're heading there under the assumption that they may be harboring Captain Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>It is possible that Kudan encountered the Lion Monarch Orion at the Wind Ruins. It's not an unlikely story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>I just hope they don't do anything rash. If anyone discovered that a Captain of the Holy Guard is making inquiries, they may accuse us of meddling in internal affairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Don't worry. Neither of them are careless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>In any case, our main priority is to transport the two that are injured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>...! Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Right now...I sensed an evil presence for a moment. It could be someone in possession of a dark power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Could it be...Captain Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>If it is Kudan...we can't afford to have Kagura run into him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I'll go bring Chloe and Spica. You guys go on ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>...Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Ughh...! Wh-what's with that power you just wielded?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>A novice little frog like you wouldn't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>All right, are you ready for this? Try not to croak too early.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>E-enough! Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Huh? I don't get you. How can you fight me when you know you don't stand a chance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>The battle isn't over yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Regardless of my inexperience or whatever bizarre power you wield, I will not lose!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I will be victorious in the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Are you saying you have a secret weapon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Who needs a secret weapon?! The difference between you and me is our commitment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Commitment...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>I was supposed to support my family...but they let me go, telling me to not give up on my dream of becoming a knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>In order to not waste the sacrifice my family made...I can't afford to die here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>I won't let a thug like you take me out!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>...So you're saying that your family's sacrifice is what supports you? Hahah! That's amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>You scum...what's so funny about that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>No, I really think it's amazing. It's an emotion that I can't grasp since I was born an orphan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>You...don't have a family?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Hahah. No need to give me that look. For me, it was just business as usual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>But...you seem to have made a big misunderstanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Misunderstanding...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>When it comes to who wins or loses, mental will has nothing to with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>It all comes down to power. The one with more power is the one who wins. That's all it comes down to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>It all comes down to...power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Yes. It's not just battle. That's the basis that this world is built on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>You don't get it, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>When people are fueled with a strong and passionate emotion, that's the first time they can stand on their own two feet as a person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>That emotion is what gives birth to power. How can you not know something so basic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>It gives birth to power...? Like an egg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>You don't understand it? I guess no one taught you. I feel bad for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>I don't really get it, but I'm starting to feel irritated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>When it comes to absolute power, mental strength has nothing to do with it. I'll teach you that now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Sounds good! Come on then; attack!</td>
</tr>
