<td>Mocca's...Fuu faction destroyed the wind tribes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yep. Everything is their fault!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No way...?! Is that true? Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's all true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>All this conflict within Saga was triggered by my Fuu faction. I cannot excuse a single thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's terrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But right now isn't the time to get caught up in such matters. The Jam are threatening to destroy all of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Saga itself is on the verge of being destroyed. We don't have time to be bickering amongst ourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I belong to no faction or tribe. My only wish is to protect Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Mocca...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You can dress it up however you want, but it doesn't change the fact that you belong to your faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Sorry, but there's no way I can believe the words of someone from the Fuu faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Fuu faction, huh? Neither those constraints nor Lilithâ€™s Hill matter to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hey, hey...you sure it's a good idea to be banging on like that? The Fuu faction is here as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't care!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No matter how you look at it, it is unforgivable to destroy another tribe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I can speak with confidence when I say...what that man committed...was a grave mistake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Mo-Mocca...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That man...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...! Sorry...I got a little heated up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If you truly want to help, then hurry up and leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>He-hey! We helped you just now. The least you could do is say thank...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's fine. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Seriously...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Gluttony Foss...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>They've been spotted numerous times around the areas where the Jam have appeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Apparently, they're chasing the Jam as well. I've seen it several times myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>This information comes from a dependable customer. I didn't pry for too many details, but there's no mistaking its validity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Try your best to stay out of danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Old man...! Thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Gluttony...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>So the Jam appears where the Gluttony Foss army appears...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What exactly does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Even in the village of Lezario, they showed up right after the Jam outbreak. He showed up as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Georgios, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Do you think he's been pursuing the Jam as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But...why would they do that? They don't seem to be pursuing them to destroy them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Maybe they want to research the Jam's curse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What should we do, Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It'll take too much time to get the merchants of the Tehre faction to talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>For now, let's try and talk with anyone from Fuu tribe that's in Paza village.</td>
