<td>It's coming into view. That tall tower, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I see. As might be expected from something that's been around since the founding of this country, it looks ancient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The clock isn't moving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes. I heard that it stopped at the moment of my father's death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm sorry to hear that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So, the clock stopped working when the head of the Elester family—a family that's continually supported this country—died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Alkaroids, aye! I can confirm the presence of Alkaroids inside the clock tower!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>After my father had died, Ethan was also removed from his position as protector of the clock tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ever since, the position has been abolished, and the clock tower has been placed under the jurisdiction of the Beckrams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Now that it's under their jurisdiction, does it mean that the Sacred Stone isn't here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But, until a year ago, Ethan worked at this clock tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's quite likely that some kind of clue remains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Right. So, what do we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Inside this tower is pretty much an Alkaroid den. There's no guarantee we can make it out safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I will go with you, of course. All of this is my problem to deal with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'll go too. It's not like I can go back to Real Heaven now! I'm definitely going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's some firm determination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well then, let's enter the now silent clock tower!</td>
</tr>
