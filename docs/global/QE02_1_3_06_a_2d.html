<td>I'm sorry to hear that.</td>

<td>So, the clock stopped working when the head of the Elester family—a family that's continually supported this country—died.</td>

<td>Right. So, what do we do?</td>

<tr>

<td>Inside this tower is pretty much an Alkaroid den. There's no guarantee we can make it out safely.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/edga.png" alt="Edgar" height="128"><br>Edgar</td>
<td>That's some firm determination.</td>
