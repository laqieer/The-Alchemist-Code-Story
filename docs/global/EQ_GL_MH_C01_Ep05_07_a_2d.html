<td>Whoa, are those... ALL Constructs?!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>An incredible number of Constructs in all shapes and sizes populate the room, each working on its assigned task.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The Constructs seem to run autononously and largely ignore the presence of Siegfried and the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The laboratory appears only partially restored, but the sheer number of functional Constructs indicates it is more or less operable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Simply incredible! This particular site must have been meticulously maintained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Minerva notices the Constructs from before extracting glowing glass containers onto tables.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...Hmm? What are they doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>*Whirr...* *Clink*</td>

<td>The Construct carefully tips the contents of the chipped vial into another vial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Those must be the Constructs from before. And that vial...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes. That was what attracted the monsters just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Given how sterile this environment is, leakage of the substances into the surrounding forests should not be possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Over there, Teach. I think that's our answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>*Sniff sniff* *gobble*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ugh, I was right. They ARE getting their Alchemia fix.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hmm. So it's just like in the Lustburg ruins...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>They're artificially enhancing these creatures with Alchemia-laced substances, but why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And did the creatures escape into the forest, or were they intentionally released?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So much to think about...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hey! Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Intruder alert, code yellow! All security, move to engage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Grrrooowwwll!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Alchemia-enhanced... security monsters? You have got to be kidding me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Quite a sticky situation we're in... We're trapped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Teach, can you and Soren watch our backs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Absolutely.</td>
