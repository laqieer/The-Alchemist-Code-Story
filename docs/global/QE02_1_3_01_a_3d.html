<td>Oh! It's delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Sorry, this meal was delayed for so long. Come on; you try it too. This cheese dog is pretty good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh no...oh no...oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh no! Now I've gone and done it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I won't be able to live in Real Heaven anymore! This is all your fault!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're the one who decided to help us, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Of course! I let my feelings get the better of me. It's all your fault!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ron, right? Um... Thank you so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If you weren't brave enough to come to our rescue, I don't know what would've happened to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?! I-I-I'm not worthy of such praise from you, Miss Elester!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I guess we should be calling you Miss as well, aye?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And Ronnie instead of Ron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, I-I'm sorry! So, your name is Ronnie?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Pl-please, stop! Ack! It's all because of your unnecessary comment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Come on, don't be like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You know, since you've got nice features...if you dressed the part, I think you'd make quite an impressive young lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Tsk. I don't have the luxury of living as a girl in that city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's not the same Real Heaven as the old days, where you could live off of selling the flowers you'd find blooming everywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That slum city was blooming with flowers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The Real Heaven district was famous for its streets being filled with the scent of flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It was even called 'Heaven on Earth.' The utopian scenery of the city was the origin of its name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Now, the name just sounds like bitter irony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Even if I looked for a job, any vacancy would be taken by an Alkaroid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>So, I've got no choice but to earn my living through theft. To hide my identity, the best thing to do is dress like a boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>All of that just to survive... I'm sorry, I spoke without understanding your circumstances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>N-no! You don't have to apologize, Miss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yeah. You might be the one to flip her circumstances around, little lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Have you forgotten what Ethan said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>He spoke about clearing the contaminated sky and making this a beautiful country filled with blooming flowers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>In other words, if you find the Sacred Stone Belphegor, you may be able to return this world to one where the flowers bloom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Also, I just remembered something important—a hint to finding the location of the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's this fellow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Alkemono, Ethan said that you would lead the little lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Go on. Can you tell us anything that might help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Squeek...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The little lady didn't know anything about the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But, Ethan entrusted the whereabouts of the Sacred Stone to her and you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>In order words...you hold a clue to the location of the Sacred Stone. Isn't that right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I don't know anything, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>He doesn't know anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Why are you telling me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Don't lie! Ethan's determination was real!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>He risked his life to entrust it to you so that you would lead the way! You must know something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Ed-Edgar! Allie doesn't know anything! Right, Allie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Fiona, you're looking for the Sacred Stone as well, aye? Will the Sacred Stone make you happy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yes. We can make everyone happy with the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What makes everyone happy makes me happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If it makes you happy, I'll try my best, aye! I'll think lots of things! ...Squeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>A-Allie?! What's this...a map?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Look at this! Hold on, could this flashing point be—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>No, it's not. That light is where we are right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You're right. That's our current location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Squeek! Ack. Wa-was any clue revealed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Well... You did the best you could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Why do you have to sound so condescending, aye?! I'm getting mad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Tsk. It's the Alkaroids. We've got to move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Ack... Should we head to the Elester family's mansion?</td>
</tr>
