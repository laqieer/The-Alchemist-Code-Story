<td>Ack! I can't see him anywhere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Looks like he's gotten away. He's quick on his feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But it was foolish of him to flee into the buildings!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We've practically cornered him. We'll chase him down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Do you really think it'll go that smoothly? He's not stupid. He may have even set some kind of trap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But he's looking for the Sacred Stone, right? What if it's in the ruins?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's not. I'm sure of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Also, as far as I can see, the only exit is back the way we came.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It'll most effective to wait here and ambush him when he returns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But what if there are other exits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Please...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I don't want to lose anyone else. Let's not do anything reckless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Bu-but...</td>

<td>Hey, Seida, there's something I want to ask you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>How can you be so certain that the Sacred Stone isn't in the ruins?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Not just that. You were sure that it wasn't in Gluttony either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This is just a guess...but do you know where the Sacred Stone is, Seida? Where it's truly located.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>At this point, it'll be more inefficient to hide the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Fine. I'll share with you everything that I know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...after we defeat this monster!</td>
