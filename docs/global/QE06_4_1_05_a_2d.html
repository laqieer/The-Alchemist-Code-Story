<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>And Kagutsuchi will be the key to victory. Now, what of restoring the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>According to Mikaboshi herself, it will require a great amount of mental strength, but all I'll need to do is offer up a prayer in the proper place at the proper time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Then we're ready. With this, the path of our counteroffensive begins to take shape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>In the end, we will not just have Kagutsuchi on our side, but Mikaboshi and Sumeragi as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>And with all Sacred Three of Wadatsumi in hand, we cannot lose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh! Do you have news of Sumeragi, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Jubei is presently following the ancient Black Star legends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Jubei...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Okay, so what do we know, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Recreating Sumeragi is a relatively straightforward matter. It must simply be reforged with the same materials that were used to create it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>In other words, with the horn of a demon that Mikaboshi and Sumeragi knew well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I see! And that's what Jubei is after, so it surely won't be long now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The problem is, it cannot be properly reforged without the flames of Kagutsuchi to temper it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Okay. So we need Kagutsuchi if we wanna return Sumeragi to its former glory. Got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But Jubei has helped us take a firm step toward our goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>And you, Amane, were the one who lit the fire in her. I am not a true successor to the Black Star, so there is...far too much I didn't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...! Another demon's horn exists?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes. Though I didn't realize it myself until Amane said something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't believe it! If something like that exists, shouldn't it have been passed down among the leaders of the Black Star Clan, seeing as Sumeragi is in their charge?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This information is known only by those with pure Rising Ashes and Black Star lineage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I don't know the precise details myself. I only put it together when I thought back to the message Lord Zeke left for Lady Celis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What message?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>"The Treasure Blade, the Spirit Stone, and the spare lie deep within Wadatsumi."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The true meaning became clear when Amane spoke of the origins of Sumeragi and Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Kaede's broken horn was forged into the blade of a sword by Sumeragi, the younger of the twins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Is there not some lore about Sumeragi that has been passed down amongst the Black Star clan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Until Amane said that, it hadn't even occurred to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It seems neither Lady Celis nor Lord Zeke ever came to understand its true meaning, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>While it is told that there is a way to repair Sumeragi should it be broken, there were never any concrete details about how.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>There was only a map with a single unlabeled marking on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So the truth only became known through the message, the map, and the knowledge of how Sumeragi came to be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Precisely. The message tells not of where to look, and the map tells not of what is to be found there. So without the tale of Sumeragi's creation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>One would have no idea to seek another horn there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Then why aren't we moving? We need Sumeragi for our counteroffensive, don't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Amane is yet to return. And we require the flame of the sacred art Kagutsuchi before we can reforge Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Think of how disastrous it would be were we to obtain the horn, only to lose it in a demon attack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>We move when the time is right. Sometimes, slow and steady truly does win the race.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We cannot afford to fail. We must repair Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>To cut down all demons that may oppose us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Then this Jubei person isâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Searching for the horn. She will return soon, and when she does, we will reforge the blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Just when I was starting to worry about how things were going, it seems the future is bright after all! Pretty great news, don't you think, Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There's been a lot of talk here about bearing burdens of responsibility and fighting for the future, and I feel like that's too big a job for just two people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Best make it an even three!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yes... We'll do this all together. We'll protect this land we love, as one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We are now well and truly upon the path to restoring the Sacred Three. With our collective wills combined, we will fight for those who cannot, and show the demons that our time is not yet through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...But, what about Celis? Why isn't she here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'm sorry it took me so long to tell you. I regret to inform you that Captain Celis of the Blade Fox...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Is no longer with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Jubei investigated the area where Celis and Judius fought. She was...found at the bottom of a nearby cliff, and passed away only moments later. There was nothing anyone could've done to save her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>No... She can't have died... I don't believe you! How dare you joke about something like that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I'm afraid it's the truth. According to Jubei's report, the wound on her abdomen is what did her in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>This dagger...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>A keepsake Jubei brought back with her. You should take it. I was simply holding onto it to ensure it wouldn't be lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>No... This can't be happening...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Amane! Get ahold of yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Keep your chin up, rookie. This is war! Save the mourning for after we've saved Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>H-hey! Captain Ugachi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>This is what it means to be Blade Fox.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>If you have time to grieve, you have time to fight. That's the greatest gift we can give our fallen allies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Don't misunderstand me. I'm not telling you to forget, and I'm not telling you not to grieve. Things are looking up for us now, but we wouldn't be here were it not for Captain Celis. We all need to bear this burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Just be sure you're not bearing too many burdens at once, lest your back break under the weight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. You'll be fine. For now, let's just relish our small victories while we can. The Sacred Three are within our grasp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We have Mikaboshi and Sumeragi. Hopefully Logi Crowley will arrive soon, and we can make the trio complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Though I suppose we have no way of knowing if he'll agree to assist us, House of Rising Ashes or no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>He knows nothing of Wadatsumi, I would presume. Will he believe us when we explain the situation to him? And will he accept the role we expect of him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Even if it may mean losing his life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>But... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The amount of effort you've put into tracking down and coaxing Logi Crowley to Wadatsumi is plain to see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>But the fact remains, he is yet to appear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It would be best for us to prepare as though things will not go to plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>But, that's such a bleak outlook!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You've got nothing to worry about. Everything will be fine once he gets here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You've been searching across the whole continent, fighting Greed Dike, and doing everything under the sun for the good of Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>So trust me. He'll be on board. Logi's a good guy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You'll strike a chord with him, for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Reporting! A ship from the mainland has been spotted in the ocean west of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>And it bears the ensign of Gluttony Foss, not of Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Edgar! Could it be...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>What'd I tell ya? Ye have little faith!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You sure did keep us waitin', though, Logi.</td>
