<td>Hyaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You're going down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Fyuuuuah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ack! More coming! There's no end to this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Not good! What're we gonna do?! If we don't get back to where we were before, we won't be able to rendezvous with the reinforcements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm well aware of that, Almira! All right. I guess I'll have to use my special attack... Miracle Kanon Slaaaaaaash!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There's an opening! Let's go, Almira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Phew... I finally found you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Seida!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Who's that? Is she the reinforcements?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yep! Amongst us apprentices, she was the most capable knight! You came, Seida! Whoo-hoo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Don't "whoo-hoo" me, Kanon. How long do you think we looked for you? Look how far you are from the rendezvous point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, sorry! There were more monsters than we expected, and we had to retreat at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's highly inefficient to make excuses at this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ack. I guess some things don't change. Did you come alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...I'm here as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Vice-Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's Captain Elect Monzein to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Come on, that's just a minor detail. It doesn't change the fact that you're my commander right now...wait, what?! Where did you get that injury from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I got caught up in your Miracle-something-something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Seriously?! I-I-I'm so sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>More importantly, regardless of how big of a horde attacked you, why did you retreat all the way here?! What happened to your honor as a knight?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Uckkk. I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Vice-Captain, enough with the inefficient, long-winded lecture. Kanon, who is that girl? I've never met her before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ah, right! I'm Almira! I hunt and live around here! Nice meeting you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We've hired her as our guide of the Saga region. She's a bit reckless but very trustworthy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You just hit one of your allies with your special move, Kanon. You're the last person to call someone reckless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ack... Well, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Seriously. After having been knighted into the Holy Guard, I thought you'd mature a little, but you haven't changed at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I-I messed up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>In any case...from here on, the 2nd Regiment will accompany you of the 4th Regiment. Where is the main army led by Captain Kudanstein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>He's on the campaign in the grasslands up ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We heard that the mission was to search for and immediately interrogate factions that are causing conflict within Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes. The grasslands are vast and quite a few of the equestrian tribes live spread apart, so they need more people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Then we must hurry and rendezvous with them. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hey, Kanon. It might just be my imagination, but weren't we supposed to rendezvous with the 4th Regiment a lot sooner?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No, Seida...it's not your imagination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm sorry! We've already gotten lost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Stop speaking nonsense! You even hired a guide! What are you playing at?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What do you expect! I know this terrain well, but I don't know where the knights are located.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Well...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...She's right. Fine, I guess I have no choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ah, there it is! Seida's special move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huh? What are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>They're this way. The 4th Regiment's distance is about 8 miles ahead. That's about a 2-hour ride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What?! How can you know that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>An archer is expected to know how to read the wind. Don't ask stupid things. I hate inefficient questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Can you really do that? Wow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hey, next time I go hunting, you should come with me! You can tell me where the prey is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What the...?! Stop grabbing onto me! You can read the wind too, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I can't do complicated things like that! Can I call you teacher?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Of course not! Hey, Vice-Captain, don't just stand there watching and help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I can't lend you Seida for something like that. She's the star of the 2nd Division whom I have high hopes for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Seriously? Just for a bit! If you're with me, Seida, I'll be able to stuff myself full every day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yeah, I totally understand where you're coming from. When I used to get lost, she'd help me a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>These people are getting on my nerves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Huh? Did you say something, Seida?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Nothing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Let's cross that hill right there north of us. There should be fewer monsters, so we'll be able to efficiently narrow the distance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>No. It's a good idea, but we're going this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What? Why? The path Seida proposed will help us rendezvous with the others faster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>We are honorable knights of the Holy Guard. We will not cowardly turn our backs to the monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Here you go again. You really should get that checked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Our mission is to rendezvous with the 4th Division as soon as possible. We should choose the most efficient route.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Efficient? A knight should always be marching forward with his head held high...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>So you're okay with depleting valuable food supplies and the stamina of those under you so that you can keep your head held high?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Are you saying that, as long as you maintain your Code of Chivalry and fight with your head held high, the results don't matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Agh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Are you going to pointlessly put the lives of your men in danger, just to satisfy your own ego?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Ughh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>U-um...I agree with what you said, Vice-Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>But...I think we should prioritize rendezvousing with the rest of the 4th Regiment. Besides, I'm worried about little Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>For starters, it's highly inefficient to argue over this right now. What do we do? Do we take the shorter path? Or the longer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Ack... It's to protect the 4th Regiment. It goes against my Code of Chivalry, but we'll take the shortest route.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Seriously. The conclusion was clear, so you should've said that from the beginning. We've wasted valuable time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Teacher, you're so cool! ...Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Look, we've wasted time and now monsters have shown up. Let's inefficiently take them out and advance forward.</td>
</tr>
