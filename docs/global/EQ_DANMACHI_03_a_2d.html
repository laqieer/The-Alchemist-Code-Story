<td>Seems like the beasts have calmed down, and the flow of Alchemia with them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Leaving us without any further leads, unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hmm. That's not good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If there are other people around who've come from Bell's world, we should probably focus some of our efforts on tracking them down, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Doesn't seem like there's anyone around to ask, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wait, I think I see someone over there. Is that...a child? And they look like they've collapsed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ila!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We've gotta go after her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Come on, wake up! Don't die on me here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Easy there, Ila! The kid's just unconscious. No need to worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Let's move them somewhere safer until they wake up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Good idea. Ila, can you carry them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Okay, this spot seems like a good choice. There aren't any beasts in sight, and it's fairly concealed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ila, do you know this kid?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But I have a feeling I know...just what kinds of things they've been through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Look. Scars all over, arms and legs thin as twigs... You have to go through hell to end up like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Believe me, I know. I once looked just like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>After losing my parents, I was left all alone to be exploited and abused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I understand where you're coming from. But you shouldn't run off on your own like that. You could wind up going through hell all over again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What was I supposed to do?! They could've been attacked at any moment, with all these monsters around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I hate to say it, but I think Kevin's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Acting on your own like that is rolling the dice. You never know what kind of trouble you might be getting yourself into.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But sometimes, that's just what you have to do! Otherwise you can't protect the things that really matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Sounds familiar. "That's why you should let me help you! I would never abandon you, or anyone elseâ€”I want to protect others the same as you!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...That's what my goddess is always saying whenever she gets mad at me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Not to mention the fact that if you got injured from recklessly rushing in, you wouldn't be able to protect anyone at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Or if you could, the people you were able to protect would always feel guilty that you got hurt because of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Wait, shh! That sound... There's a battle going on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ila, I think it's safe here, but just in case, I want you to stay and guard the kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Gah, I can't stand you telling me what to do! ...But yeah, all right. I'll keep watch here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Is that...Ais?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So Ais got summoned to this world too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Kevin, sorry, I've got to go on ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You got it. I'll clear the way to the girl for you.</td>
</tr>
