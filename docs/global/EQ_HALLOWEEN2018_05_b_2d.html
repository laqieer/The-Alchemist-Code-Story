<td>You guys understand, don't you?</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Nu numa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Okay, good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wow... Just like that, they all lined up and are paying attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Nu, nuumaaaa. Numa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh? Again with that? Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What are they saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>They really, really want to participate, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>They said, "We've been looking forward to it all year, numa!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Numa! Numaaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You're looking forward to it that much, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>In that case... Why don't we let them participate in secret?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Would that be okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, they participated last time, didn't they? So to cut them out this time would be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's true. Well, there are plenty of humans who are less well behaved than they are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Numa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I wonder if we can make really this Halloween sparkly like last year was, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Of course we can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Mei Fang!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>How long are you two going to fool around here? Didn't we say to hurry back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You're right. Sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Because you took so long, I got bored and made these.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This is...bean cake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This is no average bean cake! This is bean cake that I decorated personally!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What do you think? Quite sparkly, is it not? You don't see sparkly bean cake like this every day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's true. You don't ever see bean cake with marzipan figures or silver sprinkles on top like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Could it be...? Did you do this...for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It isn't as if it was for you alone that I did this. I thought everyone should be able to enjoy such sparkly bean cake, that is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Mei Fang...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Let us hurry back to town. The decorating is not yet done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Let's go, Hozuki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh, right. If you guys want to participate in Halloween then you better help with the preparations, hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Numa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If you work hard, maybe you can get some of Neica's candy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Numaaaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's almost done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Of course it is. I am helping, am I not? Now all that is left, Hozuki, is what to do with your flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I expect you to paint the whole town with flowers that will do justice to the treats that we have prepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That's a tall order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hey, what's that you're holding?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Is that Halloween candy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What's that? I've never seen anything like it! It's really sparkly and cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I wanna try it! Give me one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What? L-later, okay? I'll be handing it out to everyone later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Really? You promise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>If you don't, we'll trick you, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yes, I promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Well, well, well. Would you look at that? The treats I arranged are quite the success, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>They may have just been excited at the prospect of something new, but I'm glad they're embracing it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Children are the stars of Halloween, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(Now that I think about it, my father used to watch over me like this, with such a kind gaze.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(I remember this look... I'm sure, now, that she must be right. My father wouldn't have given me this name with any ill will.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You're right. Kids are, truly, the stars of Halloween.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I didn't want to lose to Neica. I wanted to be the real deal. So I got desperate, and because of that, I forgot something important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I forgot that the most important thing is the enjoyment of the children, and how they feel about their Halloween experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>That's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Hey...Hozuki? Maybe you're thinking about it all wrong. Having room on the inside, isn't necessarily a bad thing, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Well, if something is empty, there's more room to fill with all sorts of things. You could become anything you want to be, instead of just imitating it on the outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You could become something even better than what you call the "real deal".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I could...become something better... Something more...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Bean cake may not be a real Halloween treat...but that just means we have to make it better than the real deal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>If we decorate something as novel and exciting as bean cake it to suit the Halloween spirit, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Bean cake... Bon... Bonfire dances... I always used to enjoy those festivities with my father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Oh! At the festivals, they always have lanterns! We could have lanterns decorated with flowers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Then, there would be the animals in their costumes... This could be great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>There she goes, all fired up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hey! Did any monsters come running this way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>We haven't seen anything. What kinds of monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Uh, well... They don't have legs. They were apparently created by an experiment of Elizabeth's. They're, like, these weird...wriggly things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>We got rid of most of them, but about 10 of them escaped. Eh? What's wrong, Mei Fang? You're really pale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I-it's nothing! It's got nothing to do with them being legless, wriggly things!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Ugh. They had no plan to counteract those things. Man, this Halloween just keeps getting more and more complicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I just want to go home...so let's do what we can to get this over with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Good for you, Hozuki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>It's your first time being in charge of Halloween, right? You looked like you had a lot of tension in your shoulders, so I figured you had gotten worked up about something...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>But now you look much more relaxed, so I'm glad you're feeling better about whatever was bothering you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Spoken as if you had not been the one to get so worked up last time around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I... I did not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Heh heh. It's okay. I'm through with letting things get to me like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>(I've learned. I've learned that the whole point of making things sparkly is for the enjoyment of those who will see that sparkle. That's all that really matters.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>(I've also learned...that I don't have to do it all by myself.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>All right! We'll stage this Halloween with an array of flower lanterns!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Did you know that, in Wadatsumi, the hozuki flower is a talisman for good health?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>There may be a lot of meanings for it in the language of flowers that could be interpreted negatively, yet it also carries the spirit of natural beauty and tranquility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You're well informed, Mei Fang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Among the souvenirs from Wadatsumi I was given by Vivi, there were some hozuki flowers. I came to be curious, and so I looked them up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Oh...? You knew that all along, and yet you didn't say anything to Hozuki about it. How mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>It's accurate, though, isn't it? I mean, Hozuki sparkles most when she's just being herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Heh heh. As I always say; all anyone need do is trust in my command!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>If you do not have anything in your arms,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>you can embrace the beautiful flowers.</td>
</tr>
