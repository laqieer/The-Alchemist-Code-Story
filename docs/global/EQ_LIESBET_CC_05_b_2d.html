<td>Whooaaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This is...seriously amazing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So beautiful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Th-th-this is it, isn't it?! The Stub Rule flower garden! I think it is, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes...there's no doubt it's this flower. But...what's going on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>To think a flower garden would be here in such a snowy country...even the wind here is a little warm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There aren't many trees around here, so it's a little bit brighter, but...the warmth of this wind is strange. Is it magic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But there aren't any witches here, are there? I don't feel any magic...and the ice just now was strange too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Speaking of strange, isn't that amazing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Butterflies?! And so many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The insects that didn't become vermin must have gathered here. So that explains why it's warm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...I get it now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Alma?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I understand why the Stub Rule is called the flower of everlasting love in this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>By living near the flowers they gave as presents, these men might be trying to hold onto the love they felt while they were human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's the real expression of everlasting love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, right! I understand now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The love you gave wasn't self-sacrifice...you left your love in the form of your children and you stay here not to forget that love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I wonder if my father is here as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>He is...I'm sure of it! I won't forget the love I received from my father either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'll always remember! So, please, butterflies, give me just one of those flowers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It will be proof of our fathers' love, our mothers' who raised us until now...and the love of our friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I see. Well, that's quite some adventure, Liz. Thank you for the Stub Rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes! I'll always love you, mom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Blood is thicker than water. He said that same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Right, Dad as well... Oh, Mom! You need to open the shop...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hm? No...today I'll take the day off. I don't know...today, let's relax together as a family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Mom...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Thanks. Liz, thank you for coming to this world...and for being by my side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...Right back at you, Mom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(It was difficult, but I'm glad I worked hard!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(Dad was able to overcome that difficult journey all on his own without using magic.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(That's how much he loved my mom. He gave his life so that I could live. I'm sure he's watching over me somewhere now.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(I wish I could've met him...I'm sure he was a strong and gentle person.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(I hope that someday I'll have that same strength and power.)</td>
