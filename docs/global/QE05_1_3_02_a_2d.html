<td>Sorry to keep you two waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Not at all, sir. What is this about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Malta received a catastrophic prophecy from Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Malta, tell them what you saw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes, sir...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I saw...fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>A gluttonous fire erupted and devoured Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>How ominous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Could this be connected with the Sacred Stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I must hurry to King Narol to purify the Stone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No, you must continue your training, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Malta is not the only one who saw ominous signs. The wise women have foreseen a massive eruption of the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You mean... It's finally time for us warriors to...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes, I have orders for you, the commander of the warriors, as the Chief of the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Prepare for war. We are this country's front line of defense against the curse of Beelzebub! That is the duty we inherited from our forebearers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Understood! I shall gather the warriors at once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Kamui, you have a different task as the Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>As the Protector, sir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Waginau waits for you at Sephiron's altar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You shall complete your training as Protector there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Once you have completed this task, oversee the resurrection ceremony with Malta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The resurrection ceremony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Iakov, what is this ceremony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It is a secret ritual that enhances the purifying powers of Sephiron and seals the curse within the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It is the most exalted rite the druidic priestess can perform.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>A true Protector is needed for this ceremony to be conducted properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Take that to heart, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Understood, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Don't worry, Malta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We will protect this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I know you will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Warriors! Are you ready?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The wise women have foreseen a massive outbreak in this area!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We, the Sephira warriors, must abide by the ancient edicts to take up arms and protect this land!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Fear not! Sephiron watches over us! We will cleanse this land of the gluttony that defiles the earth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huzzzaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Send a runner to the nearby villages!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It may become necessary to shelter them in our village! Those who cannot fight, prepare to receive refugees!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Wh-what's going on?! What's happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hisham! Come this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>W-wait! Where's Kamui?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Grrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The beasts have gotten agitated because of all the excitement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
