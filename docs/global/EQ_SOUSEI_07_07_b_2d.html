</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Rrrraaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's...working! Nimul, if you do it now...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Right!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme...!"</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If I apply Alchemy and Spiritbonding...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes... At long last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Now we can finally begin it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The battle to give the world to humans, the Ceremony of Creation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Rrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes! It wor—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Are you all right, Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Asena!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Phew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This power is strong, but it's also very draining.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm not sure that I'll be able to use it for long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>However, with this power, I'll be able to do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'll can change this world full of sorrow and grief into a tomorrow where people can live with laughter.</td>

<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Have you obtained your dream? The power that can grant that dream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You mean ours, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Heh. Yes, you are correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I have been thinking about it ever since I saw the Infinite Serpent using that Cursed Beast's power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I thought that if an untainted core could be used like that, perhaps we could use the core as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Reckless as usual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You can hardly talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The power you have to slay Cursed Beasts is magnificent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, it's not quite like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Master?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I have never seen such a power before. With that power, it seems we do not need the flesh and blood of a dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Are you extracting more magil from the reaction to the purification of corruption?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No, that is not all. That power is something more... How fascinating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Heh. It seems my friend has found an object of even greater interest than dragons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Then—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What I seek is not the life of a dragon. All I long for is the ultimate gear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Therefore, there is no longer any reason for us to draw our swords.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Whether you are satisfied with that is another story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No, that's fine with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Then what of my sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>She had no intention of dragging this land into corruption from the outset.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Baring our fangs at someone harmless would only bring shame upon the people of Avaritia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What is it, Benika?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Something...is coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I feel it. Something bad has awoken. That's the sensation that I have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I've come to report, Lord Kubera!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast Mammon is attacking! It's advancing on the capital!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Then the time of destruction has finally arrived.</td>
