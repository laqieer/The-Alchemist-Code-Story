<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Are you okay, Reimei?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Perhaps we were the ones that led them here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Do you think there's a chance that this shop and this village might be attacked?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I doubt it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Since they have sweet bean desserts in this shop, I'll come here every day. If they come again, I'll chase them off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sweet beans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ah, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Do you like sweet beans? I didn't know that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I realize it doesn't suit me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's not true. Sweet beans taste delicious. Although, it is a little surprising. Hehe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So that's what you sound like when you laugh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I feel safe with my sweet bean knight here to protect me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>H-hey...stop teasing me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ultimately, though, Wadatsumi needs to be restored to a place where people can live peacefullyâ€”a place where I won't need you to always protect me, Reimei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I won't give up until all of Wadatsumi is safe to live in again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But, I can't do it on my own. I'm going to restore this country with the help of all those around me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes. That's why I'm going to need your help, Reimei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Mine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But...I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm sorry about what happened between us. I've been wanting to apologize for quite some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>My words caused you to suffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I said that I wanted to thank you for your help earlier, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It would be a double-standard to thank you only when you save me from the hands of bandits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ah, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You must have thought it strange that I only rebuked you when it was individuals from Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I got emotional, and I showered you with contradictory words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm truly sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No. Please, raise your head. I only did what I had to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's it. That day...all you did was what you had to do, Reimei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>But...I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Raise your head, Chihaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That day, I didn't have the right words to tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But now you've given me my answer. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Reimei, I'm the one who should be thanking you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The sweet bean sweets are ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, it looks good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Thank you, Reimei. Please, eat a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yeah, I'll do that. Gratefully.</td>
</tr>
