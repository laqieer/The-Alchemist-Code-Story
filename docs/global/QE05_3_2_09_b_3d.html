<td>Logi, now!</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Right! Leviathan, if you truly think that I am worthy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Then lend me your aid, for Agatha's sake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's really...responding to my call! All right, now we can...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Grrroooorrrrrgggghhhhh!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wh—?! N-no...!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Leviathan responded, so why...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's no good! You can't reach your inner willpower by relying on the power of the Sacred Stone alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sacred Stones are the ultimate source of power in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They can amplify the wishes of people who share strong bonds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Those wishes need to be strong. Your inner willpower needs to be strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You shouldn't be asking the Stone. You can make your own wish a reality! The Sacred Stone is only meant to help—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ngh! We can't keep this up much longer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My wish...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm not sure. I just know that I want to save everyone from the conflict in Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's why I've fought so hard, with both my strength and my words, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I haven't been able to protect anything. Not my country, not my father, not Dias, and not you, Agatha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Did I...do the right thing? I've lost everything—absolutely everything that was important to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, I know a thing or two about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I couldn't protect anything, either. People needed my help, but I couldn't save them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>However, so long as you are alive, you must live on! It is not over yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It doesn't matter how much you lose, you will always have something left!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Something...left?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I... I'm alive. I am standing here today because so many people have helped me survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's why I swore that the next time I met you I would protect you, no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So I must get stronger! I refuse to lose anything else! This time, I will protect everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes! I will protect everything by my own hand, just as I swore I would on that fateful day before the Door of Truth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I want power! Power to protect this world I love—power that will bring it happiness and joy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Agatha! Agatha! I'm finally, finally here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I will never let you go! I will protect you! No matter what happens, I'll—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Agatha? What's wrong? Open your eyes! Agatha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's all right. She's still breathing. She must have just lost consciousness. She'll come round soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I...see. Thank goodness. I... I'm so glad!</td>
