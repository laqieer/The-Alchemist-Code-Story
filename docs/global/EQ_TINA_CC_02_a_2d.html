<td>Gluuuurrrp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Was that the last one? Wow, I'm a long way from the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(The threat of the Jam still lingers in Saga. I can't just leave...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hm? This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, yeah... I used to come here with Father, all the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What's the matter, Tina? Is that all you've got?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Only with a pure, well-trained body can you control Ouija.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You will eventually become a Shaman and lead the Toxotes tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Do you think I can let someone who gives up this easily be the next Chief? Now, come at me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Father!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm fine. Just as I thought... You will grow to be a Shaman greater than me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Greater than...? I-I couldn't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No, that is how it should be. The younger generations have always been the ones sustaining the land of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Father...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Tina, do you love Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I do! Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The Toxotes, Father, and everyone else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Kiki, Adel, Leoferes... I love everything and everyone in this vast, natural land!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Then you must become stronger. Earn the strength to protect those whom you love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There will come a time when you must shoulder the fate of Saga. That is, if you can indeed manage to become stronger than me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm not so old as to let my child defeat me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Right! I will keep your words in my heart and train even harder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's the spirit! But, never forget, Tina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You, too, are part of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Those who cannot defend themselves cannot defend others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm...part of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Do not think too hard about it, as you tend to do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Though, some would say that's a good quality of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Thank you, Father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well, this is nostalgic. It's been a while since I've been here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm part of Saga, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Father, I love this land of Saga, even more so now than before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I just can't leave this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I have to let Mocca know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Now...where is she?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(Is he...threatened by me?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(No, the boundaries among the tribes are dissolving, but... I guess he just still isn't sure how to act about it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(Saga is changing. The Wind Matter has been restored, and the stiffened hearts of the people are starting to melt.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Is Mocca here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yeah... Mocca should be at the wind shrine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I see. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hey, uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Thank you. I heard that if it weren't for you, Saga would be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well... You know what I'm trying to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Thank you. As comrades living in Saga, let's continue to work together to protect our home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Y-yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Nnk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Concentrate! You must contain the Matter's power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>When you're manipulating the Matter's power within you, you must be aware that it may run wild, tearing you to shreds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yes, Voda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Haa...! Haa...! I'm...sorry. I just can't seem to get it right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It's fine. Reabsorbing the Matter you discharged back into your body takes time to master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>We don't have the luxury of time. This one must become the Wind Sprite Alia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>There's no rush. Tamis is doing just fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That's exactly the kind of talk that comes under the title of "luxury." It is imperative that we get the Sprite Quartet assembled to rebuild Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It doesn't help to be hasty. What we should do for the time being is watch over Saga with care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Now, don't get started, you two. Tehre has a point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>We can't keep meeting here while the reconstruction is still underway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>We do need her to be able to carry the Matter within her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Do you think I will be able to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Don't worry, I have faith in you. I know you can do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>That's right! Be confident, Miss Tamis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Mocca... Lisbeth... I'll do my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Well, we will come again to train you. It is about time we return to our temples to store our various Matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We seem to have a visitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Excuse me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Miss Tina! What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Hey, Liz. I had something to talk about with Mocca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>With me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Tina, Mocca... Can that talk wait for just a moment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What's the matter, Tamis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I...sense an ominous wind from outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The Jam?! We can talk later! Let's go, Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'm coming, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Huh, how reliable. It seems our help isn't needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What is the matter, Tehre?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It is just... Something has caught my attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Something bothering you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Mm...</td>
</tr>
