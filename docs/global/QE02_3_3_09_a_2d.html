<td>Whew. Quite the home base they've got here. This place is crawling with one vile thing after another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>With a production line that size, it makes sense. Hmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Discovered. Intruders discovered. Elimination will now begin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Bazookas don't work...?! Not good. They're coming this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hey, what's the matter? You've got an uncharacteristically timid expression on your face. Are you trying to make me laugh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Idiot...I was thinking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don! They're coming, Don!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Shut up. I'm taking a break. Hey...what's got you thinking now? Is there something that bothers you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I told you how there was a pedestal like the one we just saw at the clock tower, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yeah...what about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>These pedestals are located in two places...underground and at the top of the clock tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There was a similar facility underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Most likely, the Demons now loose in our world were resurrected there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>And...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What I'm curious about is the pedestal at the top of the clock tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Since there was no power source up there, I jumped to the conclusion that that's what the Sacred Stone was being used for, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There's no way they'd use a legendary Sacred Stone just to run a clock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Agreed. There's still some secret hidden within that clock tower; my instinct tells me so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Don!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Tsk. Shut up. This should have an effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I found this bullet in the underground facility. It must be pretty effective if it's a weapon they're developing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wh-whoa...! You just blew away the lot of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No...there's still more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Make a move, intruders. I'll shoot you down from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's hitman-type Alkaroid. I was nearly taken out by it. Don't let your guard down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm no schmuck like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Tsk. You idiot!</td>
