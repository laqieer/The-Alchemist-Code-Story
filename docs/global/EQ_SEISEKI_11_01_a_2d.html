<td>002</td>
<td>Save this world from Greed Dike!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Dieeee!!!</td>

<td>Aghhhhhhhhh!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ack...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I come back to this world for the first time in a while and this is the mess that awaits me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>?! Wa...wahh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Who are you? Did you come to help her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I am a wandering soul. I was merely drawn here by a violent clash of power. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No...way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If you intend to harm this girl, consider your life forfeit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>K-Kudan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Kudan...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You... You're alive! How can this be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A certain someone sent me back from the world of darkness. Hehe...more like kicked me out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>A certain...someone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ah... I know you. If I am not mistaken, you are the former Captain Kudanstein of the Holy Guard. The one who fell into the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Silence. How dare you interrupt my conversation with Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ha! You're interesting! When was the last time someone spoke to me in such a disrespectful way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I don't see your point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>My point is...you're a fool for underestimating me. I will make you regret speaking to me like that. Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Kudan!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Worry more about yourself, redhead. I still plan to kill you, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Urg...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ugh...! What was that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You survived?! You're tougher than you look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Kudan! Run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...Bang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Nngh! Oof... You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>All you had to do was mind your own business...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Kagura, this isn't your battle anymore. Run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This isn't about protecting you. That's not... That's not my right any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>However, there's a piece of trash here just begging to be taken out. Who am I to deny its wishes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Kudan...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hmph. This is just not my lucky day... I'll never hear the end of it if my people learn I've been made a fool of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Go, Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Kagutsuchi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You think I'll just let you escape now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You don't seem to understand your situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's not Kagura who needs to worry about escaping right now. It's you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You... You'll pay for your disrespect with your life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm afraid you've got it backwards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Meanwhile...in Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Suzuka! Tell me about our defensive guard! And how is the evacuation of the residents going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The evacuation has been completed! Basheeny and Kazahaya are at the front lines. Everything is prepared as you instructed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Good. Those Templars are capable of appearing out of nowhere. Be on your guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Understood! I swear, if those Templars so much as point a finger at you, Mistress...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>So there is a samurai in the Holy Guard... This is the first I am hearing of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Suzuka!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Very impressive... You stopped my sword. As expected of a Lord Commander, you are no slouch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Ack! Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I am Zehn, of the Templars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The Veda Templars?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>When did you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>As a Templar, I am here to take your life in the name of the dream my comrades and I share.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What the...?! Are you...dancing...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...?! Everyone, watch out! That's an attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Ahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Everyone...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It's done. Say your goodbyes to this world now, while you still can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>It's done. Say your goodbyes to this world now, while you still can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Ack...! All the Paladins with me, taken down in an instant... How is this possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Mistress, listen! He uses a swordfighting style known as "Iai" in which he draws and sheaths his sword every time he attacks... You must take advantage of that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Iai? Taking down an enemy as you draw your sword...? That's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Even swordmasters find it impossible to track the movements of a sword using this style!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I believe that this man has refined his skill to maximize the speed he can achieve while still maintaining control of the tip of the blade, allowing him to do a lot of damage from a relatively safe distance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You were able to discern that much about my Iai fighting style with a single glance? How unexpected. Your skill with the sword must be above average.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I can only see some of it... I've faced numerous opponents who have made use of the Iai style, and the degree of ability is completely different from anything I've ever seen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>If this isn't timed just right, we're done for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Suzuka!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Attempting to block my movement in order to allow your mistress to escape... How quaint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Allow my Mistress to escape...? I am not foolish enough to overestimate my own swordfighting skill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I know that I am no match for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Steel Cutting Flash!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Nngh... Mistress, I will be your shield so that you can take this man down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?! No! Suzuka, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I see. You plan to use your own body to slow me down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>My Mistress is the light in the darkness... She is necessary to help calm this chaotic world. I won't let someone like you lay your hands on her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Huzzzaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>He disappeared...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>To understand the limits of your own strength, and yet be willing to sacrifice your own life... I am not unmoved. I must revise my opinion of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Suzuka, behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>However, not unlike you, I too have someone who depends on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I hope you will not think less of me for my unwavering belief that the path he lays forth is the one true path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>U-ughh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Suzuka!!! Run!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You?! What are you doing? Why have you crashed this battle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>That...is my question. Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I cannot allow you to slay this person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>This woman is a friend of Kanon, a person to whom I owe a great debt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Spica?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>I am pleased to see that you are well. Chloe directed me here. I have come to lend what help I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>You brought backup? No matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I need only to destroy you, and another loose end will have been resolved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>From behind?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Hmph. Deflected again. You all are giving a new meaning to the power of friendship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Kanon. I came to help you, but now you're helping me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>No, I really appreciate that you're here, Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>The biggest issue is that man's strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Yeah! His skill is on a whole other level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Hmph... This is not what I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
