<td>Hello there, ma'am! How are you today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh! Hello, Blitz! I'm fine, my dear. Thank you again for yesterday! You were a huge help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You just let me know if you need anything else, all right? I've no plans to go anywhere for a while yet. I'm here to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ohohoh! You're a fine young man. Here, take this apple. It's the biggest one I picked this morning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Really?! For me? Thanks, ma'am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh? Is something going on over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>S-stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That doesn't sound good! Sorry, ma'am, but I think I'd better go check it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What's going on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What's it to you? We're in the middle of somethin' here. Keep your plastered nose out of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm soaked to the bone thanks to this little brat! Aaaachoo! Ugh... See? Now I've caught a bloody cold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It wasn't my f-fault! Y-you're the one who jumped out of nowhere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oi! You shut yer mouth! Just take me to yer parents!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Leave her alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What is the meaning of this commotion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yikes! Y-you're...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You must be terribly brave to cause trouble in my jurisdiction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>E-easy there, sir! We haven't done anything wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Those who disrupt order in my city will be punished, without exception. Guards! Take them away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And what of you two? Are you unharmed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm fine, sir, but... You were making a pretty scary face, so that girl ran off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I suppose she must have heard the rumors about me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Rumors? Come to think of it, those scoundrels did seem to know you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yet you clearly do not. Well, not that it matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's a rough way to put it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I am Inquisitor Gilfred. My name will surely suffice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I doubt anyone will want much to do with you if you go around asking questions about me; but I am sure that someone will be willing to share a rumor or two of mine for your benefit, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's it?! Not a "Nice to meet you!" or a "How do you do?"? Oh! Where are my manners? The name's Blitz! I'm a traveler. Just got into the city yesterday! I hope we'll see each other around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I do not appreciate having an outsider strut into my city and begin meddling in the affairs of this nation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Well, I know I said I'm a traveler, but I'm really just here to help people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Aw, c'mon! Don't make that face! Don't you know how scary you look?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I should think it only natural that I should appear grave, having learned that an unaffiliated layabout is going around stirring up trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I don't think I'm causing anyone any trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Although... If it's that important to you that I'm part of something, you should know that the Envylian Guard has offered me a place among their ranks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm still thinking it over, of course. For now, I'm still a lone wolf...but a helpful one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You? You were offered a place in the Envylian Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>There you are, Gilfreddy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Those were our buddies ya 'ad taken away... You're gonna pay that debt in your own blood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>They were merely given the appropriate punishment for daring to disrupt order in my city. I do not believe that you have any grounds to question my actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That's right! Your friends were the ones in the wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So bloody what?! Get out of our way, or we'll knock ya down right next to 'im!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Very well. You had your chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Blitz, was it? You will want to stand back. Men of their ilk can only be quelled by force alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Pfft! As if! No way am I just gonna stand back and watch you take care of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Whatever. Do as you will.</td>
</tr>
