<td>002</td>
<td>Zero... So you ended up going with seven members?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I think about whether I'm worthy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's my duty to look like I know what I'm doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Make it seem like I foresee events and indomitably stand my ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Still, my eyes are always following others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Following Vanir when he was around, and the Dead Nine when the King of Lost Blue appeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I unconsciously followed after those with power. Even now...</td>

<td>What would he do? If I were him, how would I live?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Footsteps approaching from behind... The pioneer's cross and those who are gone chase after me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I gathered ten. Yet already some are gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Zwei is no more. I'm to blame for her demise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Drei is no more. Though I have the power to shine as the sun alone, I betrayed him by surrounding myself with comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I even suspect bringing in Füry was my attempt at atonement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>And Zechs...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>A person's will is inherited, their dying wishes becoming the burden of another. I've seen it happen over and over again. I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>To overturn the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I have lost so much chasing this dream, and caused others to lose so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>How could I? I've not had to endure the sort of past that they went through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>All I've ever done with my life was fight my own poverty. How could I justify them losing so much for my sake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I grew my knowledge, but I was still so empty. I used big talk to drag them along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I can't help but worry whether if I was ever worthy of doing so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...?! What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>How goes the progress?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Aaaaaagh! A monster...from below!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Both of you are so odd, Nero and Vanir. How can you stand to wait?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Run! Hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Run where?! This place is all that we have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I've waited long enough! I cannot deny that I am excruciatingly bored!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I provide a trial for those of you who might be worthy! Whether you like it or not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What is with that surprised look on your face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Eek?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It is a simple thing to make quick pawns out of wild Phantom Soldiers wandering around Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What... Huh? N-no, I was just w-wondering how or why you're...uh...f-floating?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>What a foolish question! To show off, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Pitiful humans... Gaze upon my visage and despair! For it is I who shall determine your destiny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Such an impatient dragon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>As soon as the Templars were gathered...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I say we go back to bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No. We will see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Now I alone stand before you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Try and stop me, Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Vanir, do you come?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Or do you wait?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Grraaaaaaaarrrghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Grrgh! Aaaaarrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It is not yet time for the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Zehn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The stage is not yet even set. How ill-mannered of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I never expected to be lectured on manners by one of Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I hail from another land. My family is elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Then I do not mind if you were to run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>However, this is the path that will lead me to the Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Have at thee, you rabble. We, the Templars shall send you to hell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Vier...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I know. The civilians are being evacuated as we speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You don't have to tell me. I know how you like things done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Isn't it wonderful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Leg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Isn't that right, Acht?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>On it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Urgh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Gyaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Radiator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Please go, Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Acht.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>He's ahead, isn't he? Our first enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yes... The one who counted ten...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I promise to catch up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Do I look generous enough to let you, human?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Hahahahaha! I can infinitely summon the Phantom Soldiers of Veda!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Much like a tower from which the chocolate flows ceaselessly for the purpose of covering strawberries! Hahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Do you mean like a chocolate fountain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Yes! That! Ones at parties and such! I can make Phantom Soldiers flow as the chocolate do from those fountains!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You are so loud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Grrroooooorghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>A-asteroids?! Here underground?! I-i-i-impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Waaaaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>May you rest in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Füry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>The evacuation is complete. The people of Lost Blue are safe. As is my store's sign.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Well, aren't you the model shopkeeper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I will keep our family safe, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>We'll see you later, Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I'll be back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>We will eliminate the remaining enemy forces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Leave it to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Heheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You're quite resilient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Who do you think I am?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Our enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Though I am a mere fragment of my true self, I will not be bested by mere humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Show me the indomitable will of humans as your little world falls around you. That is my pleasure, my delight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Oh, I also like sweets, by the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>The end of the world is inevitable, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You will not be the one to do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>That is our job as the Templars.</td>
