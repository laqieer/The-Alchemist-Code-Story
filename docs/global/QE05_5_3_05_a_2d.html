<td>Agatha, I know you're worried. We're all worried. I just... I think it's too dangerous for you to be up there. Could you come down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Mocca. I don't mean to make you worry, but... I just have this feeling like... Like maybe there's something I can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Agatha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>There's a voice... I can hear its echoes...deep within my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's telling me that I already have the power to do it; to fulfill...that wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wh-what is that? Look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Now what's happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The Jam are emerging from the roots of the withered Sephiron!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What the hell? The ground is shaking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Move, Logi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What? Ungh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The Jam? Are they coming out of that hollow? Isn't that where the arboreal altar is supposed to be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>At this rate...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Dias! Gnrk! More of them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>N-no... Logi! Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Agatha, get down! How could that power reach us, even here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ag...a...tha. That's... That's right. My name is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I...am a descendant of the royal family of Wratharis, and I carry a Sacred Stone within me... Satna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ahhhh! Nooo, I can't... No, father! Father! Logi? Dias?! Why...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>All I ever wanted was for us to be a family! That's all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Enough! I keep losing the people I love, and I'm tired of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We've all worked so hard to try to reclaim the happiness we used to share!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This can't be how it ends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It just can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This...feeling...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's the same as before... Could this be the power of Satna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Beware the lure of the Stone. It seeks to enter this world via your desires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Still, I... I want to save Logi and Dias.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>There must be some way to prevent them from dying. Please, Satna! Lend me your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Save us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>This light...! Not the Sacred Stone! Agatha, stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hm. I believe this is my...second time...being resurrected with Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>My axe is as light as a feather in my hand, my body feels almost as buoyant, and this strength welling up within me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Sabareta... Of course that little brat has some dream of restoring Wratharis to its former glory. The forbidden fruit tastes sweetest, as they say...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's unusual for General Vlad the Thunderer to wax poetic, if I do say so myself. Nonetheless, I must add that I would opt for a more profitable venture, if it were me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, Anastasia! I certainly was not expecting to be met with the secret weapon of Wratharis! What an unexpected delight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Make no mistake. I am here only because I was called.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Then I shall leave custody of this one with you. I do think that the front lines seem far more fitting a place for me, myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Glurrrrrp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Always with the battlefields... Well, I suppose I might as well introduce myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I am General Vlad, The Thunderer; one of Wratharis' Deadly Trio!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>My name is not nearly as well-known, but there was a time that I was called Blossom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Wh-what...? This is... Agatha, you... You transmuted these Phantoms?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Please, will you lend me your strength?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Of course, Miss Agatha! You've become such a lovely young lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You...know me? Oh, of course... I...really am of Wratharis' royal line, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We can talk about all this later. For now, we'd best head for the front.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hah. Those two are a little excitable at the idea of being out on the battlefield again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>If we dally around here too long, they're going to hog all of the glory of battle for themselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>No! It's too late, we won'tâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>How reckless of you, heirs of the Blood Wolf, Zeke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Y-you...! It can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That mastery of ice techniques... You're...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I am General Neville, the Ice Snake. This battlefield is now mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What are you doing here? And more importantly, why are you willing to help us now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hmph. Be grateful for the mercy and affection our new master harbors for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>New...master? You can't mean... Not Agatha?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Troops, hold fast! No matter how many enemies we may face, there is nothing to fear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I shall show you what a true battle looks like, when waged by a general who understands tactics!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Impossible...! Where did you come from?! Which Alchemist transmuted you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That voice of hers... We had been waiting for it for so long, and so we answered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We, who carry blood-stained swords and souls twisted with rage... We came in to answer the voice that begged earnestly for our aid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>We could not call ourselves knights if we failed to respond to that cry of grief!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>For that reason, today we come to you, not as the Deadly Trio, but as knights who have set aside their wrath!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Phantoms? Kamui, did you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>No, it was not my doing. However, it seems they are here to help us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I am General Caesar, the Demon Flame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I was once a knight of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>We pledged our loyalty to the royal family of Wratharis, and our oath compels us to do what we can for her now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You will regret this!</td>
</tr>
