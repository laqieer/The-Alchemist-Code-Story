<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ug...gfff... Where...am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Are these Greed Dike soldiers?! They're all frozen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...Morningâ™¡</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wha...! Huh? Othima...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Come on. I'm the one who's surprised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You were supposed to have gone with Kagura and I find you sleeping here. Did you get sick of your mission and run away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We realized you were surrounded by Greed Dike soldiers, so we rushed over here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's right! I was blown away by Kagura's Vermilion Bird and...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Why would Captain Kagura do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Othima, Kagura is in danger! She's currently engaged in battle with a man called Sol!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Sol...?! Here's already made it to Saga?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes! And the Greed Dike soldiers also appeared! We need to hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Clam down! It's all right. Captain Yauras is headed there. The worst has been averted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You don't understand! This all happened after Captain Yauras joined us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You don't mean...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>She was killed! By this Sol fellow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Wa-wait...please...! Are you saying that Captain Yauras is dead?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What I'm saying is that Kagura is in danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Captain Yauras protected us...and she was killed in such a horrible way! Ohh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No...it can't be true! Captain Yauras!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>....I'm sorry. We'll have to change our plans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The fact that Captain Yauras and Kagura placed their lives on the line so that she could escape...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It means there's something they wanted Northern Pride to know about. Correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Y-yes. Greed Dike is headed to Northern Pride. She wanted me to pass that on to Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Understood. Basheeny...sorry, do you think you can take Almira to Northern Pride?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh...?! Wait, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>She's witnessed Sol's way of fighting. I'm certain that information will be of an assistance to Kanon. You understand, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And...what will you do Captain Othima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm going to head straight to Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It still remains that if the Matter falls into their hands, it will place us at a serious disadvantage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>This is just my intuition...but I believe that the Matter will be the determining factor of this war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Understood. I have...one request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>A request...? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Please, act rationally. You portray yourself as calm and collected, but, in fact, you are the most emotional one of us, Captain Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...Basheeny, there's one thing I have to tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm both your superior in age and in rank. I'm the one who's supposed to be handing out the warnings, not the other way around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Haha. I'm joking. Don't worry...appearances aside, I do actually happen to be a captain, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>With the world verging on a crisis, I won't be so idiotic as to let my personal feelings get the better of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Right, of course. Sorry. I spoke out of turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>No, not at all. Your concern means a lot to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well then...if you encounter Orion's main forces, don't take any risks. It's best to avoid conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wait for the right moment to launch an ambush in Northern Pride...understood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yes. Please, be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yes, yes. Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...Time is of the essence. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Honestly, I'm not a very good captain, am I? Sorry for always lying to you...Basheeny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. My patience has worn out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...Unfortunately, I really don't think I can restrain myself any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Meanwhile...at the Earth Temple in Saga region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Agghhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ug-gh...! M-my people...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Looks like a great many of them have been blown to oblivion. What's your next move? Do you want to continue?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...Uck...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You don't have to hand me your Matter if you don't want to, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'll just need to slowly pry it out of you after I kill all your people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>All right...we've lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Sorry, I couldn't hear you. Do you want me to transform this entire landscape into a blazing field of fire?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I surrender! It's pathetic, really... My power alone is not enough to protect my people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>In order to prevent the destruction of my tribe...I will give you my Matter! So, please...no more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Tehre...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hmph. A wise choice. You managed to avoid utter annihilation. You can leave now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...?! Yo-you're not going to...kill me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Kill you? Of course not. You're my insurance just in case something goes go awry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Your insurance...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>There's always the possibility that you've set safeguards on this Matter of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>If I gather all four and nothing happens, then I will personally visit each of your factions and wipe them off the face of this earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I'm going to use the power your Sprites possess to evoke your Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Ack! W-we will never do...something so...despicable...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Tehre...! Hu-hurry...tend to his wounds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...Agh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>So this one of the Matters... Three more to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...!!! Wh-what have you done...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Hey...I obtained one of the Matters. Look. It's got quite the glow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Why?! You said you were going to have a discussion in order to resolve this matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>This is my way of holding a discussion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What idiots. If they'd given it to me from the start, no one would've had to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>What exactly is that you people want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Look at all the lives you've sacrificed! You've thrown the entire world into chaos!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>With all the power you have, what more could you desire?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...What I desire, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I told you earlier. What I desire is the Lost Blue...this beautiful deep blue landscape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>The blue landscape...?!</td>
</tr>
