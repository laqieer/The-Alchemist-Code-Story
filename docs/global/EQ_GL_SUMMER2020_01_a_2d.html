<td>Hmm, Eira has been spending more and more time up in those mountains lately</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I do hope she's alright. What could she be doing up there all by herself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...hnnn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Surely this isn't the limit of your power? If you can't even best this level of flames, how will you ever reach your full potential?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Focus on the image of ice. Feel the magic condense within you, then draw it forth and release it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...together ...now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Awoooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...eyy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>*pant pant*</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>... Eira... do well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That was wonderful Eira! You really have improved your control over your magical strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Its impressive that you managed to conjure this much frost despite the heat I was releasing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Not to mention the teamwork with your fellow companions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Arf arf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yay! big sis... Thank!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's my pleasure to help. All I did was teach you to manipulate your latent magic anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Besides, it does get rather dull up on this lonely mountain. No one else would visit me here anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>... Mmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>... Idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...visit ...big bro ...big sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(Siblings? Is she referring to other human companions?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Eira... humans don't take well to my presence. You've already witnessed how easily they fall to temptation around me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...Good people ...kind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No... trouble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(She seems pretty fond of these friends. And she considers them brother and sister too... as she does me)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, I guess I don't have much reason to decline, I'll be in your care then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>... yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Still, it wouldn't do to leave the village unguarded in your absence. Shall we weed out the local monsters before we take our leave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>... Eira... ready!</td>
