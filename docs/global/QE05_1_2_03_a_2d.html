<td>I had no idea there was a hollow space like this within Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The arboreal altar is where the druidic priestess offers prayers to channel prophecies from Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Can we...go in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This space has always been open to us villagers. It's often used as a place to discuss important matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>However, are you certain this is where you heard the voice from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Kamui? Hisham? What are the two of you doing here at this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Miss Malta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, did I not tell you? I am the druidic priestess of this village. I have the honor of being the altar's caretaker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No way, you didn't say anything about that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Malta, it is unusual for you to be here at this time as well. The hour for prayers is long over. Have you had some kind of prophecy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yes, I was drawn here because I had an ominous sense that something was happening. Sephiron seems to be...crying out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You felt it as well? What could this mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>As well...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes. Hisham said he heard a voice coming from Sephiron, calling him here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I've never heard of such a thing, but the altar does seem to be emitting a strange aura tonight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wh-What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hisham?! What is it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What is this...voice...in my head?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Father...? Mother?! No... Why is the village on fire?! I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What is this darkness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Sephiron's powers of purification are reacting to the darkness?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Kamui! You must remove Hisham from the darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The village... My home?! Th-that... That can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The Jam?! How could the Jam get inside Sephiron?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'll figure that out later—I must prioritize rescuing Hisham!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Nngh... Disperse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Was that the last of it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Not yet! The darkness has yet to release Hisham!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No, I won't make it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This is...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>S-someone, please save—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Leave no survivors! Loot their homes and then set them on fire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Spare none associated with the rebel forces, even the women and children! Kill all who have laid witness, as mercy will only make more trouble for us later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Are these...Hisham's memories? Was his village razed by the soldiers from Gluttony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Survivors! Let none escape alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Urk...! The heat of the flames, the stench of blood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This is likely all just an illusion, but it feels so real. If I'm injured here, what will happen to my physical body?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I have no idea what is happening here, but...I know I cannot afford to die in this place.</td>
