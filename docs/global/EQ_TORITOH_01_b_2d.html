<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What's so funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Nothing. It's just that it's been so long since I could talk to anyone like this... I'm kind of happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're a weird one, to feel something like that about the person trying to take your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You just don't seem like that bad of a person, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Am I really your target? Or is it actuallyâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's none of your business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Heh heh. You're really sticking to your guns, but I think fate has something else in store for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Shut up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hee hee. Getting so upset won't get you any closer to taking me down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What are you smiling for? Are you trying to act all composed or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Nothing like that. I'm just happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(What's wrong with her? Even after I said I was aiming to take her life, she still...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(She's all alone, fated to be nothing but a tool used for others' purposes. How can she...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(Ugh. So annoying.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Let's end this already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Enough, Basheeny. There's another presence nearby. Retreat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There will be another chance. We must accomplish our mission at all costs. Retreat and collect your thoughts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You have some amazing luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Will you come visit me again, Basheeny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(She's still smiling.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Next time, there won't be a reprieve like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Basheeny, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It would be nice if fate brought our paths together again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So, the information was leaked?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>When I think about it, from that point on, the Holy Order was no longer a monolith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But I had been all alone, so there's no way I could have known, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>To think that Lord Commander Basheeny could act like a common killer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Lord Commander...Basheeny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>He's the 12th Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Aha... Hahaha. I was right. He wasn't a bad guy after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So that must mean I ended up coming here before our fates could intertwine again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Does that mean that you didn't end up here by Lord Commander Basheeny's hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Right. That was just a preface to the story that explains why I'm here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The real issue is that there is someone I want to save, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>There was another who was brought here and trapped while still living, like me... My only friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Saving her is what I believe to be the end game my fate is leading me toward!</td>
