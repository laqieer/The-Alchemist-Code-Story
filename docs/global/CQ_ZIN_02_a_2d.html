<td>He put down his weapon in the middle of battle?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I've had enough. There's no point in fighting someone who won't show his true power. My blood isn't going to boil through a lukewarm fight like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What the...?! I haven't been holding back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>They may seem similar, but holding back and just not fighting seriously are different things. I'm bored with this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm hungry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Do you want a rice ball? Wadatsumi's pickled plum rice balls are the most delicious, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>How can you be so easygoing after you just swooped in here and attacked me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, so you really are hungry. You want to split it with me? I'll share if you will fight me seriously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I have no need for your charity. Moreover, I was fighting seriously. I'm fairly sure I already said that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmph. So what is is that binds you, then? Demonic Killer Jin, of the Kagomurasaki... The man who killed his whole family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You know who I am?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Don't get all up in arms over it. I said it before: I search for strong people to fight. I have no intention of trying to capture you or anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You should be able to tell that just by looking at me. For a guy who bears the dishonor of killing his whole family, you seem to be pretty limited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Aren't you free from the law now? What is tying you down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It has nothing to do with you. It is my burden to carry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You're really boring, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What is that supposed to mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Remember what led Wadatsumi down this road to destruction? It was too bound to laws and traditions. It couldn't defend itself against new power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So what it needs isn't law or tradition. What Wadatsumi needs is genuine strength. That's what I'm aiming to prove.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Power and strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Gyahahahaha! No matter what time or world, it's always the same. The strong shall rule. That's the natural order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Jin, what are you living for? Surely it's not just to keep being trapped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Heh. Guess it's not nothing. I suppose I'll have you show me directly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Let's do this for real this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Like I said, I was...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Just two, huh? You've ended up in our territory. There's no way we're just going to let you run home without punishment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What are you going on about? I have no business with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Playing dumb won't get you anywhere. We're truly worried about Wadatsumi and we won't let you stand in the way of our conquest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>With our power, we will restore Wadatsumi to glory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We'll eliminate anyone who stands in our way! That's our style! Now die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(They're not inclined to listen to a word we say. There're too many of them. This is going to be annoying. Rushing in head first would be moronic.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(For now, I have to weather this storm, and...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hahaha! Talking about conquest in front of me takes some guts! That's way too big of a task for some simple bandits like you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Y-you... What are you thinking?! You intend to rush them head-on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Of course! That's my style!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Do you not value your life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This is hardly a big deal for someone as strong as me! Someone who would show their back to an enemy couldn't conquer anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>My name is Zangetsu! I'm the man who is going to rule over Wadatsumi, and one day, the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We'll just have to figure out which of us is worthy of ruling this world! I'll show you my conviction!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Zangetsu, you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>(For now, I have to weather this storm.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>(Huh?)</td>
