<td>Has Nimul really been corrupted?! Seriously?!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Adaleigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Eulalia is doing what she can to purify the corruption, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>"Those who have succumbed to corruption can never return to what they were." That's what she said, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes. That is the conclusion that generations of Sephira reached after countless failures to change the inevitable...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This means that Nimul's already...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>C'mon, Nyx! Don't say such a thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Seriously. Seriously?! We finally figure out how to defeat the Cursed Beasts and set off to save their homeland, and then this happens?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I...failed Nimul when he needed me most.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If only I were stronger... No, why didn't I shield his body with my own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Waginau...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Are you all friends of Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Eulalia! How is he doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>He is stable at the moment, but the corruption is still eating at his body...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No matter how much of my powers of purification I use on him, I can't stop it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>How much longer do you think he has?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>At most, until sunrise tomorrow. After that, I think Nimul will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...become a Sinner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And there is no way we can heal him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You mean, there is? Let's do it! Anything is better than this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Perhaps...? No. This method is perhaps too extreme...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Eulalia, what are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Those who have succumbed to corruption can never return to what they were. Not... Not in this life, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wait, you don't mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The Reincarnation Ritual. To save Nimul, at this point this is the only way. That is what I believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But our priestess, Emmel, isn't here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That is fine. I can perform the rites. I know them all, same as she does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hey, hey! What the heck's going on here? Someone care to break it down for us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Reincarnation... I've heard that word somewhere before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>In the Avaritia Belt Region, death is not the certain end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>"Reincarnation" in this world means that all people repeat the cycle of life and death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I assume you are referring to a ceremony that facilitates something similar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes, but there is a slight difference. In this case we want to make sure the target is revived in their original form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Let me explain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>In our land of Sephiron, this ceremony is performed if someone who must not die has been inflicted with injuries too dire for healing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It is a ritual that calls forth the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg, and uses the magil of Dragons...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Nidhogg...? You mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Correct. To perform that ritual, we need a priestess who is a Vessel, and the power of the Guardian Dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If we perform it with only one person, we cannot know how effective it will be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>But I do know that if you try to perform such a thing, there is no guarantee that you will live!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Do you think that Nimul would have wanted anyone to give up their life for him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It is fine. I will not die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>How can you be sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Here we have a priestess, remains of Nidhogg, and Matter created from crystallized souls...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>In this sacred place, the spirits of this land will lend me their power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Will you trust me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Adaleigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I don't want Nimul to die. Seeing him become a Sinner is even worse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>If there's a chance to avoid that, I want to try it. You really want that too, don't you, Waginau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I trust you! Nimul spoke so highly of you, Eulalia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>For him to praise you like that means that you're someone who we can trust to do this. It will be fine! Definitely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I feel the same as Mira. I'm sure that Nimul wouldn't want to become a Sinner like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Mira... Nyx...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Is there anything we need for the ritual?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Yna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>My apologies for my unwillingness to accept reality, but it's too difficult for me to accept losing a friend such as Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I want to do everything I can to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I see... All of you are right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I wish to fight alongside Nimul again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Thank you, everyone. We don't need anything else to prepare for the ceremony, though. As I said, we already have all we need right here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>There's just one thing. For the duration of the ritual, neither Nimul nor I can move from this holy place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You mean we have to hold down the fort, right? We should prepare in case any more Sinners attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Then there is much for us to do. The enemy has already discovered this place, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I think so. If that lady comes back, it'll be a problem for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>She came here using by manipulating space, didn't she? We can prepare for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yep! Just leave all the Space-Time matters up to me and Nyx!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Actually, we had a pretty poor showing before... We better do better this time around or Ambrosia will somehow find out and scold us to death!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Just imagining it gives me the shivers... We absolutely can't mess this up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>So, it's settled! I'll make sure to unload the Engineer Soldiers from the airship...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Ah... Lady Eulalia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Oh! What happened? You're injured...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I'm sorry... But we need your help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Calm yourself, warrior of the Sephira! Settle down and report what happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Lord Waginau? You've really returned! That is a relief!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>A short while ago, the temporary settlement in the desert was attacked by swarms of Sinners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>We are defending ourselves with all we have available, but against their numbers our lines will surely fall...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>At this rate, we can only last one more day or so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>And until this point, Sinner attacks have been haphazard, and not necessarily targeting people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Yet these Sinners moved and acted as if they were trained as a military force!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Soldiers? That's right, Julia was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Ugh... But now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>For this to happen right as we have to perform the ritual...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>It's as if they predicted that this happen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>But there is no way that we can just let those in the desert weather this alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Not in spirit, and not in force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Are you expecting me to make this decision?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>It was Nimul that brought us this far. We were all supported by his conviction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>But now that Nimul is unable to lead, we need someone else to do so in his place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>The most appropriate person for this is the person who has followed Nimul longer than anyone... That is what I believe, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I have no objection. Even back in Acedia, Waginau's leadership was top-notch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I don't know if I agree... Well, it's better than Nyx could do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Anything's better than being commanded by Mira. All her orders are nonsense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Well, ahem, seems like we're all on the same page. Is it too heavy a burden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>So many are looking to me for direction... This is my first experience with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>When I think about it, I was always behind Nimul, offering him support. I believed that was my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>So I don't have the same conviction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>The resolve to save our home; to overcome the world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Nor have I fangs sharpened for revenge against a world that treats its people as dispensable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I can't match that same steel-tempered passion and single-mindedness in purpose to defeat the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I only have the obligations I have always had as a man of Sephira. I always admired Nimul and his fierce pursuit of his ideals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>But to have Nimul taken away from us; the man who led us this far...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>What I have isn't determination, nor is it resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>It was...inertia, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Even though the Gula Belt is my home. It is mine to defend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>So...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>All right. I will take command!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Our goal is to save everyone, in all regions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>(That is what Nimul wanted. So...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Let's head to the desert. I will save as many people as I can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Okay, that's the plan! Hang tight while I bring the airship over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>We've gotta practice some counter attacks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>We'd better prep Libra. We don't know what might happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I will wield my blade as I always do. Will things be fine here without us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Of course! When the ceremony is completed, Nimul and I will join you all. I promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Then you should have this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>A bow...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Nimul and I constructed it using data we collected from our battles with Cursed Beasts. The gear of judgment, Sagittarius.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Even when used with standard arrows, it is quite a capable weapon. Should you need to use it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Let's set off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Yes, hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Pitiful. This is the best the warriors of the Sephira have to offer once they've lost the advantage of being on their own soil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Glurrrrrp!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>No fear! Press forward! This is the end for us if we let them break us here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Ah... At this rate, we're...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Pathetic... If this is all, then I shouldn't have even bothered to come myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>...That sound...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>This is bad! The defenders have been pushed so far back, the Sinners are nearly at the settlement!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>We're here to stop that from happening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Mira, Nyx. Is your attack ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Yes, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Waginau, you've got some pretty crazy ideas, you know? It's like you have a bit of Nimul in you now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Don't say that! Yna, are you ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Yes. I am ready to depart at any time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>All right, we're off then. Adaleigh and the others will provide backup from the airship!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Roger! Opening the hatch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Oh, he's shaking in his boots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Mira, that's the kind of thing you politely pretend not to notice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>I'm just preparing myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>My word...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Ugh... This is...it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Urk... Yes, we were in a hurry, but perhaps there was a better plan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>S-soldiers attacking from the sky? What in the... Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>That was much worse than I'd had imagined. The wind technique we're using as a buffer is also unstable. That's another worry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>I told you! I'm bad at normal magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Anyhow, I've finished setting up the spatial connection with Libra! Now you'll be able to hear us wherever you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Great. Then... Now, Adaleigh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Roger! Deploying Engineer Soldiers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>I thought that they'd come, but a surprise aerial attack? However—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Despite losing your leader, you still dare to come face us, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>We won't give up yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Ridiculous. Do you really think you can handle us with your meager forces?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Underestimate us and you'll be in trouble. Let's show her the power that felled two Cursed Beasts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Oh, maybe this will be interesting after all. I accept your challenge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>I know her... I know Julia's swordsmanship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>I should be able to fight against her. So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Everyone fall back! I will take over.</td>
</tr>
