<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Mocca... I'm sorry about what I said earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No, I'm the one who should be apologizing. I shouldn't have flown off the handle like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Heh... Heheh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>H-hey... What's so funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Nothing... I just thought it was kind of silly that we're apologizing to each other at a time like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I guess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
