<td>Haa... I really hate this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>There's nothing worse than having to go out in public, of all places... Ugh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I only agreed to help out because they needed someone. So why...how...did this happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Neica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Didn't you have fun decorating and painting the Easter eggs with us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I definitely did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well... I can't say that I didn't enjoy doing all of that, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Besides, an Easter Festival sounds like so much fun, doesn't it?! Aren't you excited?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I heard that there's going to be an Egg Hunt, a Spoon Race, and even egg rolls!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yep! Aren't eggs just amazing?! You can do so much with them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmm... I thought that if you put on a costume, you'd start getting into the spirit of things, but it doesn't seem to be working.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Maybe the clothes aren't for her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The clothing doesn't have much to do with it. Neica has trouble leaving the house, so the moment we tried to get her out of her comfort zone, we'd already lost her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Come to think of it... Neica, didn't you say something in your letter about stalkers harassing you and giving you trouble?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Yeah... They've got my house surrounded, and they keep ambushing me. They shout things at me like, "Don't hide your Neica Powers from the world!" It's been horrible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>O-oh, no! That's terrible! I had no idea...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Well... I wasn't brave enough to refuse, so they did succeed in dragging me out with them a few times...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Oh, Neica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Haa... Why does Easter even exist in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's a great question! I've never really thought about that before. I wonder why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>According to an ancient text in Gluttony Foss, the revival or recreation of what is known as the Festival of Plentiful Harvests is what led to the creation of this event!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Furthermore, eggs and bunny rabbits are apparently considered symbols of the plentiful harvest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Then, you know... A little while back, everyone was saying that it would be your powers, Neica, that would make Gluttony Foss bountiful again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Someone even dressed up like you, and wore clothes patterned with eggs and rabbits...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And that's how the tradition of casting magic on the Imperial Easter Egg came to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Now, instead of praying for a good harvest, most people are more excited about what costume the person playing Neica will wear, and about watching the magical ceremony!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wow! Pam, you sure know a lot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Heheh... I'm not finished! Apparently, something very special will be resurrected over Easter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh? Like what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Umm... Well, that's not the point! All that matters is the hopeful story of "the resurrection of something dear!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Anyway, it sounds like I don't actually need to be the one to cast the magic, since someone else is playing the role for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Besides, I can't just go around letting people know that I'm the real Neica. They don't understand Phantoms—they'd be scared witless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Pfft! Witless, schmitless. You're already here for the Festival, and you're participating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It goes without saying that you should be the one to show up onstage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Are you even listening to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>And you were the one who made the Imperial Easter Egg, weren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That means you should totally be the one to finish it off with your magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You know what they say: work once begun should not be left undone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You said it, Fujika! And you know what, Neica? Sometimes it's important to stand your ground!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You gotta put your all into those prayers for a bountiful harvest and the resurrection and cast your magic on the Imperial Easter Egg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Cause the main event of this festival is all about you! You don't get to be the center of attention very often, so why don't you just enjoy this occasion to the fullest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ugh, I'm telling you I don't want to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Casting magic surrounded by huge crowds of people... I feel sick just thinking about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>At least let me do it where nobody can see me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Dressing up and using my powers in front of everyone... That's just too much to ask from a homebody like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well... If you really can't do it, then I guess that's that. It's such a shame, though. The star of the show was finally here in person and everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hmmm... It seems to me that drastic action is required! Let's go and have a look at the stage, and try and get you excited about standing up there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You're totally right! Come on, Neica, let's give it a go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm telling you, it's not that simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Off we go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>H-hey! There's no need to push! Jeez...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! How are you enjoying your Easter so far? Well, get your thinking caps on, because it's time for the long-awaited Egg Hunt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Our staff have put their all into hiding these adorable little Easter Eggs all over town! Happy hunting, and good luck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Haa... Everyone looks like they're having a great time. Can't I just watch them as an innocent bystander?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wow! Check out the stage! It's amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The Imperial Easter Egg is so pretty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>So, think you'll be able to enjoy yourself a little up there, Neica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>For the main event, you get to stand up there and use your powers on the Imperial Easter Egg in front of—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Ughhh... You're giving me a stomachache. Huh...? That's strange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>That egg... I didn't make it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Are you saying it's a fake?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>How can that be?! The right one was up there this morning, wasn't it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Calm down, Pam! It probably just rolled off somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Something that big doesn't just go missing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I guess so... I mean, the very fact that someone put a fake one up there probably means that something is going on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Not to mention that I enchanted the egg so that it wouldn't move, just like the Easter superstitions say to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Speaking of enchantments, I detect traces of magic being used here... Do you think a talented conjurer could have removed your magic, Neica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>No... The way to remove it can only be found in a certain ancient document, and not many people even know that it exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Besides, I've never heard of anyone wanting to interfere with this festival. Isn't that strange?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You seem flustered, ladies. Did something happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Huh?! T-Te...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Te... Te—Teona?! Wh-wh-what are you doing h-here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>We're here as security. We've blended in among the crowd of onlookers to prevent any trouble from occurring at this festival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Every year, there has been at least one case of a big fight breaking out over who found an egg first, and things like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>R-really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Everything looks fine for the moment, however, so we have simply been enjoying ourselves perusing the stalls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>So... Why don't you tell us what's going on with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>W-well... We just discovered that the egg Neica made has been...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>H-how is that possible?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>This is quite the surprise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Lotiyah! Let us help them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>All right. First thing's first, could you please describe this missing egg for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Sh-she's so close... Too close... I can't believe I'm standing so close to T-Te—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Ahem. Neica...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I actually get to meet her...to talk to her. I need to calm down. I need to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Erm... Neica? Are you listening to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Y-yes! A description! Of the egg! Well... It's about the same size as whatever that man over there is holding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You there! Halt!</td>
