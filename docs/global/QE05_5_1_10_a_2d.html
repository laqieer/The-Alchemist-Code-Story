<td>There! That must be the Liberation Army's camp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Take the carriage to the back of the formation. Be sure to keep it away from any water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Kamui! Glad to see you've made it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Sorry to make you wait, your Highness. We've brought all that we could carry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Now, the question is simply whether it will work or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It worked on some of the Jam we encountered along the way. If there're no differences in the individual creatures, it should work just fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Were you able to prepare what we discussed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes, we managed to build several large catapults. We've also issued slings to each soldier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But...these still may not be enough to cover the entire battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Don't worry. I have an idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Is there something I can do to help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Perfect! Wind like this should be able to carry the agent anywhere on the battlefield!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wind Ouija isn't really meant to be used like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sorry, but we have to use what we can, however we can. We'll need you to deliver the drying agent throughout the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Using Ouija over such a large area would cost me a lot of energy. I'd only be able to do it a few times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Mocca should be getting here sometime soon. Wouldn't it lighten your load if you two took turns over time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Maybe, but I'll have to work alone for a while either way, won't I? Ugh, this is going to suck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We'll need you to coordinate the details of the distribution, Adelbert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Me? I feel like I should be on the front lines leading the soldiers, as their commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ceclidis is at the arboreal altar beyond the ruins of the Sephira village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The Sephira village is well hidden. Someone who knows the terrain should stand at the front.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Very well. Then I'll leave the soldiers to you, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's for the best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Here's the plan... First, Logi and I will lead the Blue Tongues to the base of Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That will draw the Jam out to face you, won't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's what I expect. Ceclidis uses the Jam as extensions of his own limbs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Once we engage, I'll use Spiritbonding to raise hell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's when we'll use the catapults and Tina's Ouija to rain down the drying agent, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Speed is key for this plan. We only have a limited amount of drying agent, andâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The resurrection ceremony...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If what we heard at the royal capital is true, the completion of the ceremony would mean their powers will grow exponentially.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Not to mention, Marie's safety will be at stake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Exactly. We will charge deep into their formation and disrupt their plans as quickly as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And if possible, we will take Ceclidis out on the spot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>He is the source of Jam in this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Removing him from the equation should rid us of all the Jam, if not weaken them significantly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That would help us end this conflict very quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Exactly. Now, let's get everything ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Logi, are you ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes, as are the Blue Tongues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Are you worried about Agatha and Dias?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Dias said he would not fight with us, did he not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>He's always been so hardheaded. He never goes back on his word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Agatha used to be able to drag him out no matter what, but I'm not sure if she can do so in her current state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Don't worry, Logi, I've already advised her on the matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We'll head out if you're ready. We'll take the shortest route possible to Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Y-yeah!</td>
</tr>
