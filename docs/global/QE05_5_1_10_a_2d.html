</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>That's what I expect. Ceclidis uses the Jam as extensions of his own limbs.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Once we engage, I'll use Spiritbonding to raise hell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>That's when we'll use the catapults and Tina's Ouija to rain down the drying agent, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Speed is key for this plan. We only have a limited amount of drying agent, andâ€”</td>

<td>The resurrection ceremony...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>If what we heard at the royal capital is true, the completion of the ceremony would mean their powers will grow exponentially.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>Not to mention, Marie's safety will be at stake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Exactly. We will charge deep into their formation and disrupt their plans as quickly as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>And if possible, we will take Ceclidis out on the spot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/logi.png" alt="Logi" height="128"><br>Logi</td>
<td>He is the source of Jam in this country.</td>
</tr>

<td>Removing him from the equation should rid us of all the Jam, if not weaken them significantly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>That would help us end this conflict very quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>

<td>You have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>We'll head out if you're ready. We'll take the shortest route possible to Sephiron.</td>
