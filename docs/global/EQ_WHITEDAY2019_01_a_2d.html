<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>The boys are on tenterhooks and the girls are all of a flutter... The whole town is in a lovey-dovey mood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oooh! I love it! This is the best! This is a day for all the lovebirds in the city!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Today, those whose hearts are as one will be happily wed at last... Hooray for White Day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Speaking of lovebirds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The first pair to come to mind are Eve and Fraise! I wonder how they'll spend their time together today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>They're an OTP, my ideal couple, so I'm sure they'll make the best of this wonderful day, but...I can't help feeling curious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I know! I'll go ask Fraise what he plans to do today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hey there, Fraise! I was hoping we could have a little chat about White Day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, oops! Didn't mean to bother you if you were in the middle of something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Do you know this girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>She's my friend's little sister. It's good to see you again, Moa. This is Gino, my younger brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh! Hi! Nice to meet you. My name is Moa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I don't care for introductions. I only came here to issue you a warning...Brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? A warning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's right. Fraise, I'm here to tell you not to get carried away with a stupid convention like White Day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>H-hey! What is that supposed to mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Exactly what it sounds like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Soldiers who absorb themselves in affairs of the heart soon grow weak, becoming the laughing stock of their peers. Hence my warning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hey... Don't you think it's kinda harsh to start with that right off the bat, after being summoned here as a Phantom Soldier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Besides, you know what, Gino? I think my feelings have actually made me stronger, so today is pretty important to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What is wrong with you? You're not making any sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Maybe you'll understand it for yourself someday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Moa... I have a favor to ask you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm all ears!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I don't want to trouble you, but do you think you could keep an eye on my little brother for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>M-me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>He became a Phantom Soldier only recently, so there's a lot he doesn't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I should really be the one to show him the ropes, but he won't listen to me at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Besides, I'm sure there are things that he would never share with me, but that he might be able to confide in a stranger about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I can see where you're coming from, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Also... I've got to go and meet with Lady Eve shortly, and I really don't want to keep her waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Why didn't you mention that earlier? I'd be delighted to help out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>All I ask for in exchange is that you share the perfect White Day with Eve! Can you promise me that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Thank you, Moa. And, yes, I think I can manage that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, Gino, I'm heading out for a bit. You two play nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What?! After all that stuff I said, you're just going to go ahead with this White Day nonsense anyway?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Just take it easy, all right? It'll be a while yet before you're accustomed to being a Phantom, and I don't want you getting into any trouble. Now, I'd best be off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Tch. I hate it when he treats me like a little kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Play nice...? It doesn't look like things are going to go that smoothly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Still, there's nothing else for it! Fraise needs to spend time with Eve today, and it's up to me to make sure he can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hey. You're Eve's... I mean, that woman's little sister, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Well, actually, she's my cousin. But she's always been very kind to me, and looks out for me just as if she were my big sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Eve is always smiling! She's the best big sister I could have ever asked for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You don't need to tell me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hey! Fraise! You there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huh? Where'd he go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>He went out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Aw, man... I was gonna get him to help me choose a present, but I guess I must've just missed him, huh? That's too bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>A present? Are you talking about a gift for White Day?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well, uh... Yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh my gosh! So, so! Do you have a juicy love story to share? You've gotta tell me! I need to know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>A love story...? Well, I guess...I just wanted to get something for someone who's very important to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oooh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I heard about how guys are meant to give girls presents on White Day, and thought it'd be as good of an opportunity as any to show how much I appreciate her. I mean, she's always doing things for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I figured Fraise would probably have something for Eve, so I thought I'd ask him how he went about it, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Ugh! For crying out loud! I'm so sick of hearing about this lovey-dovey crap! Just leave me out of it, all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh? What the hell is up with you, man? Who the heck are you, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>This is Fraise's younger brother. I only just met him myself, but he's been angsty like this from the outset. His attitude is really starting to get on my nerves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>His younger brother, huh? Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What? You got something to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Heh. Only that it seems to me that you don't like seeing Fraise get so close to Eve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Tch. So what? I don't have to like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Love just makes people weak. My brother is a shining example of that. Knights don't need to be distracted by such things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>But even after becoming a Phantom Soldier, Fraise keeps fooling around with all this sappy foolishness. It's so sickening, it's not even funny. What the hell is the point? I don't see one, and that's why I don't like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hey! Gino! Where are you going?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Home. I've done what I came here to doâ€”not that it made any difference. My warning clearly fell on deaf ears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Wait! I'm supposed to be looking after you, remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Oh, no... I've lost sight of him! Where could he have gotten off to?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Kevin! Would you mind helping me search for Gino?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Course not. Leaving a lady to deal with her problems alone goes against my principles, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Oho! I dare you to say that again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Fine. You'd better move it, because crowding around outside the sweetshop like that is blocking the sidewalk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Shut your mouth! Girls go crazy for the cookies they sell here. If you want us to move, you're gonna have to make us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>That's easily done. No skin off my back. Beating a bunch of pathetic, perverted weaklings is child's play for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>The hell did you just say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Jeez! That idiot... He needs to learn how to keep a cool head!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Ugh... I might as well be babysitting a goblin! Come on, Kevin. We'd better join him.</td>
</tr>
