<td>O Great Tree of Calamity... Reverse all that has come before!</td>

<td>These guys are practically falling on their swords here! Urgh... Kamui, we won't be able to hold them back forever!</td>
</tr>

<td>003</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>

<td>It looks like we can cut them down, but there's just too many for us to take them on one by one!</td>
</tr>

<td>Something strange is going on here. No matter how many we defeat, they just keep coming.</td>

<td>There are so few Sephira left now. Ceclidis' reach is wide, but I cannot understand how he could bring together so many... It should be impossible.</td>

<td>I told you, Protector. The Sephira are no more.</td>

<td>We are the Fallen! We abandoned our human vessels in our quest for wisdom and truth! We have been reborn into a new form of existence...as the Jam!</td>

<td>That pathetic, quavering anguish on your face... Yes. That is what I like to see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Still, no good thing is made to last. I shall extend you one final mercy. We shall swallow you up and put an end to your suffering!</td>
