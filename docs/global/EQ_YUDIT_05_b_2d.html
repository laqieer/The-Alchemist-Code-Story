<td>(There are some things I can't handle on my own, but that become possible when we all work together. These three taught me that.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(So I want to help them, too, if I can.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(I want to make sure they get to fulfill their vow to create a peaceful future for the continent!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Grrooooghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We brought the Taurus to its knees—but it won't stay down for long. You've got to get to the core!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Leave it to me! With this level of firepower, I'll have no trouble making it up there now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>All right, time to turn the power output on this new mech gear up to max! There's the core—target locked on. Ready, and... Huzzzaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Just...a bit...further!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Grooogh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Grrooooghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Dang it! Guess I didn't hit hard enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>But I'm not going to give up! It's all about trial and error!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Crap! I can't dodge that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Judith! Look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Arghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Basheeny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Grooorgghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hey, Big Horns! Don't go forgetting about us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Time to knock you down again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Grooorgghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>If there're any more errors, Judith, let us take care of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>You just focus on the trial part—and don't give up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Huh. That was a pretty cool one-liner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Don't sound so surprised! I'm a cool guy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You two are awfully chipper. We're fighting for our lives here, y'know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Someone's gotta liven up the mood when Brooding Basheeny's around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Hey! I heard that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Anyway, there's no point freaking out or being all serious in a situation like this. It's not going to make it any easier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Haha. That's not a bad sentiment. The light of the future shines brightest when there's a smile to welcome it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Grooorgghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Hrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Bud! Victor! Basheeny! Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't worry about us—get to the core!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't be afraid. We'll protect you from the Taurus's attacks. All you have to do is jump.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Remember: you're not alone in this. We're here to fight with you. So it's going to be okay. Your Mecha Weapon will get us through this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Grooorgghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Okay... I can do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Grooooooaaarr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Everyone here believes in my Mecha Weapon, so I just have to believe in the future they're going to create!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>A future where my Mecha Weapon can bring smiles to all the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But for that future to be possible... I need to defeat you, here and now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This is it! Huzzaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Grooooooooooooooorrghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Thank you, Judith. We couldn't have defeated the Giant Taurus without your help—or your father's invention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Maybe, but this new-and-improved mech gear wouldn't have been possible without your help, either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I was only able to get it to exert that much power because of your input!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>You guys helped me see that together we really can create a peaceful future for this world! I believe in that now, from the bottom of my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>And in a way... I think the Mecha Weapon responded to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So, really, I should be the one thanking you! Thank you for helping me believe in a better future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Maybe the Mecha Weapon won't even need these new functions anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>After all, in the future you have planned, it won't be a weapon anymore. It'll be something fun—something that creates smiles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Aw, isn't this sweet? Those two are so good together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Sure, but it wasn't always like this, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>When he first met Judith, Basheeny was so hung up on being Lord Commander that he lost sight of the things right in front of him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Don't go sounding all high and mighty! You literally just went through the same thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Give me a break, will you? It's hard to shoulder this much responsibility! It's not easy being captain of the Blue Flame Guard, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But I realized that I shouldn't let my position stop me from caring about the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Envylia is important to me, but it's not the only nation in the world, and its people aren't the only ones who need protection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Protecting the future of this world means protecting everyone, regardless of where they call home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(If Kagura hadn't given me the push I needed to join this mission, I might not have learned all this until it was too late. I'll have to remember to thank her.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>What's that dreamy look for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh?! I-I've got no idea what you're talking about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Oh, really? Those red cheeks say otherwise. I bet you were thinking about Kagura! You always look like that when you're thinking about her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Sh-shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Bud! Victor! You're not arguing again, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Uhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Pfft. Hahaha! I swear, you three are the weirdest friends I've ever met!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But don't get me wrong—I think it's great! 'Cause when the three of you team up, you can help so many people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hey... Basheeny? This is just an idea, but...do you think the Holy Guard would help me research the Mecha Gear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>There's no telling when another threat like the Giant Taurus will show itself in Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Like you mentioned before, for all we know, something even stronger could show up one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I don't think I could deal with that alone, and I don't think the Mecha Weapon would be powerful enough either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>But if we all work together to improve the Mecha Weapon, I truly believe that it could make all the difference!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Judith...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>To be honest, I didn't think a collaboration like that would be possible at first. There are plenty of people in the Holy Guard who don't think the Mecha Weapon should even exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Some people even consider it a cursed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But...I believe in that possibility now. Because I trust you, Basheeny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Are you sure? I haven't fulfilled my vow to bring peace to the world yet. And...I still haven't made good on my promise to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Listen... I haven't forgiven the Holy Guard for killing my father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>But you're willing to shoulder all the hatred and bitterness I feel on their behalf. That means something to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>And seeing you fight to bring peace to the world made me want to help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>So I believe in you, Basheeny. I know you'll keep your promise to me, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You will, won't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I plan to use my report detailing our battle with these new Giant Taurus to promote the use of the Mecha Weapon and start clearing away its negative reputation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>As for your father...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>There were a lot of unnatural circumstances surrounding his sentence. I intend to investigate each of these, and see if I can't find out anything. Perhaps there was some sort of mistake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>It will take time, but I'm sure I can clear his name, too, eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Thank you. I really appreciate that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>But just so you know, it doesn't really matter to me whether my father's name is cleared or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>O-oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Even if we can change the past, it's the here and now that's most important, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>That's why I want to try and find an alternative purpose for the Mecha Weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Maybe even something like what Victor mentioned the other day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>See, he got me thinking... What if I could create a sport that revolved around using mech gear? I could hold tournaments for people to go head-to-head with one another, for fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I could even collaborate with the Holy Guard to determine the basic rules. What do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You know... That could actually work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I think it would be wonderful if we could use the results of our collaborative research to find a way to make the Mecha Weapon a symbol of peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Exactly! In other words, I don't need to feel pressured anymore. The Mecha Weapon's usefulness will be proven in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Because we're going to make it happen! Together, we'll decide what the Mecha Weapon's function should be, and we'll work together to shape it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Judith...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I don't wish to pressure you, and I'd understand if you declined, but if I may... I'd like to see your father's journals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>After all, they might contain valuable information that we could use in our upcoming research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Sure! I trust you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>(There must be something in there about the Cursed Beasts.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>(Whatever it is... As Lord Commander, it's my duty to know about it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Hey... I know that look. I hope you're not thinking of tackling anything dangerous on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>You worry too much, little frog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Don't worry. I have no intention of neglecting the vow we swore together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Good. Don't go forgetting it or anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>(I won't forget. However, I also won't risk exposing you, Bud, Judith, or anyone else to the risks I face going forward.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>In any case... It's time. Bud, Victor... You know what we're doing. Judith, you're in this too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Oh, so we're actually doing it? Awesome!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Okay, fine... It's a bit embarrassing, but...I'll live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Huh? Wh-what're we doing, exactly? Don't keep me in the dark!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Since you've agreed to help us fulfill our vow to protect the world and create a brighter future...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I figured it was about time we swore our vows anew—except this time, you'll be joining us, Judith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>The future has been left in our hands. We have to prove that we can handle that responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Hey! Not again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I was gonna say that this time! Tch... Stupid line-stealer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I'm gonna be the one who protects the peace of Babel, and don't you forget it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>We four shall combine the justice with which we have been entrusted to build a peaceful world. Together, we shall work ever towards ensuring a bright future for Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>(Kanon trusted me to protect this world. To do so, I will need to learn all I can of the Cursed Beasts and the threat they pose, as well as of the history that was buried.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>(This is something I must do, both as Lord Commander, and as the bearer of the sacred sword.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Together we'll work towards forging a Mecha Weapon that can stand up to any threat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Because our goal is to create a future where the my dad's invention is no longer a weapon of mass destruction, but an instrument of fun!</td>
</tr>
