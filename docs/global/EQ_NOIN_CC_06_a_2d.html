<td>003</td>
<td>One's true worth is measured at the twilight of their life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Come, Dead Nine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The Veda Templars... Will they be useful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That is precisely what we shall see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The Sun of Lost Blue, and a fallen king. Let us see who will win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What fool would challenge the Sun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>One who would be burned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The outcome is obvious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That may be true...if he truly is the Sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Whichever way it falls, we will benefit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A sun found underground... Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Nothing for a Lion above ground to fear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>My ninth failure. I figured I wouldn't have another chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm going to climb Veda. No one will come with me. I can't even make it to the hundredth floor again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Everything just returned to how it used to be. Alone in this cesspool, taking on dirty jobs...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Power is everything. I am the law. Nothing has changed about my strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I would have figured I'd be hated by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>By whom?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>By the people of Lost Blue, you lot from Greed Dike...and that cat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The Veda Templars... They have been undertaking all the dirty jobs we have to offer. The higher ups in Greed Dike are beginning to value them greatly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>They haven't missed a single assassination target. Not to mention their efficiency. Not a single trace of them can be found from infiltration to retreat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It has something to do with their dimensional powers, I believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Our payments seem to be providing for Lost Blue pretty well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Heh. I'm losing business, thanks to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Unfortunately, we have ourselves a situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You seem to be doing well from where I stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Those Templars... We believe that each time they work a job on the surface, they are gathering Philosopher's Stones and bringing them back down here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>They've even started demanding that we provide Philosopher's Stones, Sacred Stones, or some treasure of equal standing as payment for their jobs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We have no idea what they are planning, but some have begun seeing them as a threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We have plenty of other mercenaries to call upon in their place. Like you, for example.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>And I assume I'm just as expendable as they are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The annihilation of the Veda Templars before they become a threat against Greed Dike... That is your mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Are you serious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Aren't you the king of Lost Blue?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm no king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The ninth seat is still open.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I thought I won that fight over this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That's why I'm practically begging you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That hard to gather ten members, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I can't ask just anybody. I secured up to eight members just recently, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Why me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I told you, I like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I want you to be the ninth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Welcome back, Zwei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Will you praise her, Sol? She eliminated the most hostiles on the last mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Fabulous work, Zwei!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Oh, um... Thanks, Acht.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Your efforts will not be in vain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Sol, won't you praise me, as well? It's just so hard, taking care of so many of your people all at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>V-Vier...! Do you have to press against him like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hm? Why not? Do you want to join in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I... Uh... No, I'm still sweaty from the mission... So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That's fine. Let's get sweaty together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Wha—?! P-please, Vier! Stop that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>W-will you please at least get off of him?! S-Sol seems inconvenienced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Oh? He looks happy enough to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Um... I-I did my... Uh, best...too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You weren't elegant at all though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>W-well I do curses... So, elegance really isn't... Y-you know...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Well, I was watching you, Füry. Your skills were dazzling, though not as dazzling as mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Dazzling? But... I curse people. I-I don't think I should be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Don't get the wrong idea. There are guys too. They're just not here right now. You think I'm just building a harem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I know how women are treated here in Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>It's rare to see young girls like them smiling the way they are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I can tell you're doing right by them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Dead Nine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I figure this line-up is in consideration for how that one still has issues with men, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Dead Nine... Will you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>No. I won't be your ninth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Dead Nine...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Um... I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Don't worry. You chose this of your own will, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It's not that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I'm almost there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I'll almost be strong enough to help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I'm sorry, for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Nngh?! Aaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Blurgck! Blarglarglarglargh...! Gehck! Ah... Blaaaaaghck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Hey! Rat-Killer?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I-I'm...okay! Gahck! Nng! Blegh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>How did it come to this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Zwei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Blarglarglarglargh! Gah! Bleckh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I need you to get ready for your next mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Nnnf...! Blgh! Bleeeeegh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Hold it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Would you mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Gauntlets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Axe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Get out of my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>I'll hold him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>You don't mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Then, please, take care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>So that's how it is, huh?! You nihilist freak! You just order them around from above, while they get hurt in your stead?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Haa... Haa... Huff... Huff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Dead Nine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>We won't let anybody own us again, remember?! Rat-Killer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Do you intend to kill her?! You're just gonna use her until she's dead?! Are we all just tools to you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>How dare you claim to be the sun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Have you no rules to live by?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Rat-Killer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>What's with all of you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>We're comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Then how can you stand around and let this happen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I will kill those who hurt my friends by any means necessary! That's my rule!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Do none of you feel the same?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I never had anybody I could call a true comrade until I met her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>She puked up nine beers worth of blood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I have to help her! I have to be there for her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>We promised to see the blue sky together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>She was the one who made me understand! Meeting her helped me realize...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>There's no point to anything if you're alone!</td>
