<td>We've arrived. This is the first rendezvous point. According to the plan, this is where we're supposed to meet up with the other captains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey, that's quite a comeback, Seida! We're the first here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It appears so. I can't see any of the other Paladins anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Eeek?! There's more of them, teacher!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yikes, I guess one wasn't enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It makes it easier to take them down. Let's go, Captain Othima!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...?! Seida, behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Disappear with this hammer of justice...Lightning Axe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmph. Not much of an effect for its size.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Vice-Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Othima...make no mistake. I got here first. I just...got a little lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? I was totally the first one here. Why would you tell such an obvious lie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What did you say?! I don't lie! That goes against my Code of Chivalry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There you go again...you chivalrous idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Idiot?! Time and time again you insult me...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Vice-Captain Monzein! There are monsters behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Shut up! Don't call me Vice-Captain! Let Yauras handle that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Scatter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Captain Yauras! Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Monzein...don't just rush forward on your own. Use your head a little more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>My head?! You idiot! It's not like you're a civilian. If you're a knight than you use your arms...ah, no, that's wrong! Right now, my opponent is this weakling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No! The enemies are the goblins! Our priority is to get to Lord Zain, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Keep your bickering for later! Everyone is here now. Let's head forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hey, hold on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Unfortunately, everyone really is here now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ca-Captain Kudan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Where's Kagura...no, where's Zain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...what are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Shut up! I'm the one asking the questions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You scum, I am aware the entire Holy Guard is working together to steal the Mikaboshi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...?! Why do you know about the Mikaboshi...where did you hear it from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Your words give you away. So your aim is the Mikaboshi after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Captain Kudan! No! We're following Lord Zain's orders in order to destroy the Mikaboshi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Tsk...Zain...I guess he's hiding the more important part from the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I don't have time to explain! Get out of the way! Even as we waste time here, Kagura is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I cannot let you pass here. It's for your own good as well, Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>For my own good? What kind of nonsense...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Stand down, Kudan. This is on the order of the Lord Commander. We won't let you pass here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Kagura is being placed in harm's way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Could you stand by and watch someone from your own regiment being placed in that situation?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It's to save the world...Kagura agreed to it too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Idiot. Why won't you realize the truth?! You are all being deceived by Zain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>If you words aren't enough, then I'll get by you with force!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Captain Kudan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Have you forgotten? You've never once won against me before. You're gonna get hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Not you too, Captain Yauras! Please, stop! Lower your weapons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>There's no other choice, Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Let everyone else go first. We'll stave him off here. Hurry to Lord Zain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>No...what's the matter with both of you?! How did it end up like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yauras draws her sword in an attempt to correct Kudanstein's suspicion towards the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>In front of the disappearing Kanon, the two Paladins exchange blows.</td>
