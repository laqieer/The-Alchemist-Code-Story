<td>That's true. But as long as we've got that forbidden power inside of us, the blood in our veins is still demonic. Nothing can change that.</td>

<td>Why would someone born of a demon join the Blade Fox, though? That's the burning question in my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Because even a halfwit like me has hopes and dreams. I couldn't just isolate myself from other people, human or demon. My heart's a little too big to live the hermit life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>All I've ever wanted is to be around others. To laugh, share a meal, and then take a well-earned nap afterwards.</td>

<tr>

<td>I just thought it was really good. There's something special about sitting at a table with friends you've fought alongside against certain death. Not to mention the nap afterwards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>D-did you eat something funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Harsh... Look, all I'm saying is that it doesn't help to overthink things. To overcomplicate matters—</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>It's a very bad habit we humans have.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>

<td>Amane...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/azam.png" alt="Azami" height="128"><br>Azami</td>
<td>That's right. The ones we should be fighting are the ones we always have: the demons who threaten humanity. Our blood merely sustains our lives; it doesn't define it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ugac.png" alt="Ugachi" height="128"><br>Ugachi</td>

<td>Captain Ugachi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ugac.png" alt="Ugachi" height="128"><br>Ugachi</td>

<td>Sorry, Commander Ugachi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/aman.png" alt="Amane" height="128"><br>Amane</td>
<td>Looks like your little anecdote didn't quite have the desired effect, Paragon. Nothing has changed. You are still the only one here we cannot abide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sp_ogre.png" alt="Discarnate Power" height="128"><br>Discarnate Power</td>
<td>That is...disappointing, to say the least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sp_ogre.png" alt="Discarnate Power" height="128"><br>Discarnate Power</td>
<td>But I wonder if you'll still be so accepting should I manage to coax him into revealing his true demon nature. Let's see what it takes, shall we?</td>
