<td>(She's strong...and fast. No one has ever been able to dodge my lance so easily. I don't think she's even breaking a sweat. Still...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Intriguing. I sense something from your lance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Reluctance, and yet also...excitement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huzzzzzaaaaahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Impressive. Yet...lacking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ungh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Give it up. You will only hurt yourself if you attempt to stand. I put a little extra force behind that hit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Let us end this battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(So this is how I die... Felled on the battlefield, just like my father was. It happened so easily, too.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(Somehow, I feel like this is what I have been searching for all this time. What a strange person I am...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Are you not going to strike?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That flower that you carry. I don't mind killing you, but...if I do, the flower will be crushed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Flower...? Oh. This? Lamia's favorite flower...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You... You're the one from Envylia that Lamia talked about? I never imagined that we might meet in a place like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Is it my fate to be forever bound by the ties of pupil and teacher?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Come... Let us relocate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This will do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What is happening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I find my curiosity piqued on two counts. Firstly, regarding your relationship with Lamia, and secondly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>About the warring contradiction that exists within you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Like a cycle that never ends...the conflict that exists within you is reflected in your lance...and within myself, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Within...you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I find myself...resenting battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What?! Then why do you fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I fight...to end battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You...who has been named the Ruinmaker?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That name... I am resigned to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I accept it. Some who hear it are struck dumb with fear, and abandon their weapons and the battle in response. So regardless of whether I harbor doubts about my opponent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I must fight, or else the battles will never end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Thatâ€™s...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I seem to have said too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Let us end this, along with that dilemma lying unresolved in your heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(I cannot defeat her like this. I... I must... Why...do I fight?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Do not weep, daughter. The battlefield is a place for death. Still, we must fight to protect that which means most to us. I leave Envylia...to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I remember now... My contradiction was born that day, when my father entrusted me with this duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I am ready to face you, Theresa. I, too, have something I must do, even if it means that I must face the Ruinmaker to accomplish it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Come, then. Show me what you've got, Priscilla!</td>
