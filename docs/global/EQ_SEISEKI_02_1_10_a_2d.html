<td>We caught up!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ah... So you were the victors. It appears it was I the one who underestimated you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Very well. Attack me if you're prepared to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Agh! What is this power...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't mess with us! Hurry up and give Chihaya back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Kagura! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...?!</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Kagura!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Kagura! Kagura! Stop messing around. Come on. Answer me! Make fun of me like you always do!</td>

<td>Hmph. So, she died. I'm disappointed at how little resistance she put up, but I guess it's more convenient this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I was going to kill her anyway. She had the potential to get in the way of my domination.</td>

<td>Right now, Wadatsumi doesn't need a royal family! All they need is my absolute power and a shrine maiden who they trust in!</td>

<td>He is attempting to reign over the currently desolate Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He wants to do this by joining forces with me and raising me up as a symbol to be worshiped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If the royal family were to emerge now suddenly, it would cause a divide amongst the people who have finally begun to unify.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Besides, don't you feel the same, Shrine Maiden Chihaya? Restoration without power is impossible! It is power that protects the people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>My armed forces will enable that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Chihaya...you're not actually considering what he's saying, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It is true that some of what he says makes sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>However, my power will always belong to the people. I could never lend a hand to someone who schemes to dominate them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Kagura?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hmph. So you're still alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't be deceived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Kagura!</td>

<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You scum! Prepare to pay for your actions.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I see... I guess I won't have to go easy on you. Very well then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Heheheh. Yeah, that's the spirit. Makes it all the more worth defeating you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No, you must not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You must not sympathize with his darkness! It will consume you as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What's the matter, coward? Are you afraid of me? Are you frightened of unleashing your power?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That's it, coward! Let the terror overtake you until you run away with your tail between your legs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Shut up...shut up, shut up, shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ack...ahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Chihaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ka-Kanon...you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I won't let you do this anymore! I'm going to protect the lives and happiness of everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The darkness is being neutralized...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huh? I can move. Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What?! How is this possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>With a heart of justice, you can do anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'll never acknowledge a power that is void of justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Interesting... Well then, show me this justice of yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Happily! Let's go, everyone!</td>
