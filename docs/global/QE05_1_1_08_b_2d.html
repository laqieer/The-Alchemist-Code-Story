<td>This is... No... It's... It's terrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>These people were cut down from behind as they fled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>At least they have not lit this entire place on fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Fire?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Why would they...? There's no need for such brutality!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hisham...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We have finished verifying the situation. It is true that all the villages in the area have been assaulted by the Royal Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We have testimonies from the few survivors we were able to find.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The harbor had already agreed to ally with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>They have secretly been preparing to declare themselves to our side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ceclidis mobilized his forces to wreak vengeance against the harbor as soon as he found out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We separated from our main forces to protect the harbor, some of us setting out this way to secure the road and prevent reinforcements from reaching the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So, thinking we were those reinforcements, you attacked us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I am coming to understand why you rebels—ahem, I'm sorry, the Liberation Army—are so aggressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>As you should! Those bastards destroyed innocent villages nearby just because the harbor chose the South!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What?! So the official military force of this country set fire to the homes of its own people?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes! We can no longer let the North wreak havoc upon our homes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I thought you were opposed to us knowing your country's affairs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Paladins of the Holy Guard, do you not represent justice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If you will not help us, then at least stay out of this civil war! Justice is on the side of the Liberation Army and General Leordas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That soldier was not mistaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We, the Holy Guard, stand for absolute justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We must pass judgment fairly and without bias, never favoring one side over another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Unless, of course, justice would be best served by siding with one side or another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We, the scouting legion, will now fulfill our role as Paladins! Prepare for battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Lord Waginau...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Kamui and Lady Teona, my apologies. I release you from your duties as bodyguards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You will receive payment another day, but for now, leave this place as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(Leave this place? With such tragedies unfolding before us?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(There is a message from King Narol that I must deliver home, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No, I will go with you. I cannot stand by and let such atrocities continue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I have a responsibility as a citizen of this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Please allow me to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Very well. I would be honored if you could lend me your spear for this battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>As a citizen of this country...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Kamui...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hisham. You go along with these villagers to someplace safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We'll be back soon, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Okay. You two be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Are you sure? Do you not have your duties as a Sephira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I do. However, I cannot turn my back on this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>How very noble of you. I suppose we are lucky for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Then let us go! Raise the flag of absolute justice! We now march as blades that protect the innocent!</td>
