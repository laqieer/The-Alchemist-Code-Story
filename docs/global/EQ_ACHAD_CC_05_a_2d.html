<td>001</td>
<td>Mama used to make the same face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You know, papa used to hit mama right in front of me. He'd call mama all sorts of terrible names that I won't repeat here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>He had a few screws loose, I think. He preferred to pretend I didn't exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Over time, my mama's spirit dwindled away. She stopped showing any emotion. Started talking less and less...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>And then she lost control of her own body, because papa crushed her arms and legs, taking care to leave her alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>He was quite the fanatic, I see that now. Always talking about how blood is filthy and flesh is sin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's why papa loved machines. Lifeless. Cold to the touch. Nothing relaxed him more than tinkering to his heart's content.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Mama prayed and prayed for God to strike him down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>And do you know what happened? Papa died! But it wasn't thanks to her prayers. Oh, no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I killed him! I flew into a rage and killed him! Sound familiar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Just kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'd hate to make Sol sad. Wouldn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You know, I thought mama would be happy if I killed papa for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I really did. I was sure she'd thank me. Stroke my hair. Hug me close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Instead, she lashed out at me. She clawed at me until  her nails started to peel and break.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I asked her the same question. Why, Mama? Didn't I do good, Mama? You don't have to do as papa says anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What did I do wrong? Should I have made him suffer more?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And this is what she told me. "Look at you, you've become just like your papa."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Unbelievable, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What are you going to do with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What to do, what to do? I just wanted mama to love me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>From what I'd heard, mothers tend to be impressed by their children's creative endeavors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So I created all kinds of plays, and performed them just for her. I went without food and sleep so that the show could go on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I made a play about God saving the commonfolk. A play about an erroneous king. A play about a human who defeated a massive dragon. A play about a dragon who saved the day. I made dozens of plays, and every last one featured a happy ending.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I thought they would make mama happy, but, somehow, I could never get through to her. Why do you think that was?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Please. Just stop already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's it! That's exactly what she said to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>"Stop it." "You're boring me." "You're wasting my time." She'd scratch my face and tell me the same thing you did, time and time again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, she'd leap onto the stage and claw at me, interrupting me and forcing the show to grind to a halt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Mama! Mama, no! You have to watch till the end! There's a happy ending waiting for you! Please, Mama! Just keep watching!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'd beg her to let me continue, smiling all the while. Smile, smile, smile, smile, smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The day I managed to finish a play for the first time was the same day mama's heart stopped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Tragic, isn't it? I'd been planning to take her out to dinner! To celebrate the success of my first play!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But, in the end...that day never came.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Tell me about the first person you turned...inhuman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I didn't know anything back then, except that I could somehow grant people power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>One day, while wandering around Veda's lower floors, I encountered someone who was single-mindedly searching for power. He smiled widely as he approached me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>"God, please answer my prayers."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>He was smiling as he said that? That's rather...unsettling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I was delighted by his request. Naively so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Finally, I thought, here was something I could do. The idea filled me with a foolish sense of purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I didn't know what would happen, or how it would be done. Without any idea of what I was doing, I gave him the power he sought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>And, without even realizing I was doing it, I made him pay the price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>And so he lost his sense of self and became inhuman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What was it he sacrificed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hello. I'd like one dimensional power, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>At this point in my life, I only believe in the unbelievable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The facade of the stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You have no sacrifice to offer me, therefore I cannot provide you with a revelation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Oh, come on. Don't be so greedy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm not asking for me, but for this girl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>She has already sacrificed that which made her human. Her arms were taken and converted into the dimensional powers that now reside within Nihil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Nihil lost nothing in exchange, and therefore gained a power greater than anyone else ever has.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Is that not enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Humans just love hearing themselves talk. In pondering that, I finally came up with a play that I just know mama will love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Mama will get to see herself on the stage, because you who so resembles her will play the lead role. The stage will be set by Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>And the story will be about changing this terrible world, steeped in the sort of violence that my papa perpetrated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Am, you will play your part by fighting till you are in tatters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>This is to be a classic play where the underdog perseveres and makes a glorious comeback.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>If she were to lose something else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You have to use what you've got.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Even I cannot say what would become of that small body of hers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>It might hurt, but I will grit my teeth through the pain. No matter how wretched my existence becomes, I know I can endure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>But I can't fight on an empty stomach. I need power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>There is no need to be so impatient. Hasty decisions will only beget regrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Maybe so...but I'm fine with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Are you certain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I don't know how much longer I can keep going. But the harder I try, the further everything seems to slip away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I'm not capable of doing anything good. I'm at my limit, but there's only one place left in this world that will take me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Bravo! A round of applause for the lady of the hour!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I don't want to leave. I don't want to be left alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>You will never be able to atone for the sins you have committed. You are an ego-centric, deplorable seductress. You're barely human anyway. Little more than a puppet who can talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Is this truly what you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>She has no will of her own. She is a mindless slave! To her, servitude is bliss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>My arms have become nothing more than tools for fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>But if that's all they're good for, then so be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Power ungoverned by will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I only provide what people seek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I'm sure you understand better than anyone that such a choice is doomed to end in ruin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Perhaps. But maybe, just maybe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>You're still so naive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>If there is even one among those ten who can turn it all around... I want to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Offer me your sacrifice, and you will receive...a revelation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>This power... Could it be...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Goodbye for now, little glutton.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Has she been asleep the entire time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>You were the same way when you became Number Seven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I found her passed out in Veda. Her body was probably overwhelmed after receiving that sudden burst of power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Why do I get the feeling you're not telling us everything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Why would he give you the full story? It's a bad idea to tell a former thief where you keep your valuables.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Come on, we're all friends here! And you said it yourself: I'm not a thief anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Our combined abilities allow us to maintain her vitals, but there's a limit to what we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>The dimensional power has already eroded too much of her body. It's throwing off the delicate balance we've managed to achieve. She...might not have long left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Still, I can't help but be a little jealous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Why? She's lost her arms and her left eye. She can't even eat anymore. It's a miracle she's still alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>But she's so strong and pure, and she has a place where she belongs, with people who are happy to care for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Including our esteemed leader.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Sieba.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Hehe. Come to think of it, she would probably feel more at ease if a certain someone was to join her in bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Vier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Go on, Sol. Give her a cuddle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Quit ganging up on me, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I dunno. Sounds like a terrible idea to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>And why is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>You look like you've got cold hands and feet. Nothing worse than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Ohh, of course! Is that why you always wear gloves, Sol?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Haha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>There's that sarcastic laugh we know and love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>You're welcome. By the way, I do have one idea of something we can try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>To deal with my cold hands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>You know that wasn't what I was going to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>If the dimensional power is effectively poisoning her body, then maybe introducing another type of power into her will help balance things out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Another power? Like Alchemia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>We've used Alchemia for healing and recovery before, but using too much of it at once causes the body to reject it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>So, how do we do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Excuse me? It was your suggestion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>I'm just saying we should do whatever we can, even if the odds are slim.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>There's a chance the Alchemia won't have any effect at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Aha! The brains of the group joins us at last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Is that my title?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Well, you are the most studious person here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I suppose that's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>And, dang. Your hair sure is pretty. Even I can tell it has a beautiful silver sheen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Y-yes, well... Vier helped me take care of it earlier. I appreciate, the...um...compliment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Can we get back to talking about what's important here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>R-right. If we were to follow Sieba's proposal, I think we should create something like a vaccine. If we were able to introduce something that functioned like antibodies into her system, she might stand a chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>A vaccine, huh? If we can extract Alchemia from a source of dimensional power... Do you really think it could work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>We won't know unless we try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>And here's the muscle of the group! Gotta love that confidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Why don't we use the Phantom Soldiers that wander around Veda?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>That's a great idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>If we go about it properly, we could probably use Alchemy to create a lump of concentrated Alchemia imbued with dimensional power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Can we do that? Can we use Alchemia to balance out the dimensional power? To stabilize Amu's condition?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Only one way to find out. It's all or nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Hey. Why the long face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>The Phantom Soldiers in Veda are composed entirely of dimensional power. If we kill them, they'll just disappear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Then we'll just have to beat them to a pulp without killing them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Can you handle that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Granted, it's harder to catch someone than to kill them. You run the risk of leaving yourself open to counter-attacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>It'll be very different from just climbing the tower and killing everything in sight. Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Are you sure about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Ew! Don't pretend to care about us. It's weird.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>We're not fighting to climb Veda this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Amu's arms became your strength, didn't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>And you are our leader.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Which means that you're not really the one who's guiding us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>It's Amu. Amu's arms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Then I'd better do my all to get this done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>As we've already discussed, it's going to be hard to capture such a strong enemy alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>On top of that, it's going to take time to successfully transmute a Phantom Soldier. We're going to need the power and knowledge of Alchemy on our side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>It goes without saying, but I won't be able to do this alone. Especially not in a place like Veda, where enemies just keep coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>I'll require one commander to lead the charge. At least two people to attack and capture the enemy. And at least two more to provide backup and work on the alchemical components.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Well, the two of us are pretty good at handling a crisis. Aren't we, Zwei?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Us two?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Very well. Sieba and Zwei will be in charge of attacking and capturing Phantom Soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>I'll stay behind and watch over Amu and our hideout. Someone has to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Hehe... What about me? I'm much better at killing than fortune-telling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Yes, take her with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>All right, then. Füry and I will be bringing up the rear and performing the Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>That's four people in total. We're missing a commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>No, we're not. Our bodyguard is perfect for that role.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Bodyguard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Oh, yeah. That old guy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>I'll come along if you're climbing Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Ooh! Does that mean you're finally ready to join us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Sorry. No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Ooh, rejected again! You're really into older men, aren't you, Sieba?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Am not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>At any rate, you'll be taking the reins on this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>What's up, Sol?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>I just wanted to thank everyone for joining me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>I'm glad you're here with me.</td>
</tr>
