<td>So you're the person who made these sweets!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Owww... Yeah, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Be-because of you, children, who were looking forward to Halloween, are collapsing one after the other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(I never knew Mia could get so angry.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Collapsing? Children? Hmmm, I don't think that's supposed to happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Seriously! Are you gonna play dumb?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm telling the truth. I only handed them out to adults.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I mean, it's Halloween, right? I added the ingredient because I thought it would make for a more stimulating night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And...what were you gonna do if a child happened to eat one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Well...you know, I don't know. I only assumed adults were gonna eat them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>How can you be so irresponsible?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(Wow... Mia is pretty scary.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I don't think it's fair to call me irresponsible since I never fed them to children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So what do these sweets for adults taste like?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's bittersweet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Um, well...the base is brandy and bitter chocolate, and I added some Bewitching Flower as a secret ingredient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Bewitching Flower... Now why would you put something like that inside?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, you don't know about it? You should try it sometime. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What's so bad about a child getting a little under the influence? They're gonna go down that road eventually anyway. Why not get a taste of it now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You said you just passed it out to adults, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Sure. I'm not interested in children. See, the rest are still...h-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's gone, huh? I guess the children stole it while you were changing into your costume.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh... Does that sort of make this my fault?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Of course it does!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No way... Isn't it the children's fault for stealing it? It serves them right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's one thing for them to get a bellyache over regular sweets, but this isn't the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Exactly! You can't bring dangerous sweets into Halloween!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Okaaay, I get it. I feel bad that my mischief got a bit out of control. Let me help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Fine. You'll need to take responsibility. A child's life is no light matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Mmm... Huh? Where's the ghost? Is it gone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What ghost?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>People said there was this cool costume, but, when we all went to see it, it wasn't a person but an actual scary ghost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>A ghost? I wonder if it's another monster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Magnus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yeah, let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ghost? Monster? Sounds kinda fun. I'll go too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You focus on coming up with a cure for the children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Seriously?</td>
