<td>001</td>
<td>Phew... I think that's the last of them. Ugh, Rosa, you should have been more careful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>W-well, one cannot predict everything that might happen. Everybody is all right, I hope?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You bet! We're not scared of some monster costumes! We know it's all a show!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>A...show?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ahem! I mean, a show, of course! I am gladdened that this performance amused you, sweet children of the Rot und Schwarz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Before this unholiest of nights is done, I swear that I, the white-winged demoness, will have played the greatest trick of all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I fear that whatever surprise she has planned will far exceed the scope of 'pleasant.'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>However... "The greatest trick of all," she said. That gives me an interesting idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Allow me to explain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That might just work! It's bound to put a smile on Julia's face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, there is no time like the present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My friends, lend me your ears!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I wish to make this Halloween a celebration worthy of the Successor of the Sun! To this end, I propose a contest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>To the one among us responsible for the greatest 'pleasant surprise' of the night...I shall personally grant a boon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ramses?! Wh-where is this coming from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Where else but my royal whim? I desire only to spur this Halloween to greater heights of excitement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Is this really wise, Cheryl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Perhaps it's a little sudden, but as long as the contest remains between Phantom Soldiers, I don't see the harm in humoring him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I...suppose I must trust your judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Maybe there's no point in this if Julia's not even interested in it...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In that case, I will focus on patrolling so that the rest of you can enjoy yourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I will hear of no such thing! You of all people must be present!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Why is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Because you are the one whom these surprises are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I mean... Ahem. What I mean to say is, a contest is only a contest if all take part!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But someone has to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey, Ramses, are you sure about this? What if we're making things awkward for Julia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Nonsense! This contest shall bring joy and mirth to all, Julia included.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Our duties are important, of course, but surely even we Phantom Soldiers are permitted a little revelry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Only once this Halloween delights man and phantasm alike will it truly be worthy of the Successor of the Sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>For the sun's light falls equally upon all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yeah... Yeah, you're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And so, Julia, I fear I cannot take no for an answer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Very well. I will take part.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Splendid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Only, I'm a little uncertain what a "pleasant surprise" actually means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But that is obvious! It is... Erm... Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Actually, this is harder to explain than I had assumed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wouldn't it be way easier just to show her? C'mon, let's go find some surprises!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>To be honest, I'm a little unsure too. 'Pleasant surprises' aren't my area of expertise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Trick or treat! Give us candy or you'll get pranked!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Candy, is it? All right, here you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yaaaaay! *munch munch* Mmm, these are really good! What are they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hehe. Between you and me, they're actually made from vegetables!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Vegetables?! Ewww!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Whoa! I never eat my greens, but these are so good I couldn't tell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Now, wasn't that a surprise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I see... That was certainly different to the kind of surprise I am used to, but it has no less power to delight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I am glad to see the smiles on all of their faces. Although I will confess, I envy that child. Had I refused to eat my greens, I would have been deprived of dinner until I relented!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Gyaaah! Help! Someone, heeelp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Good grief! And after I went to so much trouble incorporating my collection into my tricks... How boorish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Excuse me, but what collection?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Why, my seasonal collection of torture devices, of course! Look, aren't they darling? Let me just... There!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Trick or torture! Trick or torture!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Delightful, isn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Absolutely not! That is positively terrifying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Waaaaah! Mama!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Wh-why are you running away?! Proud children of the Rot und Schwartz, come back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The world of 'pleasant surprises' is much more complex then I thought...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That's a bad example, okay? Don't let it give you any weird ideas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Anyway, it's my turn next! Tell me the first word that pops into your head!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Oh, and if that was "wolves," I'll take the second word instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What? Um, then... Will "Ratty" do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It'll do wonderfully! Now, just a snip-snip here, and a snip-snip there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>And tada! One Ratty, especially for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>My... It's adorable! I never knew paper could look so soft and furry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Oh, but that's not all! Try pulling on its nose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Like this? Oh, its tail moves! How delightful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I'm starting to see that pleasant surprises come in many shapes and sizes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>So what say you? Do you understand them better now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>It's hard to say. I think I might still be missing something important, but still, they are invigorating somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Perhaps the festival atmosphere is responsible. I never had much cause to attend such events in life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>If only I could share these joys with the one I served. They are rather wasted on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Say, Julia. Are you absolutely, totally sure there's nothing bothering you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>My Halloween carnival will not be complete until there is a smile on every face, yours included.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...You are both very kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>However, I fear that enjoying Halloween is simply beyond me, and that my presence will only worry you unnecessarily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>If I may, I would now like to return to my duties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Julia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>My apologies. I think I'll take a little walk to clear my head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Julia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I know those eyes only too well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>They are the eyes of someone who will not be dissuaded from their course, even by the Successor of the Sun himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Of someone whose emotions are sealed away behind a wall of firm resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>She smiles only to hide her sufferingâ€”but I will permit no such thing in my royal presence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Now I am more determined than ever to show her true joy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>That's more like it! Now we just need a plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Hey, you two are guards, right? There's a fight going on! You gotta stop it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Let us go, Blanchett! Duty calls!</td>
</tr>
