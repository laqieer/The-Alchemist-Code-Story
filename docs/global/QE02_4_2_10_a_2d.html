<td>How did you know I would be here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Well, if you stayed in the center of the clock tower, you would've missed out on seeing the conclusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I thought you would want to witness it all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I see. Quite a nice view, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>An old abandoned factory, huh? I agree. It's not a bad view.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm glad you like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm sure my father—who met his demise here—is glad as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Your father died here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes...he died protecting me when I was an infant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>My father, Jonathan, was an engineer at this factory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The weapons my father developed protect the country of Slothstein. When I was a child, I felt very proud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So this is Slothstein's weapons plant factory, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Weapon development is a crucial department that can affect a country's military status. Your father must have been quite talented.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes...too talented—enough to be noticed for his development skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Indeed. A talented weapons developer is something that every country wants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>How foolish. Every day, my father lived with the reality that the products he developed were used to take the lives of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Of course, no matter how tempting an offer...my father continued to turn them down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>In the end, the men who showed up resorted to forceful measures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Forceful measures?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Having grown frustrated with my father's lack of interest, they decided to abduct me. On a day that I had come to play in this factory, they suddenly appeared before me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Realizing that something was wrong, my father rushed to my side. There was a conflict between him and these men...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...And it ended in tragedy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ironically, the gun that took my father's life was one that he had developed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ever since...whenever anything happens, I remember my father's words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The mindset of the user can change even the most excellent products or useful machines into deadly weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Don't you understand? In the end, the roots of this world revert back to the ugly emotions of man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Everything is a result brought to fruition by man. Machines cannot sin! It is humans themselves that have corrupted this world with evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Let me ask you one question: are you Alvarez or the Messiah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It doesn't matter which I am. After all, you are about to be eradicated from this world.</td>
