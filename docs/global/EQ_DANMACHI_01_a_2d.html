<td>Bell Cranel. This is the Door of Truth. And I am Ouroboros, the observer of destiny.</td>

<td>That is of no consequence. All that matters is what you are to do here.</td>

<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Is that not how a hero's tale unfolds?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>
<td>A hero's...? Wait, hold on. Where even is this? I was in the middle of the dungeon until just a moment ago!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>And now you are not. Something has caused your world to become entangled with this one.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>I know not the circumstances of your world; only that two worlds which are supposed to be separate have become intertwined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>And when this occurred, a threat from your world drifted into ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>
<td>A...threat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>What you call monsters. One of them is here absorbing Alchemia, steadily growing in strength to become an even more powerful being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Its presence here damages the barrier between our two worlds, which could have a grave impact on both.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Thus have I summoned you here to extinguish this threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>
<td>So let me get this straight: a monster from the dungeon jumped into your world, and it's causing big trouble for the people here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>
<td>And that trouble could spread back to our world as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Excellent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>
<td>So, what are we waiting for? Let's go take down that threat together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>I am but an observer; I do not intervene.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>
<td>Wait. You're not going to help me fight? Come to think of it, this place does have a pretty ominous air to it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>
<td>Just what are you, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>That, too, is of no consequence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>But though I cannot join you, I have prepared guides who can—ones who are familiar with Wratharis, where the threat has appeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>In addition, I've summoned further help from your world as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Now, go forth, Bell Cranel! I look forward to what you will accomplish on your quest.</td>
