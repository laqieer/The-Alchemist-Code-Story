<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wh-where am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Bell Cranel. This is the Door of Truth. And I am Ouroboros, the observer of destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're the what, now? Wait... How do you know my name?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That is of no consequence. All that matters is what you are to do here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Is that not how a hero's tale unfolds?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>A hero's...? Wait, hold on. Where even is this? I was in the middle of the dungeon until just a moment ago!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>And now you are not. Something has caused your world to become entangled with this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So you're saying this is a completely different world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That is correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I guess I've been transported to the realm of the gods, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I know not the circumstances of your world; only that two worlds which are supposed to be separate have become intertwined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And when this occurred, a threat from your world drifted into ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A...threat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What you call monsters. One of them is here absorbing Alchemia, steadily growing in strength to become an even more powerful being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Its presence here damages the barrier between our two worlds, which could have a grave impact on both.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Thus have I summoned you here to extinguish this threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So let me get this straight: a monster from the dungeon jumped into your world, and it's causing big trouble for the people here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And that trouble could spread back to our world as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Got it. If you think I'm up to the task, then I'll gladly lend a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Excellent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So, what are we waiting for? Let's go take down that threat together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I am but an observer; I do not intervene.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wait. You're not going to help me fight? Come to think of it, this place does have a pretty ominous air to it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Just what are you, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That, too, is of no consequence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But though I cannot join you, I have prepared guides who can—ones who are familiar with Wratharis, where the threat has appeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>In addition, I've summoned further help from your world as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Now, go forth, Bell Cranel! I look forward to what you will accomplish on your quest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hold on! What do mean by further help from my world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Who else did you bring here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Is this really a whole other world? This...Wratharis, was it? What kind of land is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Aaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Whoa! Careful, there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Good; looks like you're unharmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hmph. Underwhelming, is more like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Who are you two?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We'll talk later. Right now, there are beasts to slay!</td>
