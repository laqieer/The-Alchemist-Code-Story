<td>Hehe. Then let me thank you again, on her behalf. And... was there something you wanted to ask me?</td>

<td><p_name></td>
<td>Well... I got a little worried when I saw you this morning. All alone, talking to a cat... And we transfer students have to stick together, you know? I was actually hoping we could be friends.</td>

<td><p_name></td>
<td>Although, to be honest, I think there was something else I wanted to talk to you about at the time... But whatever it is, it's gone now!</td>

<tr>
<td><p_name></td>
