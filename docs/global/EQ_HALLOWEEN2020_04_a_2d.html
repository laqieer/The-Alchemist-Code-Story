<td>002</td>
<td>A smile on every face, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(But how can I enjoy myself, knowing that same joy is denied to Lady Emmel?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(And all because I failed in my duty...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No, that's enough brooding. I have a job to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(It's that teddy bear again.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(It really does look a little like Lord Nimul...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Roll up, roll up! Fancy your hand at the ring toss, miss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hey, I remember you! You're that guard who was staring a hole in my teddy bear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I... I did not realize I was so fascinated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You sure were! Your friends almost bust a gut trying to win it for you, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>They... Blanchett and Ramses have been very kind to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hey, did you hear about that wonder potion? They say it works super fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yeah, I did! Do you think it's safe? I've seen a lot of people with it here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Can either of you explain how this fight came about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's this maniac's fault! First he comes at me with an axe, then he's got the nerve to tell me it was "just a prank"! I practically had a heart attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>C'mon, man, I was just trynna spook you! The best trick of the night gets a prize, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wait. Who told you that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ramses! Blanchett! We have a problem. Somehow, the townsfolk have found out about this contest of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I beg your pardon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Some of them have become a little...overenthusiastic, shall we say. We have kept them under control so far, but we can't hold out forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I don't get it. How did this happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, um... About that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We think Rosa's children mistook the contest for an official event... So they've been spreading the news to everybody they can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes, fine! It's all my fault, again! Why do you think I'm trying so hard to clean up this mess?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If anyone bears responsibility for this, it is me. This contest was my idea, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I thought it would be the perfect fit for the theme of "Pleasant Surprises."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yet it has become anything but pleasant! Truly, a blunder for the ages...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh, Ramses...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Let's not give up yet. We can sit around feeling sorry for ourselves, or we can try to fix this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...Indeed. Truer words were never spoken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Eeek!!! What's happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Whoa! The hell are you playing at?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I hear screams from over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yet another pleasant surprise taken too far, this time by you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Let me be very clear: a surprise is only 'pleasant' when everybody is sharing in the fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>This was NOT a pleasant surprise. This was self-centered meanness for your own gain, and I don't want to see it repeated. Am I understood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yes, ma'am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We're sorry, ma'am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I think that's the last mischief we'll be seeing from them. After that lecture, I'm sure they're feeling quite contrite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Imagine getting chewed out like that in public. I'd rather die...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...Self-centeredness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ramses, is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Not as such. Only... I am starting to question my own motivations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>At first I thought myself driven by a desire to make Julia smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But now I wonder whether I simply disliked having to witness her sadness. Perhaps all this was not for her benefit, but for mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Are you certain you aren't overthinking this? Surely you just wanted to do a good deed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>My gesture failed to resonate with Julia, and that in itself is the proof. Had I truly been sincere, she surely would have listened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Don't say that. When we heard you say you wanted to make her smile, we all knew you meant it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Why do you think I'm here, helping you? It's because I can tell you're the real deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>So stop moping and pick yourself up. The sun's got no business looking so glum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Try to shine a bit of light into someone's life. Isn't that what being the Successor of the Sun is all about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Or that's what I think, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Blanchett...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What's that you have there? Some kind of...red and black bottle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What, this? It's just a potion I got. Figured I could use it in a prank.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>A red and black potion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>How odd. I prepared those, but I haven't started handing those out... I meant to do that once the carnival was in full swing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I hope this isn't a repeat of last year's mischief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Of course not! They're simple glamour potions to help everyone get into the Halloween spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Glamour potions? What kind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>They merely give the drinker Ratty ears for a little while. Rather endearing, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Far better than that first batch I made, anyway. Drinking one of those would turn you into a Ratty from tip to toe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>A complete transformation?! I knew you couldn't be trusted with potions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I disposed of them safely, I promise! And I made sure everyone affected was given an antidote that turned them back into a human!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>There's an emergency! Someone's prank potions have ended up circulating around the town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It seems they transform people into monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You can't be serious...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Numaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Numumu? Numu?! Numyuaaa!</td>
</tr>
