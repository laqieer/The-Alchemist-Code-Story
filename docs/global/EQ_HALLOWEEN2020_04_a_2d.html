</tr>
<tr>

<td>Glamour potions? What kind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rosa.png" alt="Rosa" height="128"><br>Rosa</td>
<td>They merely give the drinker Ratty ears for a little while. Rather endearing, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rosa.png" alt="Rosa" height="128"><br>Rosa</td>
<td>Far better than that first batch I made, anyway. Drinking one of those would turn you into a Ratty from tip to toe.</td>
</tr>
