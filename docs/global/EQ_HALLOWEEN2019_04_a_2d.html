<td>Y-you...! But why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Were you not outraged earlier at the prospect of red-and-black jack-o'-lanterns?! This makes no sense...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What's that? You want me to translate for you again? Sure. Leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Numumu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Let's just say that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>By no means do we condone the changing of jack-o'-lanterns from orange to red. Such savagery is not to be tolerated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>However, we are of the opinion that in this instance we cannot protect the essence of Halloween without smashing a few pumpkins. Squeak, squeak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Numu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It said all of that with just a few squeaks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Heeheehee... Now, come! On this day the gates of Hades will open for us, so that we might paint this world in the most beautiful of hues!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hold it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So this is where you were! You've gotta come with me, quickly! A fight's broken out in town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>W-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmph. We have no choice. Leave these imps to me. The two of you had better hurry back to town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Understood. Thank you, Mei Fang. Melda, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Goodness...</td>

<td>(The children are falling to delinquency while those of age forget all restraint...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(How could the peaceful celebration of Halloween I had envisioned take a turn so quickly?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>After all, Halloween is full of surprises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Is this what he meant? Is this how Halloween is doomed to be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(No... I'm getting ahead of myself. We are still in the middle of our preparations.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(If I can regain order now, perhaps it won't be too late for the solemn standards of this occasion to be restored!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I brought 'em!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oi, you lot! Cut it out, will you? What're you fighting about, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>He keeps talking about dressing up as a werewolf, but that was my idea! I said it first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So what? What's wrong with both of us being werewolves, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Exactly! This is the silliest fight I've ever seen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hey, there's no garbage can around here. What am I supposed to do with this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Just throw it on the ground somewhere. Those girls on patrol will take care of later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yeah, you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>H-hold on just a moment, ladies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh? Hey, you! What do you think you're doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Cheryl, after him! He's a pickpocket!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Cheryl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You... All of you... You're all so...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Crime must be punished...and those who would be so insolent as to disrupt the austerity of this occasion, despite the fact that they are of an age where they ought to know better, will be punished by my hand!</td>
