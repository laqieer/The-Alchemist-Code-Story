<td>Well, well. I'm impressed by how fast you recovered. It seems I underestimated you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We'll see how long you can maintain that smug facade of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>For a knight in shining armor, you're pretty rude. Let me ask you this: have you reached the Door of Truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You...know about that place?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Heh. Your honesty is much appreciated.</td>

<td>I see. So you received that power of yours from her. No wonder you're so strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yet therein lies my chance to defeat you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I turned down her offer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't cling onto power like you. That difference in our mental strength should define which of us ultimately wins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You think that I cling onto power...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'll rely on my own power to win! Take that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I don't care how you perceive my actions. In order to fulfill my justice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'll do whatever I can to be victorious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There's a burden that I shoulder. I cannot afford to stop here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Agh! Agahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Edgar!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>How did you reach the Door of Truth? Do you know where the Sacred Stone is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ugh! Wh-what kind of nonsense are you spewing?! Aghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You're an outsider. I guess you just happened upon it by accident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's all I wanted to confirm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm finished with you. Don't bother me any further. Let's go, young lady...Alkemono.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Wa-wait! Edgar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Let Fiona go, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ugh! Wa-wait, you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Edgar! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This fight still isn't over yet! Get on the bike, Ronnie. We will pursue them!</td>
