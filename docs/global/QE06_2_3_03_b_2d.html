<td>002</td>
<td>What a lovely night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Relax. Call me Mitsuha. That's what Koga calls me. Is something troubling you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh...no it's nothing…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>There's no use pretending. It's written all over your face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…It's strange. I never thought the day would come when I could let my guard down around demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…I'm no longer a demon--now that I have no horns. But I can't really call myself human either…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…I don't know--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You don't know where you belong, huh? That's quite a human feeling to have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If you regret it, why did you remove your horns in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I don't know... Impulse, maybe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>…Hahahaha! That also sounds very human!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I don't regret it though. I wanted to do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But now I have even more questions... Who or what am I…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>…You are who you are. Humans and demons are more than labels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>When I saw you break off your horns, I thought, "Maybe peace deserves a chance." It's a difficult thing for me to articulate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But…Maybe that's it… I feel like Koga taught me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>…I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So, try not to overthink it... I suppose you just need more time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm worried about my brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>At first, I wanted to live so that my brother wouldn't have to carry such a heavy burden… That was my hope, anyway…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But I may have only added to his burden… I'd never thought about it until now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Koga is the same way. He's a man with lofty ideals and a penchant for steamrolling others… However, I'm fond of him nonetheless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The fact that his ideals are born out of lived experience, moves me all the more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You thought the same, right? Otherwise you wouldn't be here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>…Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Then do not hesitate. Lift your head up high, and press onward… I’m sure Koga would say the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>*Chuckle* Who would've thought I'd be having this conversation with a demon… The universe works in mysterious ways!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Is this your horn--Why are you giving me this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I want to entrust it to you, in case anything ever happens… I'm sure it will be of some use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...You don't mean--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>…I hope that day never comes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>…Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…The stars are so pretty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>They are. We look to them to illuminate our path… After all, the stars are the spirits of our ancestors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Spirits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yes…spirits of those who fulfilled their purpose on this earth...and those who didn't--they are the stars that shine upon us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Life--it's all connected. Koga said so…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Only the future knows whether your decision is right or wrong. All you can do now is move forward with conviction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Isn't that right? It doesn't matter who or what you are. The glittering stars will still shine upon you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>At the very least, Koga chose you. That should be enough to satisfy you, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>…Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Then quit dawdling and hurry up and go to him… It's pointless to keep worrying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>This is just the beginning of your noble cause… You can count on me every step of the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The Wadatsumi of tomorrow, the one Koga has set forth, will be a place of happiness. It is my duty to protect that future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>…Mitsuha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>…Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>…Twinkling stars, please light the way--for me…and for Koga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I hope…these days will last forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…Tamba</td>
