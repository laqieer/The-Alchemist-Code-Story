<td>There's an entire underground area! Look how big it is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>They must've built it here to avoid that eruption from before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You've got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Everybody moved underground to avoid the fire and corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But what's with this lack of security?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Shouldn't there be, like, guards shouting at us? "Identify yourselves, scoundrels!" or something. You know what I mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It may be because of Imnus's diversion. Or, at least I'd like to hope so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes. Let's hope that's all there is to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Which way to the castle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This place is totally different from the mining facilities in the Acedia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Probably because people actually live here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But you can see that it's started crumbling here and there. Are they just neglecting the upkeep?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's also awfully quiet for a city. You'd expect at least a little bit of hustle and bustle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No, this is very unusual... Where is everyone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This is one of the few places where people can still survive in the Ira Belt, so why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It may be suspect, but it's also the best chance we have to venture deep into the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>However... Trap or not, it's definitely unusual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Maybe they encountered something unexpected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...Mt. Shinai burned them all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Were you following us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>A few days ago, Mr. Shinai started spewing vast quantities of corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The knights who stood guard were the first to die. Then the retired knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Soon, even the women and children also had to pick up a sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>And they couldn't handle it because most of the troops were busy with the invasion of Invidia. That really backfired on them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But why is this happening? Didn't Quence say that he was in control of Satna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why would he allow it to harm the citizens of the Ira Belt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Maybe his control isn't as good as he implied. Perhaps that's why he needed Libra?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That, or these sacrifices were part of his plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...If that's the case, we should contact the queen. Teres, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We might be able to negotiate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Then you should hurry. There's nothing left to see in this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So the castle is completely deserted, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...Here it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>So you've come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's an honor, Queen of the Ira Belt. Allow me to introduce myself—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I know who you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You are the ones who aided the Invidia Belt in vanquishing my troops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The ones that Quence called the Pursuers of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We have some unresolved business with this Quence. I understand that the two of you are working together. Is that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That's right. The two of us conspired to invade the Invidia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>So, what business do you have with me? Have you come to cut my head off in retaliation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We did not come to fight. We'd rather talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I firmly believe that we can save this region if we work together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>King Patricius of the Invidia Belt has already sworn to cooperate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>He will provide territory and all the living necessities for the refugees from the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>So, please. What do you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...I see. You are much like my brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Someone that believes in the good of humans, that virtue will be rewarded, and the delusion that everyone can live happily ever after.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Those are lovely little dreams for peacetime. But I fear we are at war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I fear that cooperation means little when your head could be on the chopping block the next day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'm not someone who carries that much faith in others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>When humans are driven into a corner, dignity and pride are the first things that are thrown away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Of course there are some that stick to their principles right up till the very end or the sentimental fools that will continue to try and help others despite everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>But they are not in the majority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Mixing those of different cultures and backgrounds will inevitably lead to conflict, which will once more lead to destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The strongest are the only ones to rise from those ashes. Those left behind are those capable of ruling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>They are the only ones worthy of surviving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...And that's us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I don't get it. There must've been a way for you to carry on the king's aspirations after he fell to the corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>So why didn't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>There's no point to all this banter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Quence. I got you your private audience with the pursuers. Just like you asked for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You take care of the rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Of course, Queen Terese.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hello, pursuers. I've been waiting for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Quence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Give Libra back, jerk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I'm terribly sorry, but that won't be possible. Besides—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Once my plan is completed, you will no longer have need for such a weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What is that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Oops, little slip of the tongue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Please, forgive me. My grand plan is so close to coming to fruition. I suppose my lips have gotten a little loose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Oh no! Nimul! Look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Get away from him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Corrupted flames? But how? This quantity would—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>GROOOOAAAAAH!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Loathsome living. Accursed humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>This world has long since fallen. Creation has forgotten its providence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL I WILL—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>—make you perish, burn it all to the ground! All those within these purifying flames will be rendered little more than ashes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Huh? Those flames took on a shape—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>That there is Satna. The mortal enemy of all those living in the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>(It can't be.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>(I saw it. Back when it was fighting Leviathan at the border. This is not the same Cursed Beast.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>(Is this truly Satna? Then what was the beast that I saw—?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>This is Satna? It's different from the Cursed Beasts we've encountered so far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Isn't this just a being made of flames?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Well, I can't really speak for the other Cursed Beasts. I don't know many after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>The only other one I witnessed for half a sec was the one in the Invidia Belt—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>And I gotta admit, that Leviathan was pretty different from what we're dealing with here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>But this is definitely Satna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>This is what me and the other knights have been fighting this entire time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Fighting while never knowing when our next compatriot will succumb to its corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>It stinks... It stinks... This stench of the living... That which fuels my wrath—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Uhm, guys? I think it noticed us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>If that is truly a Cursed Beast, then Mesarthim's divine protection will stop its attacks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I will protect you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I'll help, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Whatever that form is supposed to be, it's basically just a writhing mass of corruption! That means my Spiritbonding should be effective here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Thanks! Here it comes!</td>
</tr>
