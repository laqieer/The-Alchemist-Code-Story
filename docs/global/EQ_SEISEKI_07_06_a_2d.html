<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Hmph. I have no recollection of having invited you here. How about you show yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Um...are you talking about me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Who else would I be talking to...Captain Othima of the 6th Regiment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Seriously? Were you a dog in your previous life? How did you smell me out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You managed to evade the strict guard of Greed Dike and penetrate this castle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Honestly, I'm impressed by your abilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Not really. I wanted to go about things in a clever manner, but the Special Forces ended up finding me. They really meant business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Are you telling me that you fought against the Special Forces, the most elite armed forces in all of Babel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Did I go a little too far? Sorry. You seem frozen in place.<br><br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It...appears that I underestimated you slightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>More importantly...what is an elder of the Holy Order sneaking around here for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If those of the Council were to find out, I wonder what their reaction would be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You seem to be making dangerous assumptions. Just to be clear, I am here to observe. There's nothing suspicious about my actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh come on...save the excuses. I've heard plenty enough already from Seida and Monzein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hmph. Aren't you the one that's in a more compromising position?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're a captain in the Holy Guard who has infiltrated Greed Dike without permission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Furthermore, if you were to have engaged in battle with Greed Dike soldiers, it would be quite the problem.<br><br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Are you saying that it'll become a foreign affair? Seriously...you gotta be kidding me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You lot are the ones who abetted Captain Kudanstein, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You really pulled one off, didn't you? Now that the Lord Commander is dead, it's a little too late to be talking about foreign affairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well, that's not a very polite thing to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What are you talking about? I'd prefer you if you didn't start making outlandish accusations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Th-the Lion Monarch...Orion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Emperor Orion...what are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Heheh. I would be hard-pressed not to formally greet the wise and famous Captain Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, I'll be... So you know about me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Of course. However, I'm very sorry, but we're quite busy at the moment. Unless you have a pressing matter, I would like to ask that you step aside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No...I still haven't addressed why I'm here. I came here to declare war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Declare war...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Regardless of appearances, I am actually pretty worked up right now. After all, Commander Zain saved my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That being said, it doesn't sit very well with me if you lot get ahead of yourselves and start plotting something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What do you want to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>This isn't really my type of thing, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Try crossing the line again...I'll kill you. Understood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Y-you, scum!!! How dare you speak to Emperor Orion like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oops. Best if you don't move. After all, I could light your emperor on fire right now if I wanted to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>As a fellow magic-user, you know what I'm talking about, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Tsk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What are you plotting now? It would be in your best interest to spit it out now. Trust me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hyahahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Agh?! Wh-what's this?! Pitch-black...magic?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You think you're going to kill me? Do you actually think an incompetent bunch like you are capable of killing me...? Hyahahah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Uck! I-it's strangling me! N-not good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You're quite the entertaining fellow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That being said, your overly-entertaining ideas can lead to unforeseen...and perhaps even dangerous results, Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...Understood.<br><br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Phantom soldiers? Is this the power of darkness? I see...you've transmuted them from intense dark powers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It's time I ask you to take your leave. Attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ack! Moonlit Night!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huff...huff...! Ah, that was dangerous! They almost had me there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Quite the impressive schemer. It looks like you'll be more trouble than I anticipated. Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I haven't survived this war-torn world without a little scheming of my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Wh-wha...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Scatter, in the name of the Immortal Rose!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Ca-Captain Yauras...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Honestly. Why are you causing a commotion like this? It's not very proper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Whoa! You're amazing! And your timing's impeccable! I was in a real tough spot there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Seriously. Try to at least be a little apologetic. Isn't there something you should say after going off and acting on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huh? ...I love you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>So you're Captain Yauras of the 1st Regiment. I am honored to meet you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I heard that you were seriously wounded by Captain Kudanstein. Has your wound healed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I profusely apologize for Othima's incredible act of rudeness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hey! Captain Yauras?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Owww!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Control yourself! You're in front of the emperor! Hurry up and kneel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Uck...! Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You live up to your prestigious reputation, Captain Yauras. Very well-mannered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>That being said, Captain Yauras...does your presence mean that you are here for the same reason as Othima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>No. Please do not misunderstand my intentions. Othima is just a little confused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>We are here to greet you, Bishop Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yes. Currently, the Lord Commander Kanon is making her way to repair the Holy Sword Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>This is the first step towards reviving the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I thought it would best to visit you first, Bishop Waginau, as you were close to the former Lord Commander Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Heheh. She's got one over you, Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Very well. Your business is done here. Take Waginau with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hey...Captain Yauras!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Know your strength. There's not a single chance that we would win in this current situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>But...we still haven't grasped the whereabouts of Captain Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Hmph. In tribute to your valor, let me tell you one thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ye-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You're looking for Kudanstein...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Apparently, he's headed to the land where Excalibur might be repaired, though I don't know how useful this information will be to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Kudan...is headed to where Kanon and the others are?!</td>
</tr>
