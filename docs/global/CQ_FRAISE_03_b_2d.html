<td>We did it! Victor...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Be careful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>An ambush...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? Now we're completely surrounded...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ack. I'm sorry. This is all my fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Victor, I'll create an escape route for you! Run and report what's happened here to the king!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What are you talking about?! Look at how many of them there are! You'll die in the meantime!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Don't worry about me! Please...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I won't go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I told you I'm not going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Just because this is your first mission, stop trying to shoulder everything on your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We're in this together! You've got to trust and rely on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>("A knight must protect and believe in his country, his people, and his comrades"...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's right. I got so caught up in this mission that I forgot to trust my own comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Seriously. You've always been a little air-headed. I can't tell whether you're dependable or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Besides, you're the commander now. How stupid are you to go charging in on your own...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You gotta leave that kind stuff to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh? What're you laughing about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No...I just find you really dependable right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's such a reassuring thing to know that someone has my back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's a little late for that. Oh, in that case, maybe that will reassure you even more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Aghhh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Captain! We've come to assist you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Soldiers...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You just went off on your own when we got word of the enemy attack, so I went and told everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'll admit...today you've all taught me a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Thanks for the compliment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Agh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Are the two of you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes! Victor! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Already on it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...We somehow managed to finish them off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I wouldn't have been able to do it without you. Thank you so much. And...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm sorry. My inexperience put you in danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Please...enough of that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I...just did the obvious things that a knight is supposed to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Well...I learned a lot from your example. And I realized that I've still got so much I need to learn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Victor, I have a request I'd like to make of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>A request...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Please, be my friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What?! What's gotten into you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You helped me realize something important! I need a friend like you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I want to become friends with you! So...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No! I told you, didn't I? I feel uncomfortable around you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Why?! What's wrong with me? Please, tell me, Victor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>No, Vicky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Why are you suddenly calling me by my nickname?! Argh...fine! If you want to know that badly, I'll tell you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You're such a hard worker and you're amazing! You can do anything, but you're also super humble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You work hard and you don't brag! When you show me that side of you, I lose confidence in myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Also, you're tall! But you're not stuck-up. And you're easy-going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hmm. I see the problem. My height, huh? I can't make myself shorter...so maybe I should brag more?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Look at me, Vicky! I'm amazing, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Jeez! Seriously! I can't even hate the way you brag! Argh! I'm getting so annoyed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Come on. Let's go back! You've got a report to deliver and stuff, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Wa-wait, Vicky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...I feel like I've only managed to make matters worse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Sigh... I'm so bad at these things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That being said, as long as we stick together...we can become stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yes...I've still got a lot of room to grow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>And...and...one day...!</td>
</tr>
