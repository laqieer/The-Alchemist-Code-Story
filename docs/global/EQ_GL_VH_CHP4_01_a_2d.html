<td>We were able to make it out in one piece.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Goetia's presence had suddenly thinned out in the past twelve hours over some commotion in the main district...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...Affording us the time to slip by undetected past the borders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Soren, Eira, Siegfried, and myself... We fled Slothstein like fugitives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>- Slothstein-Lustberg Borders -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>All clear for the road ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Your teacher chose an interesting location for her home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Teach never was one for the stiffs in the capital...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Plus, all this open space clears her head, she says. That, and something about being left in peace to wander the numerous ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There. Should be just over that hill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Lead on...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...Getting...colder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yeah. We're getting closer to Lustberg, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Lust...berg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh, right. I guess you didn't pass through Lustberg when you left Tröstendorf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's due east from the village, Eira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ooh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm glad she looks a little better. Slothstein really took its toll on her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The more distance we can put between Goetia and us, the better. Let's keep moving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That was around three days ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We found the Professor's residence without difficulty, but we weren't prepared for her guest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Siegfried!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Teach... It's so good to see you. You won't believe—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wait. A guest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>*sniff* *gasp*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Emmyyyy!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Eira... You're safe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What... How...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Come in, my dears. We have a lot to catch up on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And here we are now. It seems that Emrys ran into the Professor outside Roxanne's manor, who had come on a social visit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>With everyone in one place, we can finally begin planning our next move...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Writing in your journal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Keeping a record could help prepare us for future scenarios.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Is everyone here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yeah. Eira's sleeping too, so let's begin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Allow me to recap for everyone's benefit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>A strange organization calling themselves Goetia appears to be in search of information related to Atropos, including its now-defunct Core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>They have gone to great lengths to harass Lord Zheng Yi and his house, and now turn their sights upon Soren and Eira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Once captured, they attempted to collect your Alchemia signatures...but for what, we do not know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Soren, you mentioned you had a vision of someone calling out to you—Lachesis, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes. I couldn't see much of anything, but I heard a young female voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I'm not sure what she meant by me "creating" her... Didn't I create Constructs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I don't think any of the Constructs we've encountered were human...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What about Shion's report on Goetia, Blair?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I was in the study poring over it when the attack happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The most I could glean from it was how Goetia employs "living weapons"—the likes of that girl in red and the one with the overcharged bow, I'm sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>There was nothing pertaining to Constructs explicitly, though it did mention an elevated interest in the terminated Atropos project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It seems we will have to rely on academia for further elucidation, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>But before that, we have one last concern—that of the Elylon Teg. Emrys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>So it is true. You're connected to our clan somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I suppose you really are a man of mystery, Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But if it will help shed light on Eira's condition, I will tell you all I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>We of the Elylon Teg have resided in the northernmost reaches of Lustberg for generations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Eira and I are what few remain of our people...and had she not manifested her overwhelming powers, we may have never left our home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Do you mean... Eira's Alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yes. Though Alchemia particles exist in all creatures, a rare few of our own produce far too much for their bodies to safely handle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...'Tis a slow and painful fate for the afflicted. It is said they die in agony, and it is why we call it a curse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>So you came in search of a cure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I had Eira committed to a facility where she could receive experimental treatment in the meantime...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...Only to find it destroyed one day, and my sister missing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>My leads took me to Slothstein, in search of the one they call "the Broker".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You could have met Roxanne, huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Would that this had turned out differently. Instead, I found myself before Goetia's doors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>My search for the truth continues. I worry for Eira every day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>The one I worked with—the one who calls herself the Queen—I know now that she is responsible for the attack on my sister's facility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Dreadful. What destruction the dogged pursuit of knowledge has wrought...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>And I would do anything to stop another incident like Atropos. Where do we start?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Well, my extensive collection of tomes could shed some light on the Elylon Teg—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Uhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...But I think you'd be much happier in the field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Can I trouble you to take a look in my study, Emrys? Don't mind the mess too terribly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>It would be my pleasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Count me in for the texts. There's probably quite a lot to go through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Then I'll keep a lookout near the borders. You can't be too careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I don't want to have to say this, Siegfried, but...don't go off on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Then that's settled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>While it's not possible to return to Slothstein, given Atropos, Lachesis may not be within the country at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>And if my hypothesis is correct about your intermittent visions, then perhaps the frozen plains may evoke memories of the Elylon Teg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Sounds good. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
