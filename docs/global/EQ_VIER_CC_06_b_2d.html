<td>002</td>
<td>Where did your pet kitten come from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Kha...! Hrhrmmm! Ha... Whoo...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No pet of mine. She's got her own will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't get in my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sol told me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You don't think your life has any value. That's your will, though. You do have a will of your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>In that caseâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well, we have a will, too. We're looking forward to something! I'm waiting for something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>And? How do you think that makes you different from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Nng... S-stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You child! What do you know?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There's something you need to do before you can die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If you're willing to try to force us to fulfill your will, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You have to tell us what it is, or you'll never be fulfilled!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There's...nothing...to say...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ah...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I've been waiting for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What? For me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I don't know you, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I've been waiting for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hold on...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Because I just happened to show up at a convenient moment? Just so you could comfortably sleep beside someone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>How...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...cold of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>C-cold...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Always so polite...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Haaaa...haaaaa...haaaa... Nnng...! Nnnff...haaa...haaaa....</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Zwei!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So polite... So very... I've been waiting, and you've all been waiting for me, and I... I still...have...nothing to teach you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I-I'm so very t-t-tired... She... I...just...wanted...to s-sleep in comfort.... Together...with you. That's...all I've ever wanted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That was all! Such a small thing! So why...? Why...?! Why must I...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We call them dreams because they'll never become reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I won't push you to go on living. I don't believe there's any value to life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>There are no words I could say to someone like you who has lived so much more than I have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>A dried-up flower... Withered petals...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The seeds fall from them, burying themselves in the earth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It's not so bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Still.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Everyone has their own issues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Nothing stays pure. The longer you live, the more it changes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>If you keep using the same old rag, it gets dirty and you can't wash it clean anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's just that I can't help but like the idea of seeing that and knowing that I've done everything I could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Maybe it's not clean and pure anymore, but it doesn't mean it was meaningless. That's a worthy kind of corruption, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Can't you at least hang around until you tire of me? That's not such a bad proposition, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That one...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>She doesn't have long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>She won't survive until your dream is realized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...Yes. And when she tires, she'll need a gentle hand to help her recover.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Besides, she needs more family. A home full of men is stifling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>N-no, that's not true... It's fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Of course I'd love for you to do some real work with us, but...I hoped you might be willing to care for and teach her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What was that saying? "Everyone has a right to education"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But you lot plan to turn the world on its head, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But we have to live in it until then. It's better to know more about it, all the better to fulfill our dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Just...until I tire of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Haha. This is where you sleep from now on. Not bad, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Well, Vier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Mhmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I just...can't sleep anymore.</td>
