<td>I see. Suspicious humans in the forest...</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>That's right! We have Yura to thank that there were no injuries. She was patrolling there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Please, if you hadn't come when you did, I would be dead... I can't do anything myself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But if you hadn't been there, some of the villagers may have been injured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Not to mention, a therian could have been kidnapped. It's thanks to you that nothing happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>There's been a number of reports of therians being taken from Envylia's forests. I'm in the middle of investigating these disappearances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The woman in the village was saying something about that too... You knew about this, captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes. We're still investigating, but... It's possible that there's a group trafficking people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Therians are often targets of such things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It is our duty to protect all citizens of Envylia. We've been carrying out our investigation in secret so as to avoid drawing unwanted attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I volunteered to help. As a special forces unit, a member of the Scarlet Flame Guard doesn't draw suspicion if they're traveling all over the place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>When I heard that therians were being targeted, I couldn't just sit around and do nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I...see...</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(Missions really are different when you get to Vice-Captain...)</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(She really is amazing... She can do all that by herself.)</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>To think they'd appear in the forest this close to the capital... It seems the situation has become worse than we thought. Commander Yura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Y-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This is an order. I'd like you to cooperate with Scarlet Flame Guard Vice-Captain D'Artagnan here and look into the situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>M-me?! I don't know how much help a little platoon commander like me will be to a Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't talk like that! We're buddies, aren't we? We joined at the same time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Th-that's true, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Many of the therians who have come to Envylia came because they were targeted for being therian. I'm sure you're aware of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Because of this, many therians are increasingly unwilling to trust humans. That's why I'd like the two of you on this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Commander Yura, this is a perfect chance to prove your talents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Captain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I understand. I'll do my best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Good. Good luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hooray! You always were the best at tracking in our class! This'll be easy with you aboard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I don't know about that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We've had reports of our targets using incantation gear that suppresses the power of therians. Be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Will do! Let's protect everyone together, Yura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Y-yeah...</td>
