<td>That woman... It can't be! Is that...the Thunder Wolf, Langhao?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The Thunder Wolf? The most likely candidate to succeed the empire, whose power only the winner of this very tournament can hope to match?! Why would she be here now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So, you're Langhao. They say you're the most powerful of the potential successors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You dare speak my name? That is a privilege allowed only to those who are worthy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(Ngh. She's strength incarnate! I can't drop my guard for even a moment.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You...are just as I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wh-what's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It means you're boring me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?! Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Apply a little pain and it starts, is that it? You've been stealing his life force all this while, but when your host is at death's door, you give a just a drop of it back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You want to keep using him, don't you? Not even a single drop of his blood is allowed to spill by another's hand. You really are greedy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You seem to prefer hiding in the shadows of others, but do you truly wish to keep your relationship with Mammon in the shadows as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>There are many successors in attendance, you know. Why don't you tell them, here and now, what little secret you've got hiding within you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>S-stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If they find out, another assassin will be sent. Another person will suffer because of me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I don't want to respond to those who have been kind to me by killing them! Not anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So you choose to endure it alone? Fancy yourself a tragic hero? You really are insufferable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If you don't want them finding out, then you'll have to stop me. And I won't go down easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>C-curses! Rraaaaaaghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ahaha! You should have fought like this from the start!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Haaa...haaaa... No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Why are they fighting like this? This is just a tournament! Are they trying to kill each other?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>One of them will probably pass out soon from the blood loss. Please just let this end...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see. Now I understand. This won't be enough, will it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Fine, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>In honor of your steadfast fighting and bravery, I'll let you go. But just for today.</td>
