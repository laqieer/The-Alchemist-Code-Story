<td>We will not let outsiders in! That's the law of our village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The law...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The law?! Who cares about that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If you don't hurry up, your village will perish! It's a curable disease! Hurry, take me to the sick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I cannot! Even if the village were to perish, we must protect our law.</td>

<td>Ack... There's no talking sense into him. Sen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Y-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>How many people are suffering from the disease?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>About...14 or 15.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I see. Arkil, give me back the medicine that I gave you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sure. Is it enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>For now. However, the disease may return if it's only taken once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We must hurry and gather the ingredients. We'll use what ingredients we have—as for the rest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Sen, do the flowers called Snowbells grow here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Snowbells grow on that mountain over there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Got it! Well then, first of all, we must quickly get this medicine to the sick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Are you gonna get it? The...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Snowbells. They grow on exceptionally high mountains. Of course, I'll go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's pointless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's not pointless. I'll tell you once again. This sickness is curable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmph... The mountain is dangerous... There is a monster... He rules the mountain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You won't return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm well aware that it's dangerous. But I can't abandon these lives that can be saved!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>He-hey! Hold up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Arkil, why do you follow me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What do you mean "why"? Wouldn't it be better if both of us searched for it rather than you going on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Kshhhaaaaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You know if you were to die, we wouldn't be able to save the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You're right. Still...I can't afford to die here!</td>
