<td>It'll be somewhat dangerous, but we'll take a shortcut that'll get us there the quickest. Stay quiet, all right?</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>Of course. More importantly, Sabareta, what are those idiotic ideals of yours?</td>
</tr>

<td>You just told me you remembered idiotic ideals from your past. Come on, tell me. We're in this together, right?</td>

<td>I would often think to myself, "Why do people have to hurt each other?"</td>

<td>I dreamed of a world where people got along without resorting to force.</td>

<td>Thinking back on it now, those were lofty, idiotic ideals.</td>

<td>They weren't idiotic.</td>

<td>013</td>
<td>What...?</td>

<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What's idiotic about them?! Agatha, Dias, and I all share those same ideals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If people who shared the same ideals came together, it wouldn't be a pipe dream any longer, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's exactly why I said they were idiotic. They're just ideals...</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Then...it's just a matter of turning those ideals into reality!</td>

<td>That being said, it may sometimes serve as a beaconâ€”a beacon bright enough to extinguish the darkness.</td>

<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We must do everything we can to catch up with Zeke and stop your brother's advancing army.</td>
