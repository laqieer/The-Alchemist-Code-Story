<td>The reason I love gardenias isn't because their beauty is fleeting…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's because they're flowers of mourning, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I love them simply because of their beauty and fragrance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>One day, I hope I can tell someone gardenias are not for mourning.</td>

<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>They mean so much more to me than that.</td>

<td>The red flower I adorn myself with--the poppy--has many meanings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I wanted to choose my words carefully before I spoke in order to do it justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>If so, just spit it out already. What does the little poppy have to say?</td>

<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I am Lamia, knight of Wratharis. If you think you can put me in the ground--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>If you think you can extinguish my divine fire, you are gravely mistaken!</td>
