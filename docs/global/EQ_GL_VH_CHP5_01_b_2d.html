<td>Soren, Eira - quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ready, Eira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Mhm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Haaaah...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The cryotube begins to flare with a blinding light as the gentle humming grows louder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Grasping threads seeped forth from the crack in its chassis as if caught in a breeze.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Like the blooming of a flower, the cocoon spun of purest light began to unravel—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>How peculiar! The Alchemia level has abruptly returned to baseline for this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Mmh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What a long nap...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's been so long... Finally, we meet again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Feels like so much has changed, but Master will always be Master, I think!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh! And you must be Eira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hello...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ehe. It's so good to see the Elylon Teg keeping well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ah! I almost forgot. Where are we, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>An energetic one, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I gather you're to thank for normalizing the Alchemia here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh! Did I do something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Quite the contrary. Now, can I suggest my humble abode for a better conversation spot?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wow, there's so many people here. Do you all live together? Are you family?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>These are my friends, Lachesis. I owe much of who I am today to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hmm... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm happy Master has made friends. Otherwise it's just us and the Constructs and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Would you tell us about the Constructs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Soren's visions are at best confusing to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yeah... I mean, I created you...right? What was I like before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Who am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ahh... Okay, I think I get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Where do I start? It's kind of weird explaining your own work to you, Master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But I guess you did lose a lot of your memory, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You made the three of us. We, who are called the Sisters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Atropos was the first, followed by me...and finally, Clotho.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We weren't the only ones, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Master made many. Constructs, they were called, in all shapes and sizes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Each an improvement on the last to make the world a better place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Isn't that wonderful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But it failed in the end. Atropos's Core was flawed, and Zheng Yi was overwhelmed by it. And now, Goetia wants in on that power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Maybe peace will always be a naive dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But what matters is that Master's intentions were pure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Sister Atropos was the means, and Sister Clotho the guiding hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What about you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Master believed in the goodness of the soul...and so do I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Then, the Elylon Teg...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We stayed behind to help them for a time, remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Eira's condition—the one they call a curse—is what we had wanted to treat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>So that no child would have to suffer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You...wanted to treat the curse of our clan along with Soren?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>How? There were no records of you as far as I know-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>On the other side of the room, Red begins to stir from her dazed slumber.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Where...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>About time. You're safe for now, but not exactly among friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Berith...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>With a shaky hand, Red feels around for her greatsword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Let her.</td>
