<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Your Highness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm fine. Being on horseback just got to my wounds. It's not a problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>How are the soldiers doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Seeing you here has uplifted their spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>They should be able to go through with the plan without issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I see. Then all we have to do is rendezvous with Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Adelbert, would you lend me an ear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Of course, your Highness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I...feel so pathetic. Look, my hands are shaking in fear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is your first real battle, your Highness. It's only natural to be nervous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's not it, Adelbert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The battle that will decide the fate of this country is before me, and yet all I can think about is Marie's wellbeing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Every soldier here is risking their life for the sake of this country...but I... I'm ashamed of how abject I can be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You are mistaken, your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>To be able to woe for someone you love, that is a highly admirable, human quality. No one would criticize you for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Do you think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Absolutely. That is why we all are here. We are fighting for the ones we love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So be proud, your Highness. We are honored to follow you under these motives and intentions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Thank you, Adelbert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Uh, sorry to interrupt your little moment here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>How long were you listening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The whole time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Forget what you heard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I-I thought it was beautiful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Caring is important, isn't it? Isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Heh. Hahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Y-your Highness?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hahaha, my apologies, but that helped me relax a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So, you were about to take another route, were you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We are, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Kamui wishes to use the fact that the enemy can track my movements to our advantage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Are you sure you'll be okay with just the two of you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I can still scatter beasts away. We're not going that far anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Well then, we'll be off. Take care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Agatha? What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, I'm just a little nervous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ah, yeah, you had amnesia, right? If you're worried, I could handle the negotiations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's not that. I'm just not sure what I should talk about. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I see. It probably would be wise to think of some topic of conversation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>There's gotta be something you can say that will drag Dias Elysion, the Captain of the Fourth Regiment of the Holy Guard, out onto the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Your face, your hair... All of it is maddening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It baffles me how Seriolde could fall for such a girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Your loathing of the Sephira truly knows no bounds, Ceclidis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Of course. They were the biggest obstruction on my path to rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I will see every lost drop of their blood go up in smoke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hmph, did I anger you? Come to think of it, you share the same bloodline as the Sephira. Does it pain you to hear such malevolence toward your people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>A woman from Saga has contacted the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Alchemy is a great threat to us, the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>If the Holy Guard is to stand against us, we will need to split a large portion of our forces to deal with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Could they be...? No! That's impossible! Waginau and the Protector oppose each other. There is no way they would stand together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>But what if...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Eradicate them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Are you sure? You will be losing a significant portion of your forces in battle against the Liberation Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That is of little consequence to me! Kill them! Devour and wreak havoc upon all who have ties with that man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ceclidis... He was a perfect candidate to be our vessel, but his will is at its limit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>It is fortunate that we found a new vessel. The resurrection ceremony is soon at hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>O cradle reborn, Cryphone! Blessed be, your evil majesty!</td>
