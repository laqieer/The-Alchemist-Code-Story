<td>Do you think so?</td>

<tr>

<td>Oh, I'm just a little nervous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ah, yeah, you had amnesia, right? If you're worried, I could handle the negotiations.</td>
</tr>

<td>It's not that. I'm just not sure what I should talk about. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/moca.png" alt="Mocca" height="128"><br>Mocca</td>
