<td>Ngh! I'd better retreat for now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Dangit! He got away! Mei Fang! Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Of course I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Good! I'm sorry that I let him slip away...but I guess all that matters is that you're unharmed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hmph. Vivi, wait here until my war council is finished. I want your company.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh?! I have a job to do, too, you know! Well, I guess it's all right. I can't say no to a friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We should go for a swim or something! I'll wait for you at the beach!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Okay, I have lots to prepare before Mei Fang comes back! I want to make the most of this, since we don't get to spend much time together. It's good to let loose once in a while!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>First, I need to chill the fruit that I bought in town in some water. Then, I need to find a nice, safe place to set up the hammock!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Once I've taken care of that, all that's left is clearing out the sea cucumbers! Ready...set...go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>All right, looking good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Okay, now for a quick check of the surrounding area, just to make sure there are no more assassins... All clear! Now I'll set up a few traps, just to be safe, and...done! Mission complete!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ah, Mei Fang! Over here! I found a nice spot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmm. This is rather nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Right? Let's relax in the hammock! I've already eliminated any possible dangers, so you can just let go and relax to the max! Come on, hop in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Very well, I will sit with you. Hmm... This is quite cozy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Told you! I brought us some fruit, too! I'll try it first, just to make sure it isn't poisoned. Ugmf, delicious! You have to try some!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Mmm! It's nice and cool. How refreshing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hahahahaha, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wait... Did you hear that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Maybe it's a monster? I'll go check it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't let your guard down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh, you got caught in my trap! Sorry about that! I'll let you out. Hey, don't struggle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Vivi! There are more monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What?! Why are there so many?! Just leave us alone, you creeps!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Tch. Such terrible manners. Allow me to teach you a lesson!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Phew, thanks Mei Fang! You saved my butt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hmph. Things are certainly never dull when I am with you, Vivi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ahahahahah! I wonder who could have set up these traps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's dangerous to just leave them lying around. I'd better go collect them, and then we can go home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>All right, only one more to go... I think!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Vivi, be quiet for a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>H-huh? Ah! Th-that's the guy who tried to attack you earlier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>How fortuitous. Let us have him fall into one of your traps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Got it. I'll go around him. The last trap is right over there. You know what to do, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Tch. To whom do you think you are speaking? Be sure that you make no missteps!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes, ma'am! All right, here I go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(This is it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You, there! Looking for something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Nngh?!Â Dangit! Stay still!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Take that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
