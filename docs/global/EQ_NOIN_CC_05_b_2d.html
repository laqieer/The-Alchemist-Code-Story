<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Their sacrifices were what kept me alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I was born as a monster. Traces of scales on my vermillion skin, fangs, and a golden mane...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I don't know the details, but they called it a mutation, or ancestral reversion, or simply called me a demon child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I ate through my mother's womb, killed my enraged father, and survived being thrown off a cliff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They were worshiping me in some shrine deep in the mountains by the time I was self aware. They fed me sacrifices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sacrifices...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>In Wadatsumi, they believe demons and humans formed a truce between themselves long ago. It is said their blood gradually combined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So, every now and then, a demon child is born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Humans always ostracize those who look different, whether they be demons or beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>They kept feeding me sacrifices in this commune full of such people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Devour one human life, and you take another step away from humanity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's what was taught there. The more I ate those sacrifices, the more I felt my conscience getting chipped away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Those bastards must have been planning on forging me into a true demon and exacting revenge on the rest of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Heheh. Bet you can tell I never made any friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well, I don't think you really had a chance to make any... So yeah, I don't think you have any friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Even then, I had one friend I got to play with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>A therian slave that got both his eyes gouged out and his fangs pulled by the all-mighty humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>He never feared me because he never knew what I looked like. He liked me, and that didn't feel bad at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I used to slip out of the shrine to meet him down by the village at the base of the mountain. We built a secret hideout together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I was such a hopeless little demon back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The next full moon, the sacrifice presented was that therian kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That kid was a helpless one, too. He never knew that the monster on the altar was me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>He smiled and prayed to me, "O' great demon lord, take my flesh and bring retribution upon the humans."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Devour one therian life, and you take a beastly leap away from humanity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The eyes of the cultists that curried my favor, the scarred eye-lids of that helpless kid, and his shivering lips...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I really was such a hopeless little demon back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I wouldn't judge you if you ran away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I beat them all to death. The bastards that worshipped me, and the apathetic villagers. All of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You, what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I told myself I wasn't wrong for doing so, but I knew it wasn't right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's when I swore to follow the rules I set for myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I've always been scared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I like you, Dead Nine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You're creeping me out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You say power is everything, but you're not willing to throw everything else away, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Nng!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(He's strong!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I love the way you are now. Rational, with your own set of rules to restrain yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You don't know anything about me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I do know I need your strength, but I don't know how to get you to work for me. What should I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You're a philosopher, aren't ya? Think on it yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What's the matter? Don't tell me the other dimension's power was all talk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Haha! I'm just not used to it yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Show me what you got!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Nnrk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>M-my powers won't coalesce? What theâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(Is this the discomfort I felt while in Veda?! But it's on a totally different scale!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Look at you. Can't even control your own power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's right. That's why I need some sort of commandment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Commandment...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Something that can bind powers together. Something that can hold a body that's coming apart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>A strong commandment that can discipline my weak self!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Aghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Urgh... Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>This is a terrible fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hm...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Rat-Killer?! Where have you been?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'm not "Rat-Killer" anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'm now a member of the Veda Templars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Call me Zwei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Lost Blue is a place where outlaws deceive and get deceived for the sake of their own ambitions and greed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>We'll need true solidarity to climb Veda. You already know betrayal will only bring more betrayals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Yeah. Ain't that the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Dead Nine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>If I am to reach the top, I will need a powerful commandment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'll need to keep things simple. Ten members in the group should be enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>We'll take on dirty jobs while we train. We'll take the Sacred Stones for ourselves to turn this world on its head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>We'll engrave and carry commandments on our backs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>We'll be the Veda Templars!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I will lead them, and I will bring the sky to this world. I will drag the weak-willed, apathetic scum into the light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>My name... Is Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Sol?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I will be the Sun that Lost Blue needs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I can't afford to be nihilistic anymore.</td>
</tr>
