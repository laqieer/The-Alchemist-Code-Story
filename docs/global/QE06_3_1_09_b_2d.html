</tr>
<tr>

<td>It can't be! You turned yourself into a Dismortant?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>For my research. The closest test subject I had was myself, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Judius</td>
<td>You're not the only one with cards yet to be shown. To lead the Dismortants, one must be strong! So to that end...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I created a medicine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>But now that I've shown you this form, it's over. Any infinitesimal chance you may have had is well and truly quashed. You will die here.</td>
