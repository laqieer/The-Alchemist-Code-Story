<td>001</td>
<td>I want you to be our second member. Then, with him, you can—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I am now Zwei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I will not give up until the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But still, I'm the second one to join?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yeah, you're the second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're zero... I'm the second...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I see. So you're much like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There's someone you're waiting for, isn't there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah, someone who went on ahead without me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>My first ever friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmph... Well done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I kept it open for you. The first seat of the Templars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Eins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I guess that number's all that I'll be leaving behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Why did you not stop me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I did not understand. These people must be important to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yet you tolerated this tyrannical invasion which could have taken their homes from them. Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>A-are you fed up with me? Are you f-fed up with one who knows so little?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Maybe I wanted you to know them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If a dragon were to destroy the world, there would be nothing left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's not something a dragon should be doing. The unseen hand of the divine ought to side with humans. That is more interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Because life is finite and fragile, they strive for power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Because their will is to topple this world—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Eins and I are connected to this Mystic Tower Veda. We cannot die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Now that Eins has become a vanguard of the tower along with me, even if he were to fall, he will someday walk within this tower again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>He will appear somewhere in its heights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Though none can know when that will be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Are you jealous that I don't have to worry about my life span?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Who knows?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This just means I get to catch up to you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I was always the one waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This is the first time I have ever had someone to care enough to reach me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>And now this is the first time I shall play the role of one who sends you all out into the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You will, from now on, be sending out all who live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You cannot become the one and only for anybody. You will forever watch those you care for leave you behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It is not so bad, though. I am yet still number one for some: for Nero and for you, the Templars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Will you laugh at me, saying my efforts were wasted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I had no idea you could be as cool as you are now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You too, Nero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I am...too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Eins blazed the path, while you gave us the strength to march upon it, Nero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Thank you for speaking to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I... Uh... But you've all lost so much, and only gained power... And yet, still...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We'll gain a whole world to live in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That sounds...exciting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm counting on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The common understanding upon the battlefield...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>The vanguard is always defeated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Otherwise you hinder those that follow behind you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I keep losing, but that's expected. It's my charge to keep on going. They may knock me down, but I keep getting up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Go get your blue sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Oh, hey, you're alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I got so bored playing their games!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Just to let you know, I did not lose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I take it you lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>She must have lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Get out! Get out of my space! This is not some rest area for souls or some park you can hang out at!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Remember this, Nero: that's what we call a 'sore loser'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I see. Pitiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Get yourself back to Veda!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Come visit sometime, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>That was a good way to kill some time, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Th-that...! W-well... I did get to see the power of human will. I can eventually visit you at some point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>We'll be waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I guess I'm naive myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I've gained some delightful knowledge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>There is always some form of reprisal if you let an evildoer go free.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Just as the hunter will come for the beast, the commandments will come forth to reform the world wherever vengeance is called for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ah... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>The footsteps you leave that carry you up to your doom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>The path taken from a dark past to a dark future...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>That is life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Cool, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Hehe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>We should let them live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>This is our quest to vanquish dragons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>If we make it above, there will be those who rule and block the sky, and they will be waiting for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I'm so disheartened. It's so preposterous, I can't see it happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>As long as I live and my goal remains true, I will not lower my blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ugh, so predictable...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>This blade has been forged to endure. It is reliable indeed. It will not shatter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Heheh, right. Well, at least until we close our eyes and do not open them again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Until we have our wish in hand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>We will not stop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Perhaps that is why we call them dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>There is only one dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>To bring the fake justice to ground, and a future full of possibilities to our family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You're so dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>That is precisely why we need our light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I'll dazzle you all if you want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Because even the fake can become authentic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Right. Until we overturn this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I can't walk the streets with my chin held high!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Let's all make it outside first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Let's go take down those obsessed with claiming justice or peace for themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Right, boss? It's up to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I promise I won't get in your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>You have never, Acht.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Even if all of my weapons are shattered...I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Your efforts will not be in vain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Y-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>We will have that sky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>You're...staring off into the distance again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Ah... Sorry, sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>But...you found us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Sol... You shone light upon us, who didn't exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>If we are to topple the world, I believe we need to separate, spread across the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>That will be necessary if we are to control the whole board.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Even if we do, don't forget.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>We will fight on our own accord!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>We will fight and die where we choose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>But still, we are with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I hear footsteps behind me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Ah... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>It was the answer I could not find.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I suppose I could carry so much with me because of the emptiness inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>It's my duty to look like I know what I'm doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Make it seem like I foresee events and indomitably stand my ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Still, my eyes are always following others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>So, I wanted them to be with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I wanted those selfish, egotistical, maniacal friends of mine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Those friends I can see surpassing me, and I can entrust the future to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Leave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Even though I'm still empty, even though I still am not worthy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>I show off and march on, holding a place for my comrades to belong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Sometimes I check the soles of my shoes, just to check.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>In the darkness of the underground, even if I can't see the path behind me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>The wear and tear on my shoes is proof of how far we've come together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>We run further and my shoes wear down even more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>How exciting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>We know what we must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>We've gained power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>We will never stop.</td>
</tr>
