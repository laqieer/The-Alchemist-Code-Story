<td>So, I have to know. Do samurais actually commit seppuku?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Sep...puku?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's a Wadatsumi custom; a form of ritual suicide. I believe it's also called harakiri. It's where you pierce your own stomach with a katana.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Eurgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Gross! Why the heck would anyone do something like that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's a form of penitence. A way to demonstrate one's willingness to atone for one's crimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Y-you mean people do it willingly?! No way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's an incredibly painful way to go. A slow, torturous death—unless someone grants you the mercy of a beheading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Why don't they just get someone to behead them in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>And why does it have to be the stomach?! I mean, yikes! Ow! I'd take a beheading any day of the week—I mean, if I had to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sometimes the leader or commander of an organization commits the act, sacrificing themself to protect the honor of their family and subordinates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I see... "Take me instead," huh? That's certainly a very final way to get the message across.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Unthinkable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Death achieves nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>In this life, we don't have time to regret, or reflect on our mistakes. We best pay tribute to those who have fallen by moving ever forwards in their name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The path of life takes many forms. For some of us it's a straight line, faithfully followed from beginning to end, with all side paths ignored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>For others it is a maze of indecisions and mistakes, with many forks in the road, much backtracking, and not a little wandering astray.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We may stumble, but only by standing up again and pressing on can we guarantee that we will someday reach the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>True enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Welcome to the Shadow Messiah. Vagrant, murderer, bodyguard... Whatever you may be, you may make yourself at home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Thank you for the meal, and for allowing me to stay the night. I am in your debt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Think nothing of it. It serves my interests as well as yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This lot have been starving for company, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh?! No we haven't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's so quiet here without Silma...and Spica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>W-well, maybe she has, but not me! I don't get lonely or nothin'!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>From time to time, even I find myself missing how these halls used to ring with laughter...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's been a while since I've been able to give my wife a decent meal and a good night's rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That you continue to fight, even after all you've been through—even after the death of your daughter, and the ruin of your wife's mind...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I must admit, I am impressed. You are clearly strong of will and determined in your purpose, unafraid to fight alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You know, I daresay we have something in common. We, too, seek to reset the world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And remove from it those who would harm our family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We will achieve a new order, under which those we love will be provided for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You...have a family?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Her heart lives on within me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Eternally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Maybe Yogi had a point...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You're goin' to have a hard time fightin' off her attackers with her on your back like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I will proceed alone from this point on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>No way! I’m a member of Shadow Messiah! I should always be with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I...I swore to Corvus that I would!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>If you truly are a member of Shadow Messiah...then you are one with me, and you will inherit my will, Shadow Messiah Ila.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Protect Mia from harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yeah, okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You are the ones who will inherit my will. You will carry my beliefs along the passage of time. Do I make myself clear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Y-yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Zehn, I leave them in your care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Perhaps that was his version of committing seppuku.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The Shadow Messiah was on the verge of collapse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Maybe, by leaving it behind, he hoped to bury his past self...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I suppose this is why people seek companionship, or a place to call their own. We all need a receptacle in which to deposit our burdens when they grow too heavy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Who do I turn to now, Mitsu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Y-you're not going to kill yourself, are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Believe me, I would if I could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But I can't leave her behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>S-so, what? You're just going to carry her around with you? Forever?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Besides...the only thing that deserves a place around my neck is this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What's...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>This scarf was their birthday present to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I'm going to hold on to it, no matter how much it hurts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>(And I will hold on to this, no matter how much it hurts!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>A zebra could never hope to best a lion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Obviously. I am well aware of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Then why don't you give up? Your pitiful resistance is only delaying the inevitable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hmph. You don't understand, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>There was once one who put the lion in his place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>In one fell swoop, he managed to delay the invasion of Wadatsumi, force the abolishment of Imperial Security, and rob you of a valuable pawn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Not only that, but I've heard tell that when Greed Dike's hostilities suddenly stopped, some fled Wadatsumi, allowing them to escape the chaos to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Make no mistake, the man you thought so little of changed the fate of a nation right under your nose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>However minute an effect that might have had on history, it cannot be denied that he left a scratch right across your snout, lion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What are you trying to say, whelp? What part of this do you claim I fail to understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You still don't get it? Well, then, allow me to enlighten you: He proved that you can be harmed by the weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Hmph. If you're quite done spouting nonsense, I'm ready to finish this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Come, now. What's the hurry? You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Hah. You're amusing, I'll give you that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>In that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You ought to remember me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>But just in case...I'll give you something to remember me by!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Fool... You cannot touch me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Satisfied?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Thanks for clearing the room.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>So kind of you to grant him the opportunity for his little battle to take place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I merely showed him the respect a warrior deserves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>What are you going to do about that fellow he mentioned... D. Lily, was it? Will you have a different agent of the Elite Guard take care of him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>D. Lily?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>We are still searching for him, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>My survival of the fittest policy remains intact. Nothing has changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I expected as much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>At least...not within the beliefs I hold as ruler of this nation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I find myself wondering... What was the point of scrapping Imperial Security to create the Elite Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Was it not because you wanted an organization to guard you more closely?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Hmph. That was rhetorical; I wasn't asking you. Anyway, to return to our previous subject... Who's this D. Lily you mentioned?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>What? Surely you jest! Was he not the traitor who tried to kill you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Did that happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>It's not ringing any bells. Whoever they were, I've clean forgotten them.</td>
</tr>
