<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It appears that Captain Othima has headed towards Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Captain Yauras and Captain Seida are already heading there as well. Saga may very well become the setting for this crucial battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>More importantly, there's one more thing I must warn you about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Captain Othima told me this was the utmost priority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The utmost priority...? What is it?</td>

<td>012</td>
<td>There is a possibility that the Lion Monarch Orion is a Vessel of Reincarnation.</td>

<td>A Vessel of...Reincarnation?</td>

<td>It appears the people around here belong to a battle tribe. There seems to be a considerable difference according to each faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Unfortunately...your esteemed fighting power doesn't work on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>After all, when it comes to brute force, I am well acquainted with one of the most powerful fighters in all of the continent.</td>

<td>Oh, dear. Once again, because of your stubbornness, countless lives have vanished in an instance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Y-you...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That Tehre...he was smart. In order to protect his tribe, he submitted and gave me his Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Sh-shut up! W-we will not waver in the face of danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We of the Fuu faction only look ahead to the future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If I were to give you the Matter, Saga's future would...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...How should I best convey this to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>How many times do I have to tell you? Are you finally going to follow his wise example?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Agh... This is...for the sake of protecting my people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>That was a handful, but now I've got two of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Prepare yourself! May our god rain fury down on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>A god...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Is this god...stronger than me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Come on...let's go, redhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Fuu! Are you going to let him go?!</td>

<td>Destruction of the Matter is our final option. We must avoid it until we have no other choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>That wind warrior...she told us there was a way to prevent the worst possible outcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Are you talking about Captain Seida of the Holy Guard's 3rd Regiment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Yes... Let's believe her words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>When the worst possible outcome befalls us...we will destroy it with our hands.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I know I'll receive a scolding for saying this, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>In our current predicament...we have no one to rely on but Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Asena will come to protect Saga. I'm sure of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>The Godwolf Asena. Until then...please, protect Beelzebub a little longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...I will leave now.</td>
