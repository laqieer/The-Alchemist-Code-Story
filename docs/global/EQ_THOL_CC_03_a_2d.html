<td>That's just a load of hypocrisy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>There is honor in it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Self-righteous bull!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The world isn't easy to change. Violence and pillaging only breeds more of the same and it eats away at this world without end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And you say you represent absolute justice?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The only absolute is that what you lot are doing is wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You needlessly spread tragedy, rendering our efforts to establish peace futile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Futile...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Then I, too, was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Let me tell you about what it means to take on a job that you know you won't return from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm talking about a job with high risk and negligible returns. A job for the most pitiful of pitiful: those whose lives are most valuable in the act of throwing it away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Dragon hunting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A dirty job reserved for those seen as expendable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Assassination is one of those jobs brought to Lost Blue in secret from Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The people of Lost Blue who live in the shadows are perfect for it: they are untraceable and expendable assets for Greed Dike to exploit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>A wretched business that could be likened to climbing aboard a ship made of mud doomed to sink. And yet for those of us already drowning in Lost Blue, it was all we had.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The target... The Flame Dragon King Cadanova, the Guardian of the Land?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>A job in which we take lives without ever being told why. That is what we have been reduced to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Nobody's willing to take this job anymore. I am prepared to make the pay worth your while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What do you mean by "anymore"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Exactly what I said. I'm very disappointed. The hardy, infamous villains of Lost Blue are all acting cagey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>They're all declining this job, making excuses about not being able to kill the guy who defeated Vanir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>They think he's a real dragon or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>They've been reading too many fairy tales.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Dragons aren't real.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Quit acting all high and mighty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ex Atmosphere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Argh! He's too strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Have you any sense of honor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>When has honor ever put food on the table?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Those without honor have no right to hold power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I-I don't wanna die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Aghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Is there not even a shred of honor in you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What the hell is honor supposed to be anyways?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Have you no honorable will?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>My whole life I've been trying to run from the pointless, tired waste that is all I have ever known, but what waited for me at the end of the tunnel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Dammit! Tell me, who do you think would've taught me about something like honor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Life on the verge of burning away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Someone who lives their life alone will die alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>And without ever accomplishing anything. That was the life I was going to leave behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What the hell was I supposed to do instead?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What the hell was the point of any of it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Why did I even bother to...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>At least you weren't a complete waste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Vanir...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'm honored that you remembered me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It would have been wiser of you to just disappear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Now, absolute justice... I told you, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>There's always some sort of reprisal if you let an evildoer go free.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What did you do? Your Alchemia has changed... You seem incomparably more powerful than before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Does it please you? You ought to compliment me on the results of my considerable efforts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>In such a short period of time... How?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I've been diligently climbing a particular tower, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I suppose I can't afford to let you go again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Take a good look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>That is what the world considers to be the image of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hear the lamentation of my soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Phantom Karmacoma—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>There it is, that's what got me last time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It's...a dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It's really a dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Isn't that just unfair?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I've been forced to fight alone. This raging fire of righteousness incinerates all: powerful enough to dry the tears of dragons, it also poses a danger to my comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Hear these tearless lamentations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Oh, get over yourself, you hypocrite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>The things that the greater nations do always end up getting copied by others. It has always been like that throughout history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>This is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Phantom Karmacoma!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>A...unicorn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What incredible talent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Talent? No. This is a result of hard work, thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>How ridiculous. No matter how hard I work to accomplish things, people just assume it's the product of pure talent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I never expected it to be possible for my dragon to be imitated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>A friend of mine who knew nothing of the sky built this mount with me with the sole purpose of allowing me to charge ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I will hear you weep, Flame Dragon King.</td>
