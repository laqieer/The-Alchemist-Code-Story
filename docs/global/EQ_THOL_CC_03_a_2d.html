<td>The people of Lost Blue who live in the shadows are perfect for it: they are untraceable and expendable assets for Greed Dike to exploit.</td>

<td>A wretched business that could be likened to climbing aboard a ship made of mud doomed to sink. And yet for those of us already drowning in Lost Blue, it was all we had.</td>
