<td>What is this? What happened here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>To have brought such a large force, Greed Dike must be serious about taking Northern Pride down today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Even so, how can Northern Pride be so overwhelmed?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Our homeland is defended by the elite among the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Our forces should be able to match Greed Dike's army, no matter their number!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Would you like to know why your situation is so dire?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Get back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Northern Pride wasn't the one that hired us, that's the difference! Gwahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're one of Sol's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Who is this guy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>He's one of the Templars, a mercenary hired by Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Templars?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey, samurai. It's impressive you can parry my attack, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>He's gone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Agh! Ughh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Reimei!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ha, idiot. If you hadn't awkwardly tried to dodge, you could have died without writhing in pain like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Urgh, he's...so fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>So, you're Kagura, right? I've been looking for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>For me? Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I haven't done anything worthwhile in this fight yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I can't let Sol have all the fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Fun...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I need to kill at least one captain to satisfy my bloodlust!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I don't care which one, but...you seem to be the only one left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'll get to be the one with the last major kill!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Wh-what?! This isn't a game!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm not playing around! Aren't you the one who ruined the Matter for us? That was supposed to be our payment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We were gonna seek you out and kill you no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'd like to see you try!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>R-run...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>H-he's on...a whole other level... He'll...k-kill you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Your warning comes a little too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Your death will make a nice souvenir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wh-wha—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Tch! He's caught up already?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Captain Kagura! Are you all right?! Who is this guy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Basheeny! This is Reimei. He kept me safe while I was travelling from the Desert Zone to come here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Uh...okay. Anyway, you should go on ahead. I have fought this man before and I know how to handle him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Leave him to me, and head to the castle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The castle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Orion was seen marching in alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The Sacred Stone Lucifer and the Emperor are in danger! Please hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You brat! Get back here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Flying Gear Assault!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Gnh! You?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You're gonna have to go through me first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Captain Kagura! Before you go, I have to know one thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I've heard that Captain Othima and Seida have...passed away. Is this true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You should hurry! Reimei, was it? Please look after Captain Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Tch! There's no turning back now! We've gotta go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Basheeny! You'd better survive this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>As if I'd let you escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Grnh?! Why you little...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>We meet again... This won't be like the last time we fought. I've found the key to defeating you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You may be imperceptibly fast, but I can still catch the moment you take action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I'm counting on you, Captain Kagura! Huzzaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Sh-she's...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>She's too strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Tell me. Has Captain Kagura of the 5th Regiment not yet returned?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Captain Kagura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>What do you want with her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>She is the one who destroyed what we were owed... The Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Ha! So Captain Kagura was able to prevent you from plundering the Matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Perhaps this is amusing to you, but this is no laughing matter for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Obtaining the Matter was Sol's primary objective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>We were at the brink of accomplishing that objective, and Kagura took it away from us. I will never forgive her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>This Sol... He is dear to you, isn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>He is. When I was orphaned by war, I had lost all purpose in life. Sol was the one who gave me hope for the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Sol is my sunshine. He is the reason I live. I'm sure you wouldn't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I do understand. Wanting to dedicate yourself to the person that gave you meaning in life? That is a feeling I truly understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You are the first person to say so. I am...pleased... However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I cannot waste any time here. You will now die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Uh-oh! Here she comes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>That's a cold weapon you've got there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>There's no way such a heartless weapon can beat mine! I made this weapon with my blood and soul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Miuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>As a weaponsmith, it's my duty to make you understand that weapons are made to protect people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Finally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>How many years has it been since I began this quest? How many have I slain along the way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Hmph. None of that matters now that I stand here on this ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Halt, Orion, you degenerate usurper! You are surrounded! Give yourself up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>The Leviathan of Envylia, the Matter of Saga, and the Mikaboshi of Wadatsumi have each been disabled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Mammon of Greed Dike is mine, and now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Now Lucifer of Northern Pride is within my grasp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Surely the balance of power in this world cannot be any more destabilized than it is at this point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Tch! Did you not hear me?! Lay down your weapon or else—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Wh-what is that thing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Aaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Nameless warriors, there is no need to lament. Your sacrifices will be the foundation of a new world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>The time has come! A new era is now upon us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>O ancient tower of desires, show yourself to this world once more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Th-the Sacred Stones are...glowing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Look there! Is that...the Tower of Babel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Hahaha! I knew you were anticipating this moment as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Now, make your path to resurrection apparent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Founder of Alchemy, Nimul... Descend unto my being!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Nnrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Lord Commander Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Wh-where is Orion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>My apologies! We could not stand against his overwhelming power as he made his way toward the Babel Ruins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Ngh...! N-no! We must s-stop him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Lord Commander! Medic, over here! Hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Never mind me! Get to the more seriously wounded first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>K-Kagura?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Are you okay?! Where is Orion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>He took Lucifer and headed to the Babel Ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>He took Lucifer?! What about the Emperor?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Medics are caring for him now. His wounds are deep, but they're not life-threatening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Then...all is not yet lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>The Lion Monarch Orion... His aim is to topple this world from its foundations!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Conflicts within this continent mean nothing to him. He doesn't even blink at killing the leader of this suzerain nation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>You are...Chihaya's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Hey, it's been a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>You two...know each other?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>We met once before, in Wadatsumi. It was before I started working with Kudanstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>You were with Captain Kudan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>For a while after Wadatsumi, yeah. By the way...I heard Kudanstein has returned to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Did you have anything to do with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>H-how do you know about that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>I'm the one asking questions here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>As far as I know, that's just hearsay. There has been no chance for me to confirm that rumor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>It's the truth. I was saved by him just recently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>By Captain Kudan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Kanon... Have you heard about Captain Othima and Seida?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>I have. That they...passed away. Is it true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>I'm...sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Captain Othima and Seida were both trying to save me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>They gave their lives to... to...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>There's no need to cry, Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>They are both alive within your heart, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>The fact you survived and made it this far is proof enough that their will lives on within you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>No matter how hard things get, we have to keep our eyes on the future. For their sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>I was about to be killed along with Captain Othima and Seida, but that's when Kudan came and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>If Kudan had not arrived when he did, I would surely be dead now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...? But why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>I don't know why he saved me. He even said he had no obligation to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>He really can't be honest with himself, can he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Anyway, this is no time to discuss this. We can talk later! Kagura, come with me to the Babel Ruins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Orion has the Sacred Stone Lucifer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>He plans to awaken the Tower of Babel, that which paves the path for Nimul's resurrection!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>We must hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>And...? What are you going to do? Destroy the Sacred Stones?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>That voice...came from that guy all in black over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Who is he? Do you know him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>It's...S-Sol!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Urgh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>I thought you said you were getting used to my speed. Don't make me laugh! I'm here to kill someone ranked Captain or higher! You're not worth my time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>I'm not worth your time? I'll prove you wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Urgh! Why, you little...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>If I couldn't learn from the past, I wouldn't be able to face Captain Othima again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>I can't disappoint him—bless his soul—by losing to the likes of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>You...actually managed to...wound me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>He's gone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>You really shouldn't have done that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>He's faster than before?! Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>I'll shred you to pieces, brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Hey, hey, hey! It's not like you to get beaten so badly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Little frog?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Stop calling me a frog!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Hmph! You think another kid in the fight is gonna change anything? Fools!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Behind me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Wh-whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Some of us aren't kids anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Urgh! Another one?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>We are the Scarlet Flame Guard of Envylia! We will now join the battle in support of the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Soldiers of Greed Dike, prepare yourselves!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Captain Vettel! Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>We finally managed to subdue the Greed Dike forces in Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>I apologize for the delay. We came as soon as we could to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Th-thank you so much! This is definitely the boost we needed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>There's no need to thank us. Had Captain Monzein not been there to help us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Our country would be in complete ruin by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>It's only right that we would come to help during Northern Pride's time of need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>Paladins of the Holy Guard, hear me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Knights of Lustburg and Gluttony Foss are on their way, along with even more soldiers of a few other countries!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Do not lose hope! We can and will drive back Greed Dike's forces! Hold fast, and victory will be ours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>This must be what Commander Kanon and Captain Monzein were talking about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>Little frog, I finally understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>This is what they meant when they said that caring for others is what gives us strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Heh, nice. You finally get it. Also, stop calling me a frog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Aaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>How long do you all intend to stand around and chat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>You really think the lot of you can defeat us? You, who have known nothing but lives of comfort and ease?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>He's preparing to attack! Everybody watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>You've all ticked me off! I'm going to kill—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>Wh-what the...? What is he looking at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>Tch! Took you long enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>I'll kill you later. Just you wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>He...ran away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>Captain Vettel, I'm going after him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>Right! We'll cover you! Knights, raise your swords! This is the battle that will decide the fate of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>We just received reports that the Scarlet Flame Guard have arrived from Envylia to support us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>Not only that, but knights from other countries are on their way as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>Looks like the wind's blowing in our favor. What are you going to do? Keep this up and you'll...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>Um, are you listening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>The fair wind is still on our side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240</td>
<td>It is settled. We have won. All of you should surrender for your own good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>241</td>
<td>What?! What are you talking about? We just said knights from around the world are headed this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>242</td>
<td>There's no way you can win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>243</td>
<td>It's not about numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>244</td>
<td>The fate of this world was sealed the moment he arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>245</td>
<td>Who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>246</td>
<td>No... You can't mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>247</td>
<td>A new future is about to be created. Take pride in knowing you will bear witness to the birth of a new era.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>248</td>
<td>She's gone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>249</td>
<td>Miuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>250</td>
<td>I know! Let's go after her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>251</td>
<td>Hey, redhead. We're in a tight spot because of what you did to the Matter. Do you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>252</td>
<td>Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>253</td>
<td>He's Sol? As in...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>254</td>
<td>As in the leader of the Templars?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>255</td>
<td>He's the one who killed Captain Yauras! He killed Captain Othima and Seida, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>256</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>257</td>
<td>You speak as though I'm some murderer. You lot started this, remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>258</td>
<td>The leader of the Templars?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>259</td>
<td>He's the one that killed our Captains?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>260</td>
<td>A wise man sees his neighbor's residence on fire and checks his own hearth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>261</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>262</td>
<td>It means it would be wise to pluck the buds of distress before they bloom. I won't let you derail our plans again, redhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>263</td>
<td>I'll kill you first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>264</td>
<td>You're not going to steal Lucifer in place of the Matter, are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>265</td>
<td>Of course I will. Mercenaries don't work for free.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>266</td>
<td>We won't let you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>267</td>
<td>He's only one man! Get him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>268</td>
<td>S-stop! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>269</td>
<td>...Bang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>270</td>
<td>Aaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>271</td>
<td>No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>272</td>
<td>What the hell was that?!</td>
