<td>Seriously...I said I'll leave it to the two of you, but you took it way too far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Do you two understand?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes, yes. We're sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Further information leaks, removal of prototype weapons, and organizing the infiltration of foreign knights into our country...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Everything worked out in the end, but it could very well have ended up with something far worse than me being fired from my position!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>In this one day, I feel like I've aged a decade's worth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But everything worked out in the end, right? Come on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't 'come on' me! After blowing up this situation to this scale, I can only imagine what he'll say...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>He? Who gives the head of the Technology Division grievances?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You two really pulled a number, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Vi-Vincent?! The Wizard of the Machine World'?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Don't call me that, Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Fo-Former Director...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh...right, I forgot about him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Amis...why do you think I pushed you into the position of Director?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Even if I throw you a handful of a job, your talent is supposed to be that you can always complete it tactfully!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So why am I being bothered by this fiasco? I retired because I didn't want to get involved in this kind of stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I have no excuse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huh? Wasn't that just plain abusive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>When that guy's in a bad mood, there's no talking logic to him. Let it go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well, it's over now. Regarding what happened this time, part of it can be handled by calling in some favors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The joint training should handle any inquiries by Gluttony...we can throw what happened with Saga into the mix as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Unlike Michael, I'm not the type who takes care of other people's messes, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We're on board now so we might as well. I'll have a talk with the person in charge of Northern Pride's external affairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Th-thank you, Former Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I won't be going out of my way. Just know that. Oh, as for you from the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Y-yes?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If possible, I'd like for you to keep hanging out with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Technicians tend to withdraw from the world and become closed off in their thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>A-ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Who's he calling closed off?! He's the textbook example of that term!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Totally...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You seem to be lacking energy. Are you feeling down about something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's not that, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I was just thinking how there really are a lot of countries with different ways of thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I need to learn to understand that better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I want to do something for all the knights that I serve with...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And for all those who've accepted my savage ways...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Why don't you just do what you can?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Us technical types tend to be completely useless outside of our expertise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's why we put our heads together and brainstorm, which eventually progresses into research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Even then, you'll still get tired of always failing. You'll have days where you give up and get depressed, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>There's no need to do everything yourself. You just need to know what it is you can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I think you're pretty good at that. More importantly, you're endearing to those around you. Trust is one of the biggest assets you can have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You think so...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You know, we're chasing the impossible dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'm talking about the airships. They're the image of our dreams. They're pegged to be the symbol of Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>To be honest, we still don't have a clear set time for completion. Everything is just an estimate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Still, we believe that it will, one day, be finished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What I mean to say is that the airships are our pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Because we share this same vision, we can remain as friends and colleagues. It's all about a state of mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's why you and Amis are always so passionate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You have that as well, don't you? That kind of pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Y-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(My pride is to make the Captain and all the other knights smile...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>In that case, stop worrying about it and just do what you can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What you can't do, somebody will help you with. That's what friends are for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Megistos, I used to think you were just a cannon-wearing idiot, but you're actually contemplating a lot of stuff in your mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>(Yes, I've changed my opinion of him just a little. Maybe...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Well, more than you with your savage mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hey, wait! What did you just say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Shut up! Look at you, worrying about something so stupid! You ruined the positive atmosphere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Huh?! I never asked for your encouragement!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hey, but that's the kind of vibe you were giving off! You were like a cat wanting attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Don't call me a cat! I'm obviously a tiger! A tiger!!!</td>
</tr>
