<td>The ancient Alchemy ruins... I never would've thought that the Lizard Brigade would be nesting there.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>That's the information we received from the villager just now. We believe it is highly reliable.</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>Hmm. Dias.</td>

<td>Yes?</td>

<td>At the village, why did you refuse to annihilate them? I thought I told you not to give in to sentiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We are here to destroy the Lizard Brigade. To turn our blades against villagers, who have no intention of fighting us, runs contrary to the way of chivalry.</td>

<td>And if the villagers were to show signs of hostility, what would you do then?</td>

<td>If they showed hostility towards me?</td>

<td>Dias, you have a dark shadow hanging over you. Can you still not erase the sorrow from your past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Nothing. Just don't forget the voices of those who seek for a way to coexist with Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Keep in mind, that you are the son of a noble captain of Envylia.</td>
