<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hmm? Have I been here before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, I'm positive he will make a move by sundown tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Not even his habit of fine wine and women will deter him from such a lucrative deal.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Really, Rox, I wonder how you even get these kinds of information...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmph! That's none of your business!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Just... Just be on time and in position, all right? Sheesh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Heheh. Don't worry, I've got it all covered.</td>

<td>Schooling her features, Roxanne sighs and scouts out her surroundings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(Never mind. There are more pressing matters at hand.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(That looks like a good spot.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Slinging her sniper rifle over a shoulder, Roxanne climbs into a high alcove and surveys the area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(The archives, hmm?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(Sneaking around, I suppose...)</td>

<td>018</td>
<td>...Well then! A decoy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I do enjoy a more...riveting contest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Picking up the fizzling remains of a hologram device, Roxanne turns and smirks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You're mistaken if you think you've succeeded in drawing me out into the open.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Or did you truly believe a sniper would be disadvantaged this close?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The rumors around Slothstein were true...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You look...just like her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Were you with Goetia all this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Rox, is that... Is that really you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well now. I see where the Doktor gets his ideas for his contrivances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And to think I've just come off a training session and into the real deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Sorry to say, but standard protocol would be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>If this is your idea of a sick joke, I'm not laughing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I've been looking for so long, and you-!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Should we be acquainted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's me. Siegfried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I... We were...friends. More than that, even.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What happened to you? What did they do to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Rox...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Sieg...fried?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(Why does that name sound so familiar?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Make another move and it'll be your last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(Amnesia? Or something else?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh? What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It came from over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Damn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
