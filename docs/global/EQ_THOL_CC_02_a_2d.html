<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Ah, the prodigy child makes his appearance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir's Subordinate</td>
<td>Boss. We found this one trying to break into our safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>I'm glad you caught him. I've been wanting to meet him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>You...know who I am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Any successful loan shark knows to keep up with the latest news and trends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Word on the streets is that there's been someone in this region of Lost Blue causing trouble through tyranny and pillaging. Then you show up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Heh, I figured a loan shark like you would have a good bit of cash saved up somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>This is the only job that gets me any real profit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Aren't you the head of a pretty big underground organization?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>I have no interest in being a leader or helping to usher in a new age. We're all just here to make some money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Here in Lost Blue? There's gotta be other places easier to do business and turn a profit than a place filled with trouble like this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Trouble like you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>I just don't want to let any moment of this life go to waste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>I see. Idealistic, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>I survive by stealing what I need, and I watch out for myself. That's how you gotta be to make it down here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>So you value your life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Of course I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>And how is this wasteless life you lead? Any fun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Do you have to be so abrasive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>I'm sorry, I must have left my manners behind when your men dragged me in here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Rather than stealing, have you ever considered that borrowing with the promise of paying trust back in dividends might be more rewarding in the long run?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>I'm sure those words aren't self-serving at all, coming from a profiteer like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Ha. Aren't we all just biding time until we die? In that light, maybe life itself is the waste: why not enjoy it while you can?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Aren't the futile things we do the whole point of living?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Try to look a little bit more lively. You ought to learn the pleasures of an honest day's work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Even if that work isn't honest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Everybody's got enemies here in Lost Blue. Why not earn a little peace of mind by finding some people to watch your back? At the very least, it might help you rediscover your manners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>There's no peace of mind that I'm willing to compromise my way of life for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Well, well, the very personification of the phrase 'no rest for the weary', aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Do you like to read?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>You know how?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>With the leisure of time, you can read some books. You could study the past to look into the future. You might even learn to have some ambition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Ambition...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>For example: I want to bring down a dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>You're missing a few screws, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Have you seen one before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>No, because there aren't any.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Some old texts say they used to soar through the blue skies in ancient times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>They used to look down upon the world, these gloriously indomitable creatures at the top of the food chain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Well, there aren't any today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>An unseen legendary beast. A monster no person can subdue. A nonexistent threat to the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>You even just said they're nonexistent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>I polish my skills. I gather funds, weapons, and friends. All in preparation for my chance, when it comes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>You've lost me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Hey, are you even hearing me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Dragons, you know? What is greater than a dragon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Here I was wondering what kind of person would be able to make it to the top of the Tower Veda...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Oh, a fan, are you? You'll be glad to know I'm actually planning to add to my record as we speak. Your support would be very appreciated, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>I actually heard a rumor that you were severely burned in your last little escapade to the surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Is that what people are saying? How embarrassing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>I figured this was my chance to take you out and set myself up for life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>The simple-minded thinking of an animal. So you thought you'd come after little old injured me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>That's the way things are done here in Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Did you think you were the first to come up with that idea? There have been many.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>And yet you're the only one who actually listened to what I have to say. You've made me happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>As a favor to you, we'll play by your silly little rules. Only...if I win, I get to steal you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Wh-what do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>I will teach you the pleasure of an honest day's work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>And if I win?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>That's just not going to happen.</td>
</tr>
