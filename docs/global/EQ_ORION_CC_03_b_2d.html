<td>002</td>
<td>Sorry to have gone so far astray. I got a bit sidetracked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What am I to do with you if you can't even follow simple directions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Or could it be you ran into some assassins, perhaps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Can't hide anything from you, it seems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh. That was supposed to be a joke! Did you defeat them alone, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You've become strong indeed, Orion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What's gotten into you? Have you been drugged or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Very funny. Learn to take a compliment, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Indeed. I suppose you're not the only one acting out of character today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>A necklace? Heh. It looks like a belled animal collar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I thought it would be best to show my appreciation for allowing me to come here with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>They say the bell is thought to bring good fortune to travelers. I hope it brings some to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hmph. So the kitten gives the wolf its collar, then? You might be taking that pet name of yours a little too seriously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If you don't like it, you're welcome to dispose of it when I'm not looking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's the plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It seems you've enjoyed your stay in Wratharis, though, if this is anything to go by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes, it was quite the experience. It makes me want to explore the whole continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The whole thing, eh? If that's what you got out of this venture, then I have a question for you:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Isn't this the perfect opportunity to kill me? It's just the two of us, here in a foreign land. Is there any better setting for a quick and easy murder?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You've got a point. Though I'm not particularly feeling it right now. Not while my sense of wonder from seeing the larger world for the first time is still fresh in my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's about what I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You know you'd be able to explore the world freely right now, if you just cut ties with Mammon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That way I can get what I want, and you can travel to your heart's content; we both feed our desires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We'd both get what we want, eh? Not a bad idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You've gotten too strong. I may have to challenge you myself after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You know Mammon would never allow that. Nor would it be particularly wise to unleash Mammon's power in a place like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Still worried about that? That giving in to your bloodlust might cause Mammon to take control of you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, fear not, for this can all end now. I'll be taking everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Come out, Mammon! I'm the one you want! Choose me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Grah! Wh-what are you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Have you ever wondered why potential successors aren't allowed outside of the kingdom?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Because the power of Mammon's Greed, and the protection it offers...would be lessened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Nicely deduced. And that's a limitation not even Mammon's future host can overcome!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Gahh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It seems this was worth the trip after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I've satisfied every condition the emperor laid out for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Come, Mammon! Leave that weakling behind, and feast upon the blood of one who is truly worthy of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hrgh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Mammon has now chosen me. You rejected the power of Greed, but I, little more than a pitiful attendant, have taken up your slack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>So this is the real reason you brought me out of Greed Dike on this journey with you? You sought the chance to ambush me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You think I can't handle this power, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You know what bearing Mammon entails. That's why I should be the one—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'll gladly take all of the despair it gives me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A mix of emotions flooded through me on this first journey of mine to another land, but the strongest among them at this moment was the sense that something just...wasn't quite right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Although Langhao had achieved her goal and gotten her hands on Mammon, nothing—not her words, nor her actions, nor her mannerisms—seemed in keeping with the Langhao I'd come to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Regardless, I had been bested, as far as I knew. So after a time, upon our return to Greed Dike...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We were called before the current emperor and informed that Langhao had officially been chosen as the successor, in my place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Evidently, the arranged marriage had been agreed upon, too. And so, the first empress in the history of Greed Dike came to be, with ties to Wratharis in tow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It should have been a happy occasion for her, but each time I shot her a sidewards glance, she always looked very unsure of herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I decided to follow through with this observation, and see where the thread may lead.</td>
