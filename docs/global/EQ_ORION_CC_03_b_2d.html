</tr>
<tr>

<td>Evidently, the arranged marriage had been agreed upon, too. And so, the first empress in the history of Greed Dike came to be, with ties to Wratharis in tow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>It should have been a happy occasion for her, but each time I shot her a sidewards glance, she always looked very unsure of herself.</td>

<td>I decided to follow through with this observation, and see where the thread may lead.</td>
