<td>Tsk. All these people. They look at someone's face, call them a fraud, and just keep on complaining.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Just because I won a little in gambling. It's horrible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Old man...were you being picked on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Who are you? This is the amusement area. It's not place for kids. Get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But...you look sad, old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Look. I'm not an old man, and I'm not sad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm just upset.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Why are you upset?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sigh. I was gambling in the tavern, and I won a tiny bit too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Then, those scum tried to pick a fight with me saying that I had cheated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh, sorry kid. I guess you don't know difficult words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There they are right now. They were real jealous of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Are you talented...old man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What's with the suspicious eyes? Fine. Watch this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Look at these cards. They're the ones that I actually use in a match. You've at least seen cards before, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You shuffle and mix them up like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Now choose one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>All right... This one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's the Queen of Hearts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You can try again. I'll guess each one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wow! You're amazing, old man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's nothingâ€”just a trick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I memorized them all when I shuffled the deck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...Hold on, what am I doing? There's no gain in showing all of this to some kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey...old man, since you showed me something amazing, I'll show you my secret as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huh? Your secret?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Woody, say hi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...?! Did the doll just move?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Woody, this old man is amazing. Clap your hands! Clap, clap!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...Hey, hold on. You're using some kind of phantom art, aren't it? It's a fake, like mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No, but it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Woody is family! He's not a fake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>She's gone... Ack. That child...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Lord Magnus! The enemy is invading. Our allies request urgent aid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Argh. It's just one thing after another, and it's getting on my nerve.</td>
