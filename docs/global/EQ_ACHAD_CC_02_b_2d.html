<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>You don't want to fight?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You ungrateful little worm! Who do you have to thank for being alive? Who's the one who brought you up from nothing? Are you just going to throw all of that back in my face?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hmm... I suppose Bianca could draw in the customers. I've left her alone up till now, because you've been doing so well in your fights. Would you have her become my new moneymaker?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>N-No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If you're so intent on not fighting, how about you just die instead? You get plenty of chances to kick the bucket every damn day! Why complain to me when you can just take one? To spite me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No, go on! Go get yourself killed! Just lose a match, and throw it all away! I won't miss you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Do you even have a reason to live? If you're not going to earn your keep, keel over and die, right now! When your body grows cold and lifeless, you won't have to fight ever again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You're good-for-nothing garbage! Utterly worthless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>When you're not fighting, all you do is take up space! Understand?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I will do my best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, there's a fresh perspective. These war orphans aren't normally treated like humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>To the people who buy and sell them, they're just a cheap commodity with a variety of uses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>They can provide manual labor, learn circus tricks, become guinea pigs for experiments...whatever you need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>To top it all off, they're pretty malleable. Easy enough to keep them from rebelling against you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You just have to convince them that it's their fault, not yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Make them feel responsible for some of the damage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>"And the victory goes to Amu! Another glorious bloodbath, ladies and gentlemen!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>"Amu! Amu! Amu! Amu!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>"Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>My stomach hurts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The more I fight, the more it hurts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry, but...if I don't... If I don't fight, then I'll...I'll be thrown away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And then Bianca... Poor Bianca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Listen how they cheer for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I-I really thought that if I kept doing my best, then someday... Someday...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>For your blood to be splattered across these walls! You've kept them waiting for ever so long!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Someday someone would...p-praise me. Be...kind to me. Even though I'm such a stupid... Such a...a... Uwaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I hope you enjoyed it while it lasted! Did you like prancing around in that ridiculous dress of yours? Did it feel good to fight while the crowd cheered you on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I did everything I was told!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So why does my stomach still hurt?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I always did the best I could! Every single day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Nihil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Shh. Just leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Let me handle this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>"Amu! Amu! Amu! Amu!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Aaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Rraaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Haa...haa...haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Your strength is incredible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I'm kinda jealous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I-I never wanted it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I-I'm only strong because I had to be! For Bianca! To survive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You did your best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You fought, and fought well, because you had no other choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Th-there was nothing to eat! I-I couldn't talk! I couldn't do a-anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The only freedom I had was the freedom to move my hands. I wanted to use them to help, but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But helping wouldn't fill your belly. You had to kill to drink blood, to live another day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I-I've killed so many people! I even drank their blood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I've done s-so many terrible th-things!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Sometimes, you have to do despicable things to survive. That's how it is for people like us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>P-people like...us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yes, us. We're all terrible. But there's no point stressing about it and giving yourself a bellyache. Been there, done that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Instead...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>How about you keep doing your best, but for yourself this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'm just saying... Why not fight to turn this messed up world on its head?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You've got the strength to make it happen. You just need to keep going, and put the past behind you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You can still put those hands of yours to good use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>My...hands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Use 'em to fight back. An eye for an eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Unless you're happy to just let all your grudges go unsettled? Do you really want to carry them around on your back forever?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Do you want to be on the receiving end until the day you die? No? Then you've gotta speak up. You've gotta show the people who corralled you that you're not ready to lay down and die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You've got to survive, whatever it takes. And when you're put on the chopping block, you'll have no choice but to take on the role of the villain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You're starving, aren't you? Well, so are we.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I am very hungry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>We couldn't just leave her behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>That doesn't mean she has to follow us all the way to Veda!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Hey, Amu. Since Nihil's too busy having a tantrum to hear this, allow me to let you in on a little secret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I'm literally right here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It's about that eyepatch of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I can hear every word you're saying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>That day, Nihil wanted an excuse to talk to you, and that eyepatch was the best thing he could come up with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Ohh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Shut up! That's not true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>As for why he had it on him in the first place...he actually bought it for himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I suppose he wanted to show off, or something like that. Perhaps he thought it'd make him look cool and dangerous, like a war veteran?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You know, most people associate eyepatches with pirates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Aha! See? He was definitely trying to show off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Was not. I was planning on trying it out for the same reason many pirates do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Isn't that usually because they lost an eye?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Sometimes, but I've also heard it helps them fight better in the dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>For example, when boarding an enemy vessel, you might have to move between a bright, sunlit deck and a dark hold. Your eyes would need to adjust, but you don't have time for that when every second is life or death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>However, if one of your eyes was covered by an eyepatch, that eye would already be used to the dark. You'd only need to remove the patch to be able to see your surroundings and leap instantly into the fray.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Wow. What an infodump.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Ooh! Interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Come on, be honest. You also thought it'd make you look cool, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Just a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>You two really are polar opposites.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>On the one hand, we've got Amu, who barely says anything at all; on the other, we have Nihil, who talks way, way too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Hey, if you don't make yourself heard in this world, you'll wind up being forgotten. So if you've got something to say, you have to speak up, or lose out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I've been thinking this for a long time, but you really need someone strong enough to listen to those rants of yours and...reflect them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Reflect them? As in, back at me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>No, silly. Out to the rest of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>You balance each other out, like a positive and negative charge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I guess we do make a pretty good team.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Oho! I thought you hated kids, women, and animals?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I do. A lot. They're the top three scariest things in this world. And the strongest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Mystic Tower Veda - 100th Floor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Heed me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>You who have followed in the footsteps of your predecessor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Wielder of dark powers, who wishes for the world to acknowledge him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I hear a...voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>What? I don't hear anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>You two wait here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>You sure? Not even Dead Nine has gone beyond the hundredth floor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Someone's waiting for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>My name is Nero. I am the darkness. That is all I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I am a pioneer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I am she who seeks to break this world with truth. I am she who would twist the threads of fate. I am power incarnate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Do you crave power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Give me your sacrifice, and you will receive...a revelation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Pay the price, and you will receive the power you seek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>All right. Sounds good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>You're not afraid?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Why would I be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>All I do is provide the opportunity for power to be gained. As for those who seize this chance...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>They must give up that which makes them who they are, or that which keeps them going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>In doing so, they will receive an explosive boost in power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Would that satisfy you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Are you truly willing to discard your identity? To shatter your personality? You should know that most of those who undergo this transformation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Lose their sanity as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Every single weak-willed person who has sought power beyond what they are capable of has ended up losing sight of who they are, destroying themselves in the process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>They have become...inhuman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>However, such failures can never be undone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Now, tell me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Do you have something you consider important to you? Do you have someone or something that ensures you never lose sight of yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Would you be willing to give up that person or thing in exchange for power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Will you still be able to hold on to your humanity, even after you have lost that crucial part of you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>I've already made up my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>(The truth is...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>This is exactly what I want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>(I'm scared out of my wits.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Amu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Do you really have to do this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>I'm not fit to be the villain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Why are you rushing into this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Amu? What is it? What did you hear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>How can you agree to something so...terrifying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>(I...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Don't do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Amu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Don't follow me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Don't disappear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Wh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>You're all I have left!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Amu...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Why must humans have such inflexible wills?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>That voice sounded so familiar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Not that I can talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>I can barely wield my own powers... All I do is destroy every last human whose path crosses mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>For what reason was I born? Was it only to destroy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>So I ran towards it, without hesitation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>What am I? What is my purpose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>I have made yet another failure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>I never meant to make anyone sad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Will I ever get it right, I wonder?</td>
</tr>
