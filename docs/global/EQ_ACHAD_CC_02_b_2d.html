<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>I suppose he wanted to show off, or something like that. Perhaps he thought it'd make him look cool and dangerous, like a war veteran?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You know, most people associate eyepatches with pirates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Aha! See? He was definitely trying to show off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Was not. I was planning on trying it out for the same reason many pirates do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>Isn't that usually because they lost an eye?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Sometimes, but I've also heard it helps them fight better in the dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>For example, when boarding an enemy vessel, you might have to move between a bright, sunlit deck and a dark hold. Your eyes would need to adjust, but you don't have time for that when every second is life or death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>However, if one of your eyes was covered by an eyepatch, that eye would already be used to the dark. You'd only need to remove the patch to be able to see your surroundings and leap instantly into the fray.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Wow. What an infodump.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>Ooh! Interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Come on, be honest. You also thought it'd make you look cool, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Just a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>You two really are polar opposites.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>On the one hand, we've got Amu, who barely says anything at all; on the other, we have Nihil, who talks way, way too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Hey, if you don't make yourself heard in this world, you'll wind up being forgotten. So if you've got something to say, you have to speak up, or lose out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>I've been thinking this for a long time, but you really need someone strong enough to listen to those rants of yours and...reflect them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Reflect them? As in, back at me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>No, silly. Out to the rest of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Amu</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yes.</td>
