<td>Good morning, Reida.</td>

<td>Good morning, Reido.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Today I have prepared for you a very nourishing meal with some new ingredients that I found. I hope you like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That is very thoughtful. Thank you, Reida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ah... Delicious as always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm so glad! Nothing makes me as happy as seeing you happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Reida, there's something I'd like to discuss with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes, brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You see, I had been a little puzzled as to why my nighttime escapades were going so well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Even so, I believed that there was no reason not to continue. If I died, it just meant that my life was ended a little earlier than expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Or, at least, that was how I justified it to myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yet I see now that it was your efforts to follow me and clean up after my messes that kept me safe all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I only did what I wanted to do. There's no reason for you to dwell on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Thank you, Reida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I truly cannot express how grateful I am for all that you have done for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I have been taking you for granted. I am sorry that I didn't realize that until yesterday. Please forgive me for my inattention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>There is nothing to forgive. I treasure the time I have spent watching over you and witnessing how kind you truly are. I will never feel as loved as I did when I saw what you were doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You have nothing to be sorry for. There's no reason for you to waste your breath on such words. I was happy to do all of it for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Reida, there's something else I have to talk to you about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I think that I...am not long for this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Reido, please! Don't talk like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I am sorry, but you must listen to me. Up until now, I have done my best to live without causing you unnecessary burdens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That is what I wanted to do, but... Alas, I clearly failed. You've even had to clean up after my messes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>How many times do I have to say it? I don't see you as a burden! I don't mind doing all of this because I love you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Thank you, Reida. Allow me to rephrase...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What I want—what would make me happiest—is to be able to do something for you before I die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Reido...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Reida, there must be something that you wish for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I... I don't know what to say! Any wish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Any wish that is within my power to grant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>In the end... I want it to be my hand that ends your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You are the most precious thing in the world to me. I have been thinking about how I could keep you with me forever, and little else, all these years...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This is my answer. If I am the one to take your life, then you will never be anyone else’s. Only mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Being able to feel the fire of your life drain away beneath my hands...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>And gazing into your eyes as it happens, seeing myself reflected in them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That is my wish. That is the answer that my love for you has brought me to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Is it...too much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No. It's perfect. You are perfect. I am delighted that that is your wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I would love nothing more than for you to be the last thing reflected in my eyes. There is nothing else I would rather see as I die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Thank you, Reida. I look forward to that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>No, Reido... Thank you! I promise that until that day, I will do all I can for you!</td>
</tr>
