<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What are you thinking about? You've got this look on your face... Anything I can do to help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hm? No, no... I was just thinking about the Scarlet Flame Guard. We've really come far since the three of us made that vow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ah. We've got a lot more recruits since we became a properly recognized knight order, and we've been in a lot more different kinds of battles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wratharis hasn't made any big moves since that time... Even though Zahar isn't around anymore, there's no telling when they'll try something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Your eye... Does it still hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Sometimes, but it's a good reminder to myself about what it is to be weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Why don't I make some medicine for your eye, Vettel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Haha! No, it's fine. It's better for you to focus on taking care of Gerald and the rest of the knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Well...if you say so... I'm getting a lot of practice recently in healing. I can tell that it's having an effect; that I'm improving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah, you've been great. We really couldn't have gone from three people to an entIra Knight order without you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I wonder what we will become next? Can the three of us stick together and continue to move forward like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What are you saying? You trying to jinx us? Of course we can! After all, we have quite the leader.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Haha, alright. I suppose this is the time for action, not self-reflection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huh? Gerald? What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I put together some rules. We've gotten a number of new recruits, so I figured we need something like this to make sure everyone is on the same page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>"We shall not allow ourselves to be blind to the plight of those who can be saved. There is no prejudice in the Scarlet Flame Guard. Respect none who wield the sword without heart."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>"Dedicate your sword to the pursuit of justice. All knights of the Scarlet Flame Guard will abide by these rules. Any who do not follow this decree will be cast out."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Strict, as befitting Ironheart Gerald.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's the nickname you've earned yourself for being so hard on everyone, especially yourself. The joke going around is that pure iron flows through your veins. Hence, "Ironheart".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Plus, you've always been hard-headed and tunnel-visioned. The nickname fits you, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>On the other hand, here we've got "Sunbright Vettel" who is popular with everyone, especially the ladies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You ought to take some cues from him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hmph. I have no complaints about "Ironheart".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Come on. Isn't it too harsh to just kick them out if they mess up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I agree with Natalie. Seems a little much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Right now, the Scarlet Flame Guard is just a ragtag team of all sorts. The least we can do is make sure that we have a precise code of honor for all of our members to follow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This is exactly the amount of rigor we need to protect the Scarlet Flame. We must prioritize that code of honor at all costs. Anyone unwilling to pay the price will simply have to give up on being a knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hm, you have a point. Since Wratharis haven't shown their faces for a while and we don't know yet when they'll pop up...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Plus, since Lord Commander Zain, Hero of Envylia, passed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's better to be prepared for anything rather than to react. The rest of the Scarlet Flame Guard will be informed of these provisions at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Really, Vettel? You're going along with this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You can quit if it is too much for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Excuse me?! As if I would! You can't get rid of me that easily! Besides, what would you even do without my medicines?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Excuse me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ah, Victor. What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yes...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ah! Um, I'm so sorry! I was just overwhelmed for a moment! I never thought that a lowly knight like me would ever be able to... It is an honor to speak to you directly, Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Woah. What's going on with you, Victor? You wanna try some of this medicine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>U-um, I think I'm okay? What is that medicine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Medicine for improving mental capacities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What?! Wait, yeah! I wanna try it! Wait... Does that kind of medicine really exist?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Obviously not! These are just supplements! Well... I mean, they might still help someone like you. I mean, what is with you? This is a weird time to start getting flustered speaking to Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Flustered...? Oh... I mean, I was just thinking that it's really only the Scarlet Flame Guard where someone like me could speak directly to the Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Ah... Well, I see you more as comrades than underlings. After all, only those who share our principles are able to join us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Furthermore, everyone here is treated the same way. Even I would probably be expelled from the Scarlet Flame Guard if Gerald caught me breaking our code of honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The most important thing in the Scarlet Flame Guard is not pedigree, but honor and justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Wow, wow, wow! That was such a cool thing to say! I do not regret joining the Scarlet Flame Guard at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Haha. Now, Victor... What was it you came to talk to me for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oh, yeah! Um, ahem, so... I was thinking that Commander Chloe is taking a little bit too much time coming back from that volcano, so maybe I should, um...check on her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You're getting ahead of yourself worrying about Chloe. Give it another shot when you've actually mastered all we've been trying to teach you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hold up. He's got a point. It's about time to send someone to just check in and make sure that everything is fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I thought you trusted Chloe to take care of herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Of course I do. It just wouldn't be strange for something to go down, so we might as well send someone ahead of time to be safe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Our duties include planning for any possible scenario, don't you think, Gerald?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hmph. I suppose I have no counter-argument to that. Victor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Y-yessir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Here is your first mission: Find Chloe, back her up as necessary, and make sure that the both of you return intact. Hmph. A fitting first mission for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Understood! Leave it to me! This is great! I'm super pumped! I'll definitely get the both of us back safe and sound!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Just get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Will he be all right on his own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>If he couldn't complete a mission like this, he wouldn't even be in the Guard. Trust your people a little more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I suppose you have a point. Go on, Victor. Complete this mission successfully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Captain Vettel, I have bad news! Rioters are destroying Envylia's castle town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The castle town?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>There has been strong opposition to the policies intended to integrate the therians into society. It has been causing issues with public order in Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Tensions have been building for a while, and they boiled over into today's riot! We have received an urgent request to deploy our men to restore order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>We still have a long way to go until we can have true peace, huh... Scarlet Flame Guard, ready yourselves for deployment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Almost there... I'm coming to help you, Commander Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hm? What're you doing here? This area is off-limits, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>A knight? I need your help! My companion went off to that mountain over there and hasn't returned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What?! What were the two of you even doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>We got real lost and I said, "Nah, I'm not going any further, this place ain't right," but they just kept on going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Please, mister knight! Go find my friend and bring them back here! They went that way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>But...I'm kind of in the middle of something here... Er... Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I am Victor of the Scarlet Flame Guard! I must help all those in need, just like Captain Vettel and Sir Gerald are always saying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Wait here, friend! I will go find your companion and bring them back immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Commander Chloe, I'm sorry, kind of...but I think you would do the same thing if you were me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'm gonna go find this person and then make my way straight to your side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Eek...! Stop it... Stop it! Don't come any closer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Hyaaaaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Wh-who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I am Victor of the Scarlet Flame Guard! Hurry back to your village! Your friend is waiting for you there! Go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>B-but there's so many goblins and just one of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Numbers mean nothing in my code of honor! Not saving you is not an option! Go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>That is the creed of the Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Forget about me! Run back to your friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Th-Thank you... Please don't die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Heh heh. Yeah... I mean... That'd be great, but...there really are quite a few of these jerks, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Well, there's nothing for it. Brother, sister... Watch me! I'm gonna kick a bunch of goblin butt and then complete my first mission ever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I'll prove that I, Victor, am worthy of being a knight of the Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
</tr>
