<td>We've managed to chase them all outside. That being said, what was driving them into such a frenzy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>My guess is that this was the cause.</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>Huh? This candy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What?! But I haven't put anything strange inside it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>True...unlike last time... there aren't any particularly strange ingredients in this candy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey. There wasn't anything necessarily strange in the candy we had previously either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>... ...</td>

<td>It's true that the ingredients themselves are relatively normal. However, since Neica was the one who made them, her powerful mana must have affected the finished product.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There's enough powerful mana in this candy to make all these Rattys get excited?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>St-stop, please! I don't possess any powerful mana!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hey, would it be all right to distribute that candy? You're gonna give these to the townsfolk, right? Are you sure it won't poison them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The ingredients are of the regular sort. Besides, I can only sense a small amount of mana from this candy. It's unlikely to have an effect on them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>However, for some reason, those Rattys alone seem to be responding strongly to the mana within the candy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hey, Magnus. What happened to the Rattys who stole the candy and ran away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...This isn't looking good. If the smell alone causes them to react like that, imagine what might happen if they actually eat the candy. They could go on a rampage all across town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We've got no time to waste! Everyone, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Numaaa! Numaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hey, Rattys! Stop going crazy all over the town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Numa, numu, numaaa! Numa, numu, numaaa! Numa, numu, numaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's not working. They've worked themselves into a frenzy. I can't get through to them. I've no choice but to calm them a little forcefully.</td>
