<td>Why are you trying so hard to keep us away from Asmodeus?!</td>

<td>If we obtain Asmodeus, we can remove the curse of Arestorus, right?!</td>

<td>That stone is proof of my birth. You could almost call it my umbilical cord.</td>

<td>If Mother did not use that stone, she would not have been joined together with my father.</td>

<td>This country's curse was a necessary price for my birth.</td>

<td>That's why you want to say that the curse is necessary for this country, right?</td>

<td>In order to make sure that the other witches don't approach the Sacred Stone, you placed all the responsibility on Mother.</td>
</tr>

<td>Shut up...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Mother originally sought Asmodeus and broke the law because she wanted all witches to be able to love...it's written so in the songs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You buried Mother's resolve in our history and tailored her existence to suit your purposes. Isn't that right?!</td>
</tr>

<td>024</td>
<td>Shuuuuut uuuuup!!!</td>
