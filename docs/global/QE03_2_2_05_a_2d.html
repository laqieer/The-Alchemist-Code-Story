<td>Th-there's no end to them. How many monsters can you summon?!</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>These results come from an unbroken effort of witches throughout the history of Lustburg. With your lack of experience, you are no match for me.</td>

<td>It stings my pride to see just how inferior we are!</td>

<td>Why do you think the witches of this country worked so hard to improve their magic?</td>

<td>In the past, the witches of this country sought Asmodeus in the clouds much like you are now. However, they could not reach it.</td>

<td>Some rode on brooms to fly, others would hold out wooden sticks in an attempt to pluck the Sacred Stone from the sky, but not one could reach it.</td>

<td>Magic could not reach Alchemy. We decided never again to repeat our mistake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>That is why we continue to improve our magic, in order to obtain a power that can stand against Alchemy.</td>

<td>Prepare yourself, Lisbeth Finn Lustburg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>This country has suffered under the curse of Alchemy. You must be made to understand the grudge we witches hold and how we oppose it with magic.</td>
</tr>
