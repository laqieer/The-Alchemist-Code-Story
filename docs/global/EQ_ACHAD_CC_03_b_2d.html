<td>"Dragons still exist. Even if we can't see them with our eyes."</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>"The current ruling class of this world. The inequality we suffer thanks to the outer world that surrounds Lost Blue. Malice, deceit, and the so-called absolute justice..."</td>
</tr>

<td>003</td>
<td>"Even if it seems impossible, we need to become strong enough to change the world before Greed Dike cheats us to death, or else there is no tomorrow for us."</td>

<td>You know, I've been praying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Haa...haa...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes, praying that you would come and kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Haha. Me, specifically?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We're both assassins, aren't we? By the by, do you know what they called you in Corpse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You've heard of me, huh? Small world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>They call you the cowardly street urchin. Like a name. The Cowardly Street Urchin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You understand why, don't you? Because you wait in the shadows to pounce on targets stronger than yourself. Because you waste your precious youth on dirty jobs. Because, even now, you devote yourself to assassination from the safety of the lion's shadow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But whatever they may think of your methods, they can't help but be jealous of your results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>At the end of the day, you can't depend on God.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>True enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You'll sooner die of starvation than receive any aid from the so-called Almighty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Before the dragon gobbles us all up, I want to shine light bright as any sun on all of Terra.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Will you kill me to achieve that goal? Is that why you continue to be the Cowardly Street Urchin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't have the strength to take an honorable path. I've just gotta work to earn my keep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's a dirty path to tread. A bloody road to walk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Fine by me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>How long do you plan on being a social outcast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Things would be so much easier if I could act openly. But I can't. I have to operate from the shadows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>After all, there's no sun in Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Isn't there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And we've no power to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's why I have to change the world. Everything. From the ground up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You think you can pull that off, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I don't know. But I have to try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Even if it costs me my youth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oho!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Bravo! Bravissimo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What're you prattling about now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This makes you the right man for the part!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You will become the sun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Come again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Acting is imitation! Impersonation! Those with their name on the cast list are obligated to live up to their role!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Create and name your persona! Write your own drama! That's how rulers set the stage upon which they can fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Leave a strong enough impression, and your false melody will linger in the audience's hearts forever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The spotlight might be a lie, but to those who languish in the darkness of the wings, it's the sun itself! It's everything they aspire to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>So what you're saying is that I should just pretend to be the sun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>God is dead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The age of begging supernatural beings to save us is long past! Prayer will not bring our salvation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>That's why we need someone who transcends humanity! Someone unafraid to blaspheme and burn the establishment to the ground!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>We need a human who inspires more faith than any god!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>A human among humans! A true ruler!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Of course, picking out such a person from amongst the hundreds of millions who populate this world would be like finding a needle in a haystack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Only a fool would dare hope for such a feat—a fool such as myself! Only my discerning eyes could have perceived that my killer would be the one capable of playing the part!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes! This was your audition, my liege!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You're insane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Everyone has been waiting for you! One day, the entire underground will revolve around you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yes, you! For you are deplorable, miserable, pitiable, spineless, suspicious, inexperienced, and fundamentally ambitious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>And to top it all off, you've got an insatiable lust for power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You sure like to talk a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>For now, this jester shall take his leave. I'm sure you have a lot to think about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But I do wonder if you intend to have someone else pay the price...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Just remember to strike while the iron's hot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Arms up. I'll help you pull them through the sleeves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It really is a lovely dress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It looks good on you. The master must've wanted you to look extra cute today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>They're still not feeding you a lot, huh? How do they expect you to fight on an empty stomach?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Go on, Amu. I don't mind. Really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>No. No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>It's hard, isn't it? To be so deprived that you're afraid of taking from others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You're such a kind girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Don't worry about me. Your teeth don't hurt me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>It hurts me so much more when I see you all sad and troubled like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>If you're afraid, just squeeze my hand, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Mmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>There you go. See? It's not that bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Just gently sink your teeth in...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Her blood had a metallic tang to it, but her hand was so warm and comforting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Even after I finished drinking, I didn't let go. I held on tight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Good morning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I said some magic words to reduce the pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You were asleep for a long time, but we were able to keep your vitals going with Vier's special techniques.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I am the fifth of the Veda Templars. You can call me Füry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Veda?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Like Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Sol?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I don't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>There, there. Easy does it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>The air was thick with a metallic smell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Another failure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I swallowed up both of the uninvited guests...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>And so the girl paid the price for the boy's power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I...tried to replace what was lost. But I don't know if it will be sufficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Both of the girl's arms were taken as compensation, yet she gained no power in turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>The girl lost everything, and the boy gained his heart's desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Why must it always end in tragedy? No matter how many times I try... No matter what I do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>No, I... I was the one who decided to follow you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I was just so sick of being ignored. I wanted to take charge, to...play the part of the hero for a change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Lost Blue is a city built by those who were abandoned by the world. People from all over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>You can't survive down here unless you turn a blind eye to the truth of your own existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Truth is, I was afraid. I didn't know how much longer I could keep going. So I acted out, like the brat I was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I thought I had to keep myself on edge to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>There are a lot of scary things down here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I don't even know where to start apologizing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I just kept vaguely hoping that, someday, someone would point me in the right direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I was stuck in a stalemate for so long, always waiting for things to change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Then, when I finally made it to Veda, I was terrified. I hesitated to take the power I'd been reaching for all that time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>And that's how I lost you the part of you that you treasured most.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>I stole it from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>It didn't matter what you said to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>It just made me dig my teeth in deeper.</td>
</tr>
