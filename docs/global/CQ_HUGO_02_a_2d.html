<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Was that a gunshot from inside the building?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wait! Where do you think you're going?! You were told to stand by! Don't go taking action on your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Shut up! I'm not gonna stand around and do nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Vivi can handle herself! Our job is to secure an escape route for her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You're not wrong. That's why you should stay here and do just that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm just a feeble, gunslinging mercenary-for-hire. You don't really need my help here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hey. Hey! That idiot, he really went in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Found her! There she is! Don't let her go near the armory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They somehow knew we were coming...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Urgh! Who...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hugo?! What are you doing?! Who said you can leave your post?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well you shouldn't have taken so long!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hey, don't go blaming this on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You think I'm just gonna stay put while we get further and further off schedule because one member of the team got into a gunfight all alone? Of course I'm gonna take some kind of initiative!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Don't you sling logic at me! You don't have the face of someone who can think logically! You scary, squint-eyed jerk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What kind of a face is that supposed to be?! What's with your fangs, anyway?! You trying to look like a wolf or something?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>They're not just some pair of dog fangs! My prominent, vampiric canines are one of my many charm points! Regardless, don't go selfishly acting on impulses and screwing up my plans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I mean, I know you're a compassionate person and all, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wh-what's with you all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh, please. I know you feign aggression to hide your social anxiety. It's really vexing, actually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm not as compassionate as you may think. It's no lie that I shot one of your comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I don't dislike you, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You've got a bad mouth on you, and you're definitely rude...but you're thoughtful, compassionate, and above all, competent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Quit saying that! I'm not a compassionate person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If you weren't, you wouldn't have come to help me. Why can't you just take that as truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Are you scared to accept your true colors?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You're such a meddler. I just... I don't look the part, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Dang it, look... We got too carried away with bickering and got ourselves surrounded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>There were way more armories here than expected. I did finish setting the bombs, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>They caught me just as I was getting to a safe distance to detonate from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Where exactly did you set the bombs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>There's one over there. That should set off the others, but its just out of range for my guns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I just had VIVI-dly cool idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Th-that's my thing! You can't say that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Can it. I was just quicker than you. Anyway, I can hit it from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Buy me some time. You can do that, can't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ha! Who do you think you're talking to?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Keep shooting! Keep them at a distance from the armory! Reinforcements are on their way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What's taking you so long?! You better not be taking a little tea break!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Don't rush me! It takes time to pour a proper cup of tea! Shut up and wait!</td>
