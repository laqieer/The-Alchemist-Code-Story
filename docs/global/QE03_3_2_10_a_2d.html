<td>Huff...huff...! Um...Alma? What is Belphegor?</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>You've guys have at least heard of it, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Some of the countries in Babel have their own Sacred Stone. Apparently, this country's Sacred Stone is called Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I've heard of that, but...what about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The Belphegor that Dias referred to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Apparently, it's the Sacred Stone that was hidden in Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's not even a rumor...that's government secrets! Where do you even get your information from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Anyway...so, the fact that Belphegor is in this country...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So it's true that a man entered from Slothstein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Salomo?</td>

<td>That country is a haven for mechanical engineering. I've heard they have flying machines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My guess is that the man was riding on a super-fast machine that was flying through the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Or else it would be impossible to break through this country's security.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>A super-fast machine that flies... Do you think it can fly above the clouds as well?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's the final hope left to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If the man was caught, shouldn't he be imprisoned in the royal palace?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Let's go back to the royal palace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We...we won't...let you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Whoa! I thought we just defeated you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We'll never let you back into the royal palace!</td>
