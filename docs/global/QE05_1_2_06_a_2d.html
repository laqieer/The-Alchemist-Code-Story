<td>There's...nothing left.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Not quite. Ashes and burned ruins remain. There is no question that this was once a village.</td>

<td>W-wait! Hisham, where are you going?</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>My house used to be here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Next to it was my best friend's house! The elders of the village were incredibly kind, and we all looked forward to the few times merchants would stop in the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Every day was a struggle, but everyone always took the time to laugh and enjoy life, too! And yet...</td>

<td>I-I know what these are! They are the monsters that do bad things in the desert at night!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We have to run! Whenever the villagers were attacked by these, they fell sick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Don't worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You could say that we're specialists in this field. We know how to purify these kinds of creatures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>The Jam cannot be taken down with normal weapons, but Spiritbonding is a whole different story!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Leave it to us, Hisham! We'll show you the true power of our village's warriors!</td>
