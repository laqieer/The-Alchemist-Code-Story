<td>I was curious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>About you... About the world we'd see together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I had fun walking in this closed-off world with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>They say curiosity killed the cat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If I was allowed to choose, I would have preferred curiosity to be what killed me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>There's nothing more we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Sorry to put you through this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I did what I could for Zwei. There was just enough time for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>She's pushing all of her senses to temporarily recover her stamina. She should be able to fight on for a short while longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>E-even for her final mission's sake... This... This is just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Don't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If you'll allow me... I can be there with her. I can take that beast of a man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Füry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This isn't for neglecting the presence of those who suffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Rather, this is to preserve their memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There is no such thing as absolute justice. So how could we possibly know what is right and what is wrong? All we can do, at least for our final wish—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Another member of our family is lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>They just don't want our help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm still the same hopeless little demon that I always was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>They told me everything. I don't mind if it's you who kills me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hehe. That won't do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Had I not taken you away from that facility, you would have lived for much longer, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This is much better than being killed in captivity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You gave me the freedom to die as I wish, Dead Nine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I won't have that freedom for much longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Kuro here is really something special.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>At the moment of my death, Kuro will break these chains and devour the one who holds them. That's how Kuro's been programmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's so that Kuro can continue fighting, even after the death of the host, and that time is near.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Why?! Why does it have to be like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I just have two requests, Dead Nine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I want you to go with Sol. You two are after the same goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's why I waited for you with Sol, after we made the Templars together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>For my other request...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I want you to fight me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It was a short life, but the only time I felt alive was when I was with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>All I learned from you was how to fight, though. That's all you knew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I can... I can teach you other things if you just stick with me! Not just fighting, but so many other things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The only freedom allowed to me, back when I was barely allowed to exist...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Was fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I can't believe those words anymore. I can only believe in those I see fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Those are my words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Believe in me. Remember how I fought... How I lived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Until I puke up another nine beers worth of blood, I don't need help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I came here for a fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I guess I can't help you anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>How dare you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You just disappear one day, then show up out of nowhere and expect me to listen to your requests?! You've got some nerve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You can't keep a cat from going out on her own. Meow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>D-did you just meow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Well...? Are we doing this, or what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That's enough talking for now. Let's just get to the fighting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yeah... I guess you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It's gonna be a brawl. You really want to do this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You know I've been rumored to be un-killable.</td>
</tr>
