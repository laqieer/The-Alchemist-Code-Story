<td>Agh! What weight, what speed in his attack! I can hold it back for now, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>There is not faltering his assault! It will not end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Aarrghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What? He bowed and walked away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh...he's making other people wear loincloths too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ack. No good... Something is missing! What is it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey... How about we read that book once again? Should I read it instead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's not for your eyes to see, Mielikki. Teona, can you do us the honors?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, okay! Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>He-here, I found it! It shows them praising each other's loincloths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Gormalas' strange movements just now...was that what he was doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Right. Praising each other's loincloths is the ritual! Dilga should perform the ritual as it's supposed to be! If we recreate this Festive Battle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Understood! Hmm, let me see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's this, Dilga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I see! The ancient tribes were quite stylish in their approach to matters! Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Dilga walks over to the west side of the beach and stands in the way of Gormalas who is terrorizing the tourists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The two of them catch each other's gaze and strange tension engulfs the beach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The two of them glare at each other. Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Gormalas...no...ancient warrior spirit! Let us commence the pre-ritual battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>How to write the letters for 'loincloth' with your bottom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You write it like this...and then this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh, Gormalas is making the same movement!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Nice! It's off to a good start!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>How do you write the next character for loincloth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Like this...then like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Whoooaaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Wow! He's doing it really fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Mielikki, don't look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...Fast buttocks art?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Amazing! What amazing movements!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That movement causes the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and the deeper muscles to undergo training...causing the loincloth to look even more attractive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I guess the loincloth really is meant to draw attention to the buttocks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh...they finished spelling out the final letter! They've finished the ritual of complimenting each other. Now the actual battle begins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Noooooohhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ooahhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It's started! The Festival Battle between the De tribe and the Go tribe that transcends time!</td>
