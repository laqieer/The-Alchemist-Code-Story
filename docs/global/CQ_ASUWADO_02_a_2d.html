<td>Also...yesterday, there seemed to be some kind of commotion. Do you know what happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>A commotion? I don't know anything about that. I doubt anything out of the ordinary happened. This neighborhood is a peaceful one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(I'd like to find out how yesterday's incident was handled, but...hm? Is that...?)</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hello, old man! Please give me an apple!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Always in such high spirits, aren't you, Kuon? Are you taking another night walk? I've heard there was a thief lurking around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Really?! A thief, not a wolf?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Well, I don't know if I should be telling you this, but yesterday someone died on that road. You be careful now, Kuon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's pretty scary. Thank you for worrying about me, but I'll be okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, well. You're as blissful as always, Kuon. Maybe that easygoing nature of yours will defang whatever venomous thief is out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(Why does he give her information so easily?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(My performance was flawless. The shopkeeper shouldn't have been suspicious. How did I do things differently?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh c'mon, old man! Huh? Who's that over there...oh! Aswald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, wait! Wait, pleeeease!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>And so...here you go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That old man gave it to me just now. It's a candy from a foreign country. It's real sweet and delicious. You try it too, Aswald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I've no need for it. Feel free to eat it on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh?! But it's so good...why? Oh! Don't tell me you don't like sweets!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's not that. I don't like to casually eat food that other people give to me. Who knows if it has poison in it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's fiiine! It's been fine until now. Besides, both you and that old man are good people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I am not a good person. If you keep trusting people the way you do, you'll eventually suffer for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But you're a good person, Aswald! After all, you saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>!!! You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hey, you lot! What do you think you're doing blissfully eating candy here?! If you value your lives, then hand over all your money!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>She's the only one who's blissful here. I'd prefer if you didn't put us in the same boat.</td>
