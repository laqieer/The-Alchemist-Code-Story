<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Another one down! How's it going over there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We've brought it to a draw! We are doing all we can to stand our ground!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Argh... Hang in there! Captain Othima, Captain Seida, and Captain Kagura should be back here soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Once the captains have returned, we will be able to flank the enemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Then we will be able to turn the tide! We just need to hold out until then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hmph. A draw. Well...until now, I would say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ack...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hahahahaha! We are the harbingers of your end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My, my. Long time no see, brat! I'm so delighted to see you that I am practically trembling...with excitement to wipe you out along with all the rest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No! Be wary, all, and do not engage that man in single combat! We must somehow endure until the captains return!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ah... Ignorance is bliss, isn't it? For you, not me. You're so pitiful you make me want to retch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ignorance...? What are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hahaha, so impatient! Are you sure you want to know? After all, it must be quite disheartening to find out that Othima and Seida will never come to help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And that...Kagura, was it? Unfortunately she won't be able to make it either. We may have...completely annihilated the lot of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>See? Isn't that sad? I basically just told you that you're standing on your own graves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>N-no... That's impossible! You're just lying to destroy our morale!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh, really? Sol seemed quite pleased to tell me about how they cried and begged as he tore them apart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hahahahahahaha! Welcome to reality, brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You...! Huzzaaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Captain Basheeny! Come, knights!</td>
