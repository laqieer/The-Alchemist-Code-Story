<td>Rat-Killer...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ughh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Finally, you're awake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wh-where is she?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You shouldn't get up. You were out for weeks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Weeks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You were at the Mystic Tower Veda, weren't you? The residual effects of being in another dimension muddied your consciousness. You shouldn't have been there for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Where's the kid that was with me? The therian kid! Where is she?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You should thank her. She carried you all the way here. You were far more injured than her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I asked you where is she now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Not a clue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What the hell does that mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>She disappeared a little while ago. She didn't say where she was going. You know how cats can be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>She...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tch! My body feels so frail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well, like I said, you've been lying there for weeks. Of course your body will go numb. Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This might help make up for your reduced muscle mass. Just a bit, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But seriously... Fighting your way to the hundredth floor of Veda, then jumping out the side; and this is the extent of your injuries?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Two horns... Red skin... You look like a—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Something's different... Lost Blue just isn't the same, somehow.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Did you hear? He came back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The kid went beyond the hundred and first floor of Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>He apparently gained some weird new powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's said that nobody can stand up against him anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Finally, he has returned. The hero Lost Blue has been waiting for. The one who will bring us light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The one who will become our Sun in this sky-less land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It must be him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Dead Nine has been replaced. He's no longer our king or our law.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Don't look at me like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I figured you'd be alive. I haven't seen you in a while, so I was starting to get worried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Nice seat you got there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Isn't it? One of the corrupt authorities studying Mystic Tower Veda gave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Please. Won't you be our Sun? he says.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You're not bright enough to be the sunny type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Aww, you don't think this smile is bright and shiny enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Not when I can see a dark side to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>So I take it you gained the Alchemy Source or whatever?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>No, the tower requires much more Alchemia to reach the top.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>But there was a little something that helped me get past the hundred and first floor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What?! How?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Uhmmm... My undeniable charm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Quit joking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>[Mystic Tower Veda Fringe Dimension]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Beyond the hundred and first floor was literally another dimension.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Immersing myself in the topological space of the other dimension, I felt like I was being remade from the inside out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Before I knew it, I had some odd new power conceived within me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Though I had to pay a price for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>A price?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It's still not enough. The road to world domination is a long one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I want you to walk it with me, Dead Nine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Heh, you know what you have to do if you want me to follow you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Now don't be like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I don't even feel fear anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's what scares me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Mmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Violence isn't always the answer, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>(I'm scared...but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I can never lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>For us unwanted outcasts to survive...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>We have to change this world entirely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>With the fire of violence, I will boil out the indolent masses that turn a blind eye to the injustice of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>And to do so—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>—we need rules.</td>
</tr>
