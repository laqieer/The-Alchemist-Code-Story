<tr>

<td>Ughh!</td>

<tr>
<td>Back-Alley Doctor</td>
<td>Finally, you're awake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Wh-where is she?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Back-Alley Doctor</td>
<td>You shouldn't get up. You were out for weeks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Weeks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Back-Alley Doctor</td>
<td>You were at the Mystic Tower Veda, weren't you? The residual effects of being in another dimension muddied your consciousness. You shouldn't have been there for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Where's the kid that was with me? The therian kid! Where is she?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Back-Alley Doctor</td>
<td>You should thank her. She carried you all the way here. You were far more injured than her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>I asked you where is she now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Back-Alley Doctor</td>
<td>Not a clue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>What the hell does that mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Back-Alley Doctor</td>
<td>She disappeared a little while ago. She didn't say where she was going. You know how cats can be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>She...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Tch! My body feels so frail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Back-Alley Doctor</td>
<td>Well, like I said, you've been lying there for weeks. Of course your body will go numb. Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Back-Alley Doctor</td>
<td>This might help make up for your reduced muscle mass. Just a bit, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Back-Alley Doctor</td>
<td>But seriously... Fighting your way to the hundredth floor of Veda, then jumping out the side; and this is the extent of your injuries?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Back-Alley Doctor</td>
<td>Two horns... Red skin... You look like a—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>(Something's different... Lost Blue just isn't the same, somehow.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Did you hear? He came back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>The kid went beyond the hundred and first floor of Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>He apparently gained some weird new powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>It's said that nobody can stand up against him anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Finally, he has returned. The hero Lost Blue has been waiting for. The one who will bring us light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>The one who will become our Sun in this sky-less land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>It must be him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Dead Nine has been replaced. He's no longer our king or our law.</td>

<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>I figured you'd be alive. I haven't seen you in a while, so I was starting to get worried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Nice seat you got there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Isn't it? One of the corrupt authorities studying Mystic Tower Veda gave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Please. Won't you be our Sun? he says.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>You're not bright enough to be the sunny type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Aww, you don't think this smile is bright and shiny enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Not when I can see a dark side to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>So I take it you gained the Alchemy Source or whatever?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>No, the tower requires much more Alchemia to reach the top.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>But there was a little something that helped me get past the hundred and first floor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>What?! How?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Uhmmm... My undeniable charm?</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>Immersing myself in the topological space of the other dimension, I felt like I was being remade from the inside out.</td>

<tr>

<td>A price?</td>

<td>It's still not enough. The road to world domination is a long one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I want you to walk it with me, Dead Nine.</td>

<td>Heh, you know what you have to do if you want me to follow you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Now don't be like that.</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>That's what scares me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>For us unwanted outcasts to survive...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nihil</td>
<td>We have to change this world entirely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>With the fire of violence, I will boil out the indolent masses that turn a blind eye to the injustice of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>And to do so—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine - Nihil</td>
<td>—we need rules.</td>
