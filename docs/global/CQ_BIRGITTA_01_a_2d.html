<td>001</td>
<td>This way, Madam Soothsayer. You must be exhausted from your long journey. Please, rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Quite the change in attitude now that you know who I am. What is it you want from me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Very perceptive, Madam Soothsayer. I should have expected nothing less. You see, our village has been plagued by wild beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I see, so you want me to rid your village of these beasts. That isn't too unreasonable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What is with all that ruckus, though? Is there some traveling merchant in town?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If you can call that peddler a merchant, then sure. She arrived moments before you did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wow! You have so many shiny things, lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>These are for my work, but I can give you these glass ones if you like. See? Aren't they just as pretty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You will?! Oh, wow! They're so shiny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No fair! I want some!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hahaha! No need to fight. There's plenty more where that came from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, hello. Aren't you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I... I-I'm wearing clothes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, of course you are! If you were still wandering around naked after everything I said, I would have wrapped you up like a mummy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Please, no. I couldn't stand another one of your lectures. Besides, I just didn't know what constituted good manners back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's not really a question of manners...more so a kind of social norm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>W-well, as you can see, I've been traveling around other countries and have learned much. I can now interact with anyone without a problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Heheh, how funny! I didn't expect you two to know each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'd say we know each other pretty well. After all, when we first met, I saw more of her than I bargained for...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Anyway! Weren't you telling me about some beasts that you need me to take care of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh, yes. There is a mine near the village. They seem to be coming from there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>A mine, huh? Any idea what caused this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Um, you see... Well, I... All I can say for sure is that many gems can be found around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ah... Well now I see why you're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The best discoveries in life are the ones you make yourself! Besides, now that I know there are problems in the area, I can't just ignore that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>And you always personally come out this far, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm not here to kill time. Whenever there's a problem, I just want to do what I can to investigate and help out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, I'll be taking care of the beasts myself, so you can just sit back and stay out of my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I think not. Exterminating the beasts won't solve the core of the problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What do you mean it won't solve the problem? Why are you so invested in this, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Unless we solve the root cause, beasts may simply start harassing the village again once we leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You worry too much. Getting too involved with other people's problems doesn't usually end well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You have to remember that we're outsiders. We shouldn't give them too much hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You've become quite the pessimist. Did something happen in Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Nothing important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's just that I witnessed a lot of things happen in Saga. I've decided to be a little more...careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>B-beasts! Help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We can talk later, Mirianne. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
