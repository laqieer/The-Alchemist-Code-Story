<td>Rise up, my brethren.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>*Gasp*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This…must be a memory of the king in his final moments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>When the rains of fire and corruption were descending upon our homeland--destroying everything--he said:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You all are my greatest pride. I wish only for your prosperity. Therefore--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Live, young one. Leave my corpse behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Now, run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I, King Arias of the Ira Belt, shall clear your path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I ran without looking back. What he did--his sacrifice--was the beginning of the end for our land…yet I had no idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>And then--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…I see. So, my brother is dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If that's the case, then you must carry his sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…At that time--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I couldn't comprehend the weight--the significance--of the sword that was entrusted to me…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What's the meaning of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Our reports indicate that fiery corruption is spewing from the great mountain in the distance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The shield regimen is doing its best, but if we stay any longer we risk being corrupted…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Tch…This must be what Andechs meant by "the night of fire rain."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>All soldiers withdraw to the borderlands! If we turn into Fallen here, Nimul's party will be in dire straits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Abandon your tents and personal effects. We have no time to spare!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>To think the Ira Belt would succumb to this level of calamity...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>As an Invidian, I can't forgive them for dragging my people into the war…but they deserve better than this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Imnus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Nicaea, you must have heard. We're retreating to the borderlands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I worry we'll be too far from Nimul's party, but knowing Daphne is with them puts my mind at ease.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There may be other reasons to worry. Look! Do you see that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What on earth--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...I don't believe it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The Ira Belt is sending its knights in full force our way!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…Are we safe from the corruption in here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>For now, at least, the power of the Red Blade will protect us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Is that sword altering the magil in the atmosphere…or returning it to normal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm surprised such a thing exists given the sparse technology of this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>…They say the king's family originated from outside the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>They were Red Blade-wielders and were able to cultivate the land, even if just a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That explains how they became kings. You've gotta be able to feed the people in order to rule them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>…Who knows, but you may be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>At any rate, what now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What indeed… Outside it's a veritable sea of fire. If we're to pursue Quence to Mt. Shinai, we'll have to rely on--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>My silver shield's protection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Exactly. But we'll likely have to confront Satna along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The only way to defend against flame incarnate is with that shield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But we don't want to exhaust our only defense either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>So, whadda we do? It's not like we have an airship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Looks like there's only one option--hoof it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I bet we could have the Engineer Soldiers form a protective barrier, or something…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>See, like this… We can have them make a roof with their arms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I see...but that would leave us open to attack from the sides… There must be another way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>If we stand any chance of reversing this calamity, we've got to hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hark, the death knell tolls. Writhe in the flames of my wrath, humans!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...The castle gates have been breached.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>We've got to make it through this--no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Everyone, focus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>First, eliminate the obstacles in front of you! "I am Transcender of the Gate of Envy!"</td>
