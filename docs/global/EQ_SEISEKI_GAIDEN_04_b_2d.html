<td>Their fighting style resembles that of the Shadow Messiah survivors in Envylia. I thought as much. I'm glad that I was paying attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>She's so strong...and that insight...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>She's not even trying, though! This is what it means to be a Captain! I still have much to learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yet...for there to be such a difference in power between us...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No, it's just my Alchemia Pura. I'm sure you will both come to surpass me. I really believe that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You are strong, but opponents outside of the Holy Guard will use more than brute force against you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Now that you are a Captain, Kudan, you need to focus on the bigger picture, not only on taking down the enemy in front of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What am I saying? It isn't like me to lecture...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes, Captain. I am still weak. I need to become stronger, both as Captain and as an individual!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Stop. Kudan, strength isn't everything. That's what I meant by straightforwardness being dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I really hope that you don't stray down the wrong path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's all right. Kudan would never do such a thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>And in the unlikely event that he did stray down the wrong path, I am sure that I would be there to pull him back from it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hmmm... If you are by his side, Kagura, then I suppose it will be fine. Do you agree, Kudanstein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes...of course. I need power only so that I can protect Kagura and this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There is no reason for me to stray from that path!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>A good answer. You have a good Captain here, Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You must be tired. I'm sorry for keeping you. You may go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then we shall take our leave. Please take care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>They have a good bond. Yes... It's time for me to step down as Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I... What am I doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What's the matter, Zain? You're here to accompany me on my research, are you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I am, but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Then we should get going, too. We need to reach the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's why we're here, so we shouldn't waste time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Mmm...</td>
