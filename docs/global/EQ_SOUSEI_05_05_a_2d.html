<td>There's a civil war in the Ira Belt?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Exactly. Eh, I say civil war, but it's not as dangerous as it sounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>It's more of a difference of opinion regarding what direction we should steer the country towards.</td>
</tr>

<td>Hm... That's right, they said something about you being the pacifist faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Our faction has a bit of a different take on the recent unusual incident. We believe it'd be better to peacefully investigate, rather than engage in this war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>And the king I've sworn allegiance to, King Arius, agrees with this assessment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I suppose I should start by telling you a little more about the place I'm from.</td>

<td colspan="2"><img src="../img/backgrounds/bg02.png" alt="bg02"></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>The Ira Belt is a kingdom of mountain ranges and wastelands. Historically, we've always had few resources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Still, we have always been a peaceful folk, loath to spill blood, and we shared what little food we had with each other, and everyday we just prayed to live another day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><img src="../img/backgrounds/bg204.png" alt="bg204"></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>That all changed when the Satna reawakened. Our people had to scramble and fight amongst one another to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Our dwindling population had to fight over our already scarce resources. We were facing our own demise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>But the king rose to stop such a tragedy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>He formed the knights, banned the citizens from fighting one another, and once more united the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>That was our generous King Arius, the one who leads our lands...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>The king told me this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>"This sudden connection with the Invidia Belt is a wonderful thing, a new chance at survival. Let's hope that they'll agree to an alliance."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I covertly travelled to this country in order to relay his wishes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Why did you have to travel in secret?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I fear that our country is not so united in its wishes. There are some dangerous fellows among us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>The type that will take whatever they want. Well, to be fair, our country had a lot of those before King Arius took over too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>We thought they'd behave if we secured an alliance between us and the king of Invidia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>...But instead they came to murder our citizens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I fear that you're correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>King Arius must have been removed from his seat of power, which means that the Ira Belt is now in the hands of another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>It may be his sister, Princess Terese.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>So you're saying she must've kicked him off the throne and seized power while you were gone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Yes, but that doesn't mean I've given up on securing this alliance. Obtaining it is more vital now than ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>Why's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Do I need to explain? The fact that our borders are touching all of the sudden is an abnormality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Something strange is happening to this world. Things we've always taken for granted are changing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>It's ridiculous for us humans to fight among each other in a situation like this. Now, of all times, is when we should unite and work together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>...Your words seem reasonable, but yet—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>You still won't believe me? Hm, I guess can't be helped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>My country did just invade yours after all. I understand your hesitation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>But I fear I cannot plead my cause any further than this, so please, believe me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>What do you think, Your Highness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>A good question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>If you truly wish to form an alliance, we'd be happy to oblige.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>But there remains one big problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>King Arius no longer rules over the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>And an alliance is a pact made between leaders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>We can wish for peace all we want, but it'll mean nothing if the other side doesn't agree to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Andechs, any thoughts on that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>...Teres used to criticize the king's ideals as if they were little more than childish dreams. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eula.png" alt="Eulalia" height="128"><br>Eulalia</td>
<td>She wasn't nearly as extreme as she is now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Yes. I can only tell you what I know, but there was a certain other factor that caught my interest... A certain...serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>That can only be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I think they called themselves something like the Infinite Serpent? One day a man who called himself part of the Infinite Serpent appeared within our borders. Before we knew it, he slithered his way into the position of the princess' counsellor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I had some suspicions, but the princess is a smart cookie. I thought I was simply overthinking it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>So he manipulated her then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_niku.png" alt="Nyx" height="128"><br>Nyx</td>
<td>We can't know that for sure, though. Maybe they just happened to get along and became fast friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Then I fear I'll have to get my hands dirty. I'll kill the princess and that serpent myself if that's the only way to stop this chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>Are you serious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>This invasion was a step too far. There's no justice or honor in their actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Most regular wars are a tragedy. A war without justice is mere cruelty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>As long as discipline regulates the battlefield, a fair war can be fought, no matter who has the upper hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>But when both parties antagonize each other so deeply that they won't even acknowledge the time to retreat? Then it's all over. War becomes nothing more than an quagmire that swallows everything whole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I don't want to keep seeing that kind of tragedy. If it seems like it'll come to a war like that again, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I will do whatever is necessary to stop it, even if it makes everyone despise me. That's what justice means to me.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/daph.png" alt="Daphne" height="128"><br>Daphne</td>
<td>(I could never do such a thing... Sticking so firmly to my beliefs that I could betray the world I grew up in?)</td>
</tr>

<td>(My resolve just isn't strong enough...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/daph.png" alt="Daphne" height="128"><br>Daphne</td>

</tr>

<td>It doesn't seem like he's lying, but...it also doesn't seem wise to trust him completely.</td>
</tr>

<td>So you believe he could still be a spy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>

<td>Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Imnus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>My apologies, it's nothing. I was just thinking about how all our visitors are so terribly kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>Of course, I'd love to avoid the unnecessary spilling of blood. Forming a treaty like he said would absolutely be the best outcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>But the way things are now, all we can do is defend ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>Of course, and we're grateful for your aid. I'd like to start by requesting more information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Not just about those serpents, but about the other things we don't know. Such as abilities you possess, tactics you know about...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>I wish to know all of it, so we can prepare for the unexpected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>This is why I'm not asking you to strengthen our dwindling front lines. For the time being, I want you to lend us your knowledge so we may strengthen our city.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>I plan to leave any strategizing and counter-measures regarding the Ira Knight's equipment to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>Thank you. Whatever they used to cloak and hide themselves is a big threat to us in particular.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>The fact that they made it to our ports unnoticed means they didn't just turn their soldiers invisible, but their ships too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>If we could destroy that mechanism, we could eliminate them in a sea battle before they got too close.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
