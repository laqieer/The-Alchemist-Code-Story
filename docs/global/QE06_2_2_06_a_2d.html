<td>002</td>
<td>Um…mind if I show you something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Before we eat, we say, "Let's give thanks for this food." When we're finished we say, "Thank you for the meal!" That's how we show respect to the life we take!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>... Ah, but demons don't have any customs like that…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A meal doesn't care whether you're a human or a demon. Go on, try saying it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…ThAnK yOu FoR tHe MeAl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Fantastic! That shows you appreciate the life your meal provides. It's important to show respect, y'know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…Isn't the act of eating a form of respect in itself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Not at all. Demons eat humans all the time, but you don't show us any respect. That's why you're treated like bad guys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Will that change if we eat you with gratitude?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hm? Ummmmmm... Probably not. Well, forget about that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Don't dodge my question!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Verbalizing gratitude to those connected to your life... That's what's important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>When we give thanks for our meals, it's because we are taking life. You see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…I don't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Then, I'll whop you every time you forget to give thanks. You better watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>… Er, alright…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So how was it? Was it delicious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>…I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Damn it! Still?…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's only my second time. Don't be too hard on yourself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I can't help it! I want you to shout, "Delicious!" Hmm…what more does it need?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's fine, really…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's not good enough! I want to make meals that will change your life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…If that's the case, you've already succeeded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>…I have…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…Ever since…that time...I couldn't eat anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>As a result...my brother carries a burden that he shouldn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>He thinks it's his fault you can't eat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...Yes. So…even if it was by chance, I wound up here and learned to eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I have to change. I have to be stronger. To relieve my brother's of his burden...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I don't want to be protected… That thought made me come here again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Do you think you've changed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>…Not in the way that I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmm…I guess you can't eat whatever I give you…yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>…For such an idiot, you put a lot of thought into cooking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Of course! I won't be able to realize my dream unless I take the time to think it through. I'm well aware of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...What a strange man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So, what are you gonna do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>…I'm not sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Not sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Of course not! Gimme a break! Even you admitted I probably can't…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Besides, I haven't ruled out eating you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>… !! Hang on! That's it! I think I've got it--I'm a genius!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>…What? Did you realize something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It turns out...I need to make your heart say, "It's delicious!" before your lips do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I know what I gotta do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>…I'm not following.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>And if I can get you to say "It's delicious!" I'm sure your big brother will too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Imagine how many problems would be solved if we all had great food! There'd be a smile on everyone's face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You think it's that easy--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'll cook up something so finger-lickin' good, humans will look like chopped liver by comparison. That'll put an end to the conflict! Piece. Of. Cake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Sometimes I amaze myself! All we need to bring peace to Wadatsumi is some good old-fashioned cooking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But...the demons have always devoured people. You can't expect to change that overnight…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Us humans--especially folks like me--have killed demons and caused you immense suffering. What's important now is to look to the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>But…how do you expect humans and demons to understand one another?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Look at us! We seem to be on the same page, right? So it must be possible. Don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…Same page? We're not even in the same book!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>But you're not thinking about devouring me anymore, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I told you I haven't ruled it out…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If we understand each other, we can live side by side. We'll no longer need to fight! Cooking will transform Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>…It sounds too good to be true…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It's all about good food, baby!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>…Pff. Haha…Bwahaha! You really are nuts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>As long as we can laugh together, call me what you want. Of course, I have no way of knowing whether my plan will work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>But…sometimes you gotta be a little crazy to take a chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>…Yeah, you might be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>…Ready for seconds?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>…Sure, I'll have some more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That's not what we say!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Oh, um… "Seconds, please?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Attagirl!</td>
