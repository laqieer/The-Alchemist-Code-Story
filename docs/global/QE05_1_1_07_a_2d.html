<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I am Ceclidis, General of the Third Legion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>My apologies. My name is Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hrm. Never heard of you. Judging from your garb, you are from one of the southern tribes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(He seems suspicious. Does he believe I might be a spy for the rebel forces? Then...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I once called that place my home, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But no longer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Indeed. Now, I am a mere wanderer, plying divination as my trade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>A fortune-teller, huh? You're not planting foolish thoughts into the king's head, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I am not sure what you may be implying, but I did indeed divine the answers to some questions the King had.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Of course, of course. We are in trying times. I can see why the King might seek solutions in omens and conjurations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So? What did he ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Forgive me, sir...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You cannot tell me? I must say, this only makes me suspicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Are you interested in having your fortune told, Ceclidis? In that case, I may be able to humor you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Who...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You! When did you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(He got this close without my noticing?! Who is this man?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I apologize for startling you. I could not help but interject.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I am Waginau. I command the scouting legion of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The Holy Guard?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Lord Waginau, how may I be of assistance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No, no. I simply found it rather peculiar to hear the general of the Gluttony Army's Third Legion seemingly interested in fortune-telling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I am certainly no expert, but I thought I might lend my meager abilities to satisfy your curiosity in the matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What exactly do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We are simple scouts. We don't have any particular expectations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Or do you know of some affair that may require our attention, General Ceclidis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hmph. Your humor leaves a lot to be desired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If it will not leave you too bereft, may I borrow this man for a while?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Me, sir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>As I suspected. You hail from the same village as I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I would be much obliged if you would tell me stories of my old home. I recently find myself missing it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If you wish, gladly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Unless you take issue, General?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh, no. I apologize for keeping you. Please, by all means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Thank you. Excuse me, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hmph. Divination, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>There is no way that straight-laced king of ours would rely on such parlor tricks to make decisions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Who was that man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Interested? Shall we lend you one of ours to tail him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No, we have more important things to worry about. First, we must locate the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I suppose this is as good a place as any.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No need to feel so threatened. I do have something I wish to discuss with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I appreciate you getting me out of that situation, but the Holy Guard maintains the balance of this continent's Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What would a member of such an organization have to discuss with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I was speaking truthfully earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I could not neglect one from the same village I came from in their time of need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Perhaps you will understand me better if I show you this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That symbol on your neck is...a sephirah?! The mark of wisdom found only on our people! Then you are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I left home a long time ago. Since then, I have joined the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I am acquainted with the current village chief, Iakov. Perhaps you could try to trust me a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Even if that is true, what is the Holy Guard doing in Gluttony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The Holy Guard's presence here during a civil war is tantamount to adding fuel to a fire. What business do you have here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Well, well. You are shrewder than I had expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>There is a possibility that Alchemy may have been abused here. The Holy Guard is here to verify that suspicion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What?! If that is true...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>We are not yet sure. That is why I have come here with my legion to investigate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>We are taking every precaution not to disturb Gluttony's current state of affairs, for example, by bringing only the minimum required number of men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Unfortunately, as you well know, for investigation and nothing more, having foreigners snooping around may agitate this country's situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That is why I have decided to hire a bodyguard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>In particular, my mind would be put at ease if it were someone from my hometown watching my back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Besides, the well-being of that child with you at the Arena seems to weigh heavily on your mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You were watching that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Of course. It would have been a waste to miss such a wonderful display of skill, on par with any veteran gladiator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>That fight in the Arena is another reason I decided to ask you for this favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It is highly unusual for a Sephira leaving the village on official business to bring a child along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I can only assume you found him somewhere on the course of your journey here. While your intentions are admirable, you haven't any plan for him, have you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>If you take this job, we would be happy to take him into our care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I believe the Holy Guard would be of some assistance in finding the child's family. Would you not agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I am sorry, but...I am not in any position to make such a deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Why is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>As you know, I am here on official business from Chief Iakov.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Even if you were born a Sephira, you now belong to the outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I cannot lend my strength to an outside organization of my own accord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I also cannot simply leave that child in your care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It is not impossible that you are plotting to manipulate me into doing something I would rather not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>If that is the case, I cannot allow the risk of that child being used as hostage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ah... It seems that in attempting to sweeten the deal, I have invited your suspicion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Then I must show you some of my cards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Specifically, there may be an opportunity for you to find the source of your Sacred Stone problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>There was some kind of large-scale movement of Alchemia somewhere in southern Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>The Holy Guard sent us to investigate that unusual event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Are you saying Sephiron may be—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>That is part of what I am here to investigate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Chief Iakov is aware of the urgency of this matter, though we do not have the time to wait for you to confirm the matter with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>You must believe me when I say that I do all this in the name of "absolute justice"—and for the sake of peace on this continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I see you are indeed pressed for time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Still, I will give you what time I can to think about it. If you wish to take the job, meet me at the West Gate of the royal capital tomorrow morning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>So, Hisham, are you interested in becoming a gladiator?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Becoming a...? I think it's cool, but I don't think I could ever do anything like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>You're too young to be so pessimistic! You definitely can if you train!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Ooh, I know! What do you think about coming to see the training school?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>There are a lot of students who go there, so you might find someone from the same place as you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Mmm, but I—oh, hey! Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Welcome back. Did you finish your errands, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Hisham, it seems our time together ends here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>What do you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I was hired as a guide for the Holy Guard. I will be leaving the royal capital as early as tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>It will be a dangerous journey, not suitable for a child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Teona, I know this is asking a lot, but do you know of anybody who would be able to take Hisham in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I think the training school may be able to help, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>N-no! I don't want to be left behind, Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Hisham...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I-I know I'd just be a burden, b-but please don't go without me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Do not treat your own life so cheaply!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>You survived until now to come to Eos so you could find your family, did you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Y-yeah, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Then...I will be Hisham's protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>What? We may be heading straight into the fray of battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Did you forget? My whole purpose here is to challenge you to another fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>If I lose sight of you here, who knows if we will ever cross paths again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Besides, I already promised Hisham that I'd help him uncover his memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Thank you, Miss Teona!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>You, of all people, know my strength, Kamui. There shouldn't be any problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Fine. Do as you like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>It is time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>We will head first to the harbor city to the West. Everybody keep up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Why the harbor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Do you know what the largest industry is for this country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I dunno.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Mercenaries, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I've heard that mercenaries from Gluttony are making a name for themselves in the Desert Lands and Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Close, but no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>International trade. Goods from the desert, Saga, and Slothstein are traded overseas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Of course, mercenaries are among those "goods".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>So the wealth of this country is concentrated in the harbors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Exactly. A perfect place to gather intel on this country's state of affairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I had no idea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>I've heard that the maritime trade here is strictly under the control of the government.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>It's no wonder civilians would not be familiar with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Lord Waginau, are we going to follow this road straight out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>That's the plan. This road connecting the royal capital to its harbors has been well maintained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>It may be risky, but it's the quickest route.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Um, risky?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Like Kamui mentioned earlier, the harbor is this country's heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>So the rebel forces will naturally want to move to occupy this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>I see. That was why you were looking for bodyguards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Right. As representatives of justice, we cannot run or hide, no matter how outnumbered we may be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Which means—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>There they are! Like the intel said, it's the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>It is for situations like these that we need your help.</td>
</tr>
