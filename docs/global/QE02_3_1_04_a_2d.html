<td>So, in other words, you're fighting against the Beckrams to see who finds the Sacred Stone Belphegor first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yeah. That's the reason why the Guard Droids penetrated your mansion, Don.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What nonsense. Is that the reason why the young lady is being placed in danger?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If something were to happen to her, I'll use this 20 years worth of energy in my right arm to blow your head off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hmph. Don't act like you aren't responsible as well. You also kidnapped the little lady...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Don't put me in the same boat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I abducted the young lady out of moral obligation, not for some idiotic reason like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Moral obligation...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I took the young lady into my custody as a way to repay her old man, Mayor Edward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Not that that's something a selfish idiot like you could understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>As a way to repay Mayor Edward? That's the same as Edgar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ronnie... What do you mean by that? Wasn't the mayor a source of conflict to you, the mafia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Honestly...how short-sighted are you? Men don't have to be on the same side for them to understand each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That man gave me a former-mercenary like me a place to belong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>A place to belong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The Heaven district, where you live as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Despised as traitors, we had no place to go. That's the place we ultimately ended up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The Heaven district, where you live as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That being said, because of the landscape of the time, we were almost driven out of that land as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The landscape of the time...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This was all occurring right after the Dawn of Wrath, when Wratharis was destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>At the time, it was common practice to crack down on any troublemakers...and so the government also began to crack down on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>And Mayor Edward saved you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yep. He said that we were a necessary evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Heheh. He convinced them by saying that if we were unleashed into the world, it would no longer be safe to walk outside. That brought me a lot of pleasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So your actions are based on repaying an old debt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Exactly. It's not for some cheap reason like you lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Tango, the dolls are approaching from the front. Hurry up and scatter them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>They're Gu-Guard Droids! Edgar!</td>
</tr>
