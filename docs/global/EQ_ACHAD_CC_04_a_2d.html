<td>Looking back on it now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>She probably hated me, but she protected me even so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That's why I could withstand any complaint she could throw at me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If I could reach for her hand now, I would hold on tight and never let go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Will you shuffle the tarot cards for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm not good at offering words of consolation. They tend to turn into curses when I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Good. Now place the cards down here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Are you afraid to hear the result?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Didn't you lose your capacity for fear in exchange for power from the other dimension? No?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Your card is Death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>When drawn in the upright position, it signifies bad endings and dead bodies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I do wonder what became of her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Amu, I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sol?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Being left behind made me feel lonely, and always being on the receiving end of kindness made me feel pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The leader of the Templars. The sun of Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Compared to him, I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>In the end, all I ever did was make you feel indebted to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm just dead weight, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>All you ever do is stare longingly after the things you've lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I obsess over my mistakes, and work stubbornly to undo them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>In doing so, I believed I could get back the things I'd lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But I just ended up sinking my teeth into you, deeper and deeper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's why I drank blood from corpses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The only thing my hands were good for was adding more corpses to the pile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You'd always come running for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But I was afraid of looking you in the eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Your smile was so warm, it made my stomach hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>All I ever do is take up space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh my, what a blessed reunion! The stars must be watching over us today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Does my presence enrage you? Sadden you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm just here to have a little peek backstage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Wh-what are you planning?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You never change, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Even with your eye plucked out and your arms torn off, you still can't speak your mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Th-that's not true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You're still just another person's leftovers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What difference is there between thoughtless devotion and being kept as livestock?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>G-give it back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Surely there's something more important to you than this old thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Aaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Can't think of what it is? Go on. Try and remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Me, of course! Don't you need me, Mama?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'm more important to you than that girl, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Y-you mean...B-Bianca?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Care for me instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Give them back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Give me back Bianca! Give me back my eye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hmm, no can do. Not...yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Is that all you can do? Scream? Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You've grown weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Bang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Oho!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Sol!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'm here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The king! The king has arrived! Yes! Haha! All hail the king!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Sol, I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>S-Sol...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What's "fine"? Is weakness "fine"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>She's fine, just the way she is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Sol!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>How pitiable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>S-Sol!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Amu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Follow me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Oho! Smooth, my liege, very smooth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Kuro, did you know that cats tend to wander off on their own shortly before they die?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Why do you think that is? I always assumed it was because they didn't want their owners to have to witness their final moments, but apparently that isn't the case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>At least, not according to one theory. Some say it's simply because they grow weak, so they seek out a place of refuge, where they won't have to defend themself from harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>If that's true, then it's not like they want to get away from the people who love them. They just grow so weak, they forget themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I meant what I said. About being jealous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>When you're born in Lost Blue, from the moment you can walk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You have to constantly fight to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>And you're good at that, because you're strong. Really, really strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>After all, not being able to do things as well as you used to is very painful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>That's why it was hard for me to talk to you about how you felt, after...after you lost what you did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I mean, I benefited from it, didn't I? Everything changed for me overnight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>But if your arms are to be my strength, then that leaves my hands free to pick a fight with the rest of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I'm not afraid of anything anymore. If that makes me a madman, then so be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I will become the sun that Lost Blue needs, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Sol!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Bianca always told me not to worry, that my teeth didn't hurt her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>If you don't want to fight, then I'll provide a bed for you to rest in. If you don't want to stay, that's fine too. You're always free to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>She always told me that it hurt her more to see me upset.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I mean, I'd get it. No one with any sense would want to stay in this mad place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Still, it wasn't all sad for me. Dead Nine gave me a purpose. That was my happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>So, what do you think? I want you to tell me what you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I was the same way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Sol, you gave me a way forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Amu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>I couldn't suppress my emotions towards you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Is hell to be our stage, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Aren't you just being forced to fight again, Amu? Isn't he just another master, forcing you into the ring?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Is there really any difference between nurturing someone and being consumed by them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>"Devotion" does have a nice ring to it, but isn't it just another word for "dependence" or "obsession"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>You know what? I'm sick to death of listening to your monologues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Regrettably, they're all I'm good at. I've never had the pleasure of acting alongside anyone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Let me guess, you want me to be your costar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Oh, no, Sol. I simply want to witness more of your noble tyranny in action!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>I want you to express yourself through the madness of another massacre! To keep extorting your vassals for every last drop of wealth they have! Then, at the end of the play, I want to see you hang your head in shame, and pretend to lament your misdeeds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Only humans are capable of such malicious intent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>I won't deny it. I've always been despicable trash.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>That's why she always looks so dejected, isn't it? But such a stagnant expression isn't fit for the stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>If only she would look more like my mama! Oh, how I would love to go see a play with my mama! That's why I'm here, you know. To see your play!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I can't give you the thrills you're looking for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Tsk, tsk. Is that any way to treat your loyal audience?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Don't worry. I can make it work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>It's time for a costume change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Oh? What's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Do you know how to read tarot cards?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Enjoy the show.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Look at the clocktower!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>The meaning of a card differs depending on whether it is revealed in an upright or reversed position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>For instance, when the Death card is reversed, it signifies a pause or lull in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>It's stopped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>It also signifies ascension and rebirth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Didn't you know? I keep my secret weapon hidden underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I don't mind what you call me. I might be dependent, or obsessed. But that's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Where is that voice coming from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Hell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>All I want...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Well, well, well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>What a show!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Is to be able to share all my meals with Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Haha! Ahahahahahaha! This is what you had up your sleeve?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>The foremost authorities in magical engineering are extremely invested in the creation of humanoid weapons. They were pretty keen to request some...under-the-table research data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>How many weapons did you strap to that thing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>It took a huge chunk out of my savings, but I'd say the purchase was worth every cent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Now this...! This is really something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>I'm just happy to do what I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Aha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>When I was a slave, working hard was the only thing I was free to do. In other words, I was free to grow as strong as I could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Sol is the one who showed me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>He took my hands in his. He pulled me to my feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>And you're fine with throwing away your humanity, are you?! You would become a weapon for him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>How can you claim to be working hard if you're just relying on machinery?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>It takes strength to wield a weapon. To make its power your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Hah! Sounds like a last-ditch effort to make her useful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Things might not be perfect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>But we'll make up for that through hard work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Oh, if only mama could see this! My flesh and blood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>This... This isn't fair! But now I'm really excited! My blood is boiling, but I can't wait to see what happens next!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>This is what you call a deus ex machina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Are you ready, Am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>I'll follow you to world's end, Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>This is yours to use, but I'll make sure you never run out of ammo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Arms Storage! READY!</td>
</tr>
