<td>In this frozen time, there are none to hear the sounds of chilled wind, the snow crunching underfoot, or the screams.</td>

<td>Unable to scream, they will but lie there as their eyeballs are gouged out and chewed up.</td>

<td>Please...stop...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The sound of crunching bones, of innards being ripped out... Of flesh chewed and blood sucked out...</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Please! Stop! I don't want to hear it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>"Yet the sinners would be transformed by the blood, Alchemia, and souls of the high elves they killed, marking their bodies with the evil deed they had done. Even their descendants were cursed to carry that mark."</td>

<td>The rot of lies and sin becomes a wound so deep no cosmetics or perfume can conceal it.</td>

<td>Not even magical incense or illusion could completely hide the rot of body and soul inflicted upon the dark elves with dark alchemy.</td>

<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Only then were you able to enjoy true sleep...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Such sweet dreams...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I wonder if I can sleep. Where might I...?</td>
