<td>I'm impressed. I did not expect you to put up such a fight. Envylia seems to have many warriors with great mastery of the spear.</td>

<td>I'm honored to receive such high praise from the renowned Ruinmaker of Wratharis.</td>

<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>It would be an even greater honor if you'd let this spear do its job and run you through, however!</td>

<td>I don't quite understand. You seem to hold a great deal of animosity toward me, specifically. But why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Why? Hmph. Perhaps it's because the words you speak have a familiar cadence to them.</td>
</tr>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>I don't understand. What's that supposed to mean?</td>

<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>You dare speak of bringing an end to war? You, who do nothing but wreak havoc and destruction wherever you go?! It would be laughable, if it weren't so tragic!</td>

<td>Oh. I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>You took from me my muse...the one person possessing the wherewithal and aptitude to actually end this senseless war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>You roam from battle to battle, killing hundreds, and yet you dare speak those same words he did?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>I cannot abide such hypocrisy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tere.png" alt="Theresa" height="128"><br>Theresa</td>
<td>Hng! This technique...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>Ha. Recognize it, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kalmia</td>
<td>It's the same technique he used. He was the one who spoke the words you now so flagrantly expunge from your mouth. The only difference is, he actually meant them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
