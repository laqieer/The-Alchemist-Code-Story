<td>(Incredible. She's fighting toe-to-toe with the Ruinmaker, on her own?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(But...something doesn't seem right. She's not acting like her usual self.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(It's as if she can see nothing but the Ruinmaker. It's a familiar feeling, and I don't like what it implies...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm impressed. I did not expect you to put up such a fight. Envylia seems to have many warriors with great mastery of the spear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm honored to receive such high praise from the renowned Ruinmaker of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It would be an even greater honor if you'd let this spear do its job and run you through, however!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I don't quite understand. You seem to hold a great deal of animosity toward me, specifically. But why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Why? Hmph. Perhaps it's because the words you speak have a familiar cadence to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I don't understand. What's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You dare speak of bringing an end to war? You, who do nothing but wreak havoc and destruction wherever you go?! It would be laughable, if it weren't so tragic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh. I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You took from me my muse...the one person possessing the wherewithal and aptitude to actually end this senseless war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You roam from battle to battle, killing hundreds, and yet you dare speak those same words he did?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I cannot abide such hypocrisy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hng! This technique...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ha. Recognize it, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's the same technique he used. He was the one who spoke the words you now so flagrantly expunge from your mouth. The only difference is, he actually meant them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(I've fought this spear before. That man I felled many battles ago... The one I later learned was a royal prince of Envylia...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(Though he was no match for me, he was a skilled warrior nonetheless. So this girl must beâ€”)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Master! We've been ordered to retreat. Fall back immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Understood. Move out, everyone! There's nothing more for us here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh, no you don't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I-it's fine, Priscilla. We must prioritize helping the injured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ahh... Yes. You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Nothing more for them here, she says...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I suppose for her, the battle is over, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But not for me. There is no end in sight for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I've been fighting this same battle since that day.</td>
