<td>Ooooo Ooooo Ooo!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Squeak! Squ-squ-squeak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wh-what the...?! Are the Demons raising a cry...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Smoke! There are fires all throughout the city! What is going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don! Bad news...the Demons working throughout the city have gone rogue! Most likely, it's not just in this city...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Tango, watch out! Behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Whoa! Thanks. You saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>They're going rampant, but their movements are still clumsy. Even a civilian with a weapon should be able to take them out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don, what should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Tango, you and the men will protect the city. I and the others will head to the clock tower. Protect the city as if your life depended on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yes, Don! Come on, men!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Tsk. Is this Alvarez's doing as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Probably...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No way! Has he already obtained Belphegor?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Don't worry, young lady. If we take the Sacred Stone back from them, everything should return to the way it was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>In order to heal this chaos, we must hurry to the clock tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hey, what are you all standing around for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You heard them, didn't you? Right now, even civilians should be able to take them out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Go on and restrain a Demon or take care of the old and young!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>H-hey...isn't this a really dangerous situation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Both Wratharis and Envylia were destroyed by Demons. Could this be something similar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This is pretty serious! Let's get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No! Are you going to give up before even trying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't listen to the mafia! You'll only get caught up in trouble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ronnie, you stay here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huh?! He-hey, wait. What are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Trust me, I don't want to leave you behind. I'm asking you because you're the only one who I can trust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Tango and the others have their hands full with the Demons. You're the only one who can organize the confused citizens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Don...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>As a full-fledged member of the Don Taras family, this is my order to you. Until I return, you and Tango are to protect this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We'll take on Alvarez and you'll take on the danger that threatens this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Even if we are in different locations, the battle we fight is the same. Do you understand, Ronnie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Tsk. Just promise me one thing. I swore to protect Miss Fiona.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You better do everything you can to protect her in my stead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ronnie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Of course. Leave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Heh. I promise to quell the confusion within this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Just know that if Alvarez beats you...I'll laugh at you from the bottom of my heart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Right back at you. All right...let's get this done and over with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>There's another fire here! Edgar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Steady yourself, little lady. I understand that you want to help them, but if we don't take back the Sacred Stone, nothing will be solved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But...we can't just let these people die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Squeak! Squ-squeak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>There's a child in front of the Demon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Nooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Young lady! Ack... Stop her, comb head!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Tsk! I won't make it on time. Blow it up, massive-arm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ooooo Ooooo Ooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Huh?! D-did I survive?! Th-thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>No thanks are necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Your coat of arms...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We are the army of volunteers that have assembled under Captain Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You're the redhead's underlings?! Tsk. Little lady, step away from him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Bu-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Do not mistake our intentions. We are here to help the citizens of this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Help...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Do not worry. We'll suppress these rogue Demons. You said your name was Edgar, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What is it? What are you scoundrels plotting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Captain Logi said that an action beyond your imagination will be the decisive factor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Please, lend Captain Logi your strength and put an end to Alvarez's violent actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
