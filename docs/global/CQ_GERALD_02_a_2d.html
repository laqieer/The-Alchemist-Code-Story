<td>001</td>
<td>That was easier to deal with than I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>If such a simple matter had taken us any longer, then we would have tarnished the name of the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hahaha, okay. But you know, that was a bit unexpected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Vettel is one thing, but for you to decide to stay behind yourself and fight alone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Here, we swear that our iron will shall stand indomitable in the face of hardship in order to ensure the joy and laughter of the people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Abandoning those clearly in need of our help would go against our creed to ensure the joy and laughter of the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It always amazes me how you and Vettel are so steadfast in your beliefs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Why? Even you must have strong convictions of your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Eh. Nah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What are you talking about? Vettel saw that in you. There's no way that any member of the Scarlet Flame Guard doesn't have their own beliefs to fight for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, I don't. I don't really believe in any of that stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Are you saying that all of your actions up until now have been without any sort of purpose?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why do you have to say it like that? Like I said, I don't have what I don't have. Oh, look! We can see the city up ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Vice-Captain! Ren! I am glad to see you have made it safely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>How are things here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There was a brief scuffle, but there has been no further movement in the desert. In addition, we have not encountered any issues thus far in the reorganization of the city guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We have an emergency! The Commander's daughter has been abducted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We had our eyes on the desert, but then we got caught from behind! Damn it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This city's got more problems than one. It's a mistake to assume it was the desert ruffians that did this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'd like to inspect the daughter's room. Come on, Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This is it. It was in this state by the time we realized she was gone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It looks like someone ransacked this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hm... This coat of arms... Is this what the ruffians have on their flags?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Would they really just blatantly leave incriminating evidence laying around like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Look at these footprints. This is soil. You don't really see much of that in the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Are you saying that it's the bandits from the mountains trying to frame the desert ruffians and turn us against them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>How likely might it be that the desert ruffians are deliberately trying to frame the bandits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Eh. It's easy to fake a coat of arms if you know what it looks like. Soil is harder to replicate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>There were no reports of any movement in the desert, right? How could they sneak past your people into the mountains before we got here? In fact, how would they have known whether or not we were coming?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>How are we gonna do this, Gerald? These guys don't seem too clever. The two of us should be enough to take them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If it's as you say, then the desert ruffians likely have nothing to do with this kidnapping.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We'll keep eyes on them for now, just in case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Meanwhile, I'll make my way to where the bandits are camping out. Ren and I will bring back the Commander's daughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh... You believed what I said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Your conclusions were sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Is that the second nice thing you've said to me, Gerald? Be still my heart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Heh heh... Scarlet Flame Guard, huh? Whatever. Just another bunch of worthless knights. As long as this starts a fight between them and those desert scabs...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Once it does, we'll take that city. That girl is key to our plan, so make sure you don't hurt her too bad, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Let go of her, villains!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>They've come after us?! How could they figure it out so fast?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well, well, caught red-handed. Let's not make this difficult. Give us the girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>In your dreams! Come on, hurry up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hold it right there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Whoa there. Hold on a minute, Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Traps...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Duh. No self-respecting band of bandits doesn't have a defense mechanism or twenty to defend their territory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We have no choice. We'll just have to dodge them as we go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Roger that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>More traps? This is getting ridiculous. I didn't actually think they'd have this many.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>We're approaching the summit. We'll be at a disadvantage on lower ground comparatively... The hostage makes this tricky, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Then why don't I go around the back and rescue the daughter first? That'll make it easier for you to maneuver, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>If you can do that, I'll attack them head-on to draw their attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Just remember that saving a hostage under such heavy guard isn't going to be easy, even for someone with your abilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Was that a compliment?! Ahem, right. We've got our plan, let's do this. See you on the other side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hmph, he's pretty quick...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Now it's my turn to show what I can do...</td>
