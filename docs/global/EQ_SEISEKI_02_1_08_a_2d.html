<td>Chihaya, where are you? We need to find her quickly.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Chihaya has the power of a shrine maiden, so she won't be defeated that easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Still, we can't afford for her to be on her own. You were being pursued, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What is the pursuer like? Have you seen him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes. He's a super strong and scary guy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>If he finds Chihaya before we do, I'm sure he'llâ€”</td>

<td>Don't worry! It'll be okay. After all, we're Paladins!</td>

<td>Yep, yep. Even if he's captured her already, we'll get her back safely!</td>

<td>Well, you both look like children. I feel like even I could defeat you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What did you say? Hold on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Kagura is one thing, but you think I look like a child too? I can't pretend I didn't hear that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, perfect timing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Watch carefully, Mizuchi. I'll show you that I'm no child!</td>
