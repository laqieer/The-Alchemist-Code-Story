<td>Such a thing exists?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It used to be held quite frequently. The Sprite Quartet would gather in one place under the watchful eyes of our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>By holding it in front of our people, it would eliminate any possibility of cheating and promote real-time interactions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This law applies to all of Saga, so even that brat Tehre won't be able to dismiss it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's called...the Sprite Quartet Discourse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That would provide a medium for concrete discussion. This shines a little more hope on our situation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, we've never held one since going from a Quartet to a Trio, but it's worth trying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It may take a while to persuade Tehre, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If we convey everything honestly and leave no room for misunderstanding...it could open a new path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Then let's start preparing immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ah. First, we'll have to send an official messenger to Tehre. Do you think we can ask you, Tina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'll go with you as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Of course, I'm going too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'll write the letter of summoning. Would you mind returning with me to Fuu and then heading out from there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Not at all! Rest assured that I will successfully complete my mission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You fill me with confidence. Thank you, Tina and Lisbeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If it weren't for you, I doubt we would've landed on the idea of a Sprite Trio Discourse. Those were some fine ideas you put out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No, if it weren't for Mocca, I wouldn't have been able to change in the first place. If you should thank anyone, it should be Mocca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Not in the least. I am constantly being rescued by Tina's sense of responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ahaha! Come on, you guys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm complimenting you. You could just accept it, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm simply speaking the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Heheh. That's quite the bond you two share. I expected great things from you two Wind Shamans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well then, let's head back immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Voda! Please...please, help! The village...our village...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Calm down. What is this presence I feel? What is going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Our village was attacked by the Jam! They came so suddenly! Please...please, help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm taking Beelzebub! Farewell, Godwolf Asena!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Agh...no...! How could this happen...?! Aaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What's the matter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Tina...did you "see" something again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hurry...we need to hurry! I won't allow it! Such a thing must not be allowed to happen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Tina! Calm down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>How can I be calm?! Asena...I saw Asena fall at the hands of Georgios!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...Asena?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Let's hurry...before all hope is lost!</td>
