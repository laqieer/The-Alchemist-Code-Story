<td>Mistakes...do happen. Sometimes, secure communication can be difficult in a pinch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dahab</td>
<td>You didn't hear anything from me, however, so you should have simply kept your focus and completed the mission. For you to come back with your tail between your legs like this is shameful.</td>

<td>Zalam Gaim looks to its star for guidance. But after this abysmal showing, your light is going to be flickering out now. You do realize this, don't you?</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>

<td>To be honest, Lady Najam, I'm a little scared of what Zalam Gaim is becoming. I barely even recognize it anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sakani</td>
<td>Of course, when push comes to shove, I believe we should do what's best for the order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
