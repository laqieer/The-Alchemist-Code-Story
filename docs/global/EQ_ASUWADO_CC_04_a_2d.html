<td>Najam! Why? Why didn't you kill Ryle?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Najam! You will address this matter immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Dahab. Why didn't you tell me the client was dead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ah, that. Well, you see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The intermediary is obligated to keep tabs on the client and target alike, and promptly inform the assassin of any complications that may arise. That is as much a part of our doctrine as anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You should have known the client's status by the time I started the job. So why, then, was I not informed?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Mistakes...do happen. Sometimes, secure communication can be difficult in a pinch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You didn't hear anything from me, however, so you should have simply kept your focus and completed the mission. For you to come back with your tail between your legs like this is shameful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Zalam Gaim looks to its star for guidance. But after this abysmal showing, your light is going to be flickering out now. You do realize this, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It looks like the order is largely standing behind Dahab now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see. With the master so ill, I'm sure everyone must be uncertain of their future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Zalam Gaim is all we have. If the order crumbles, we have nowhere else to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Perhaps Dahab's way is right. If his guidance is the support everyone needs...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You can't be serious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Sakani, you would do better without me. Your standing in the order will only worsen if you continue to associate with a fallen star like myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What are you saying?! I will always stand by your side, Lady Najam! Now and forever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You're still the star I look up to. That hasn't changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Am I, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>News of your failure will definitely send waves through the order...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But it won't change who you are. You're still an important figure to us all. You're still a star that shines down on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>All this talk of stars...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Have I really done anything worthy of that title? This whole time, I've just taken jobs and completed them, my only goal being to protect the place I call home.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(That's why I always scoffed at the Najam title given to me. It's never held any meaning or value, as far as I was concerned.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(I wonder when it began to mean so much to everyone else...when I began to be held in such high esteem...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>To be honest, Lady Najam, I'm a little scared of what Zalam Gaim is becoming. I barely even recognize it anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Of course, when push comes to shove, I believe we should do what's best for the order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But...is this it? Is this the direction Zalam Gaim should be headed in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Your strict adherence to the rules sets you apart from other assassins' guilds. It's practically what you're all about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Seems to me like your whole system is in danger of collapse when you make an exception like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Sakani...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Would you do me a favor?</td>
