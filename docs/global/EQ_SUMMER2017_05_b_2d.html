<td>The loincloths are...resonating with each other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Don't look!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What? Gormalas is starting to cry...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Whooaa... Why do the tears fall from my eyes?! No...this isn't me crying...it's the loincloth's tears!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...Why are the two of them crying?</td>

<td>Dilga! What's the matter?! They're acting strange!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh...? Suddenly, they look like different people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, Strike tribe...your Festival Performance was spectacular.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Tight Tribe...I am sorry for what occurred back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We questioned our own pride and betrayed the fit and comfort of the loincloth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What we destroyed...was the very thing that represented our tribes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>As a result...even if we wished to fight one another, we no longer can. This gave birth to lasting unfinished business...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Having now borrowed another's body to fulfill our goal...I do apologize to this man.</td>

<td>Oh, Strike tribe...what is a loincloth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is not the loincloth the heart?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The heart...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Indeed. All people equally wear a loincloth upon their heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The heart's loincloth varies in color, in shape...and is not bound by rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>A free...loincloth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>They sound strangely divine, but...isn't what they're saying actually pretty lacking in substance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>How long do we have to play along with the farce?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I see. In our desire to fight...we force our loincloths on others...that was an outrageous act.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What mistakes we have made...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The loincloth is a free heart... Those who can encounter such a formidable foe are only a handful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Without our battles, our bodies that were sharpened in order to protect our lands...began to decline Eventually we lost all momentum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We the Tight tribe passed on the soul of a loincloth Wadatsumi...and then we perished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The De tribe perished as well...because of the mistakes our tribe committed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>All is well now. We have fought here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The Festival Tribe will now and forever be concluded as a draw. Together we will watch over this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>To all those who have observed what has occurred here...thank you. We have long waited in the depths of the dark sea for this moment to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Thank you...once again, give us instructions as the Tight tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>And give this man your gratitude also...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>And to this man...who carried on the custom of the righteous loincloth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Thank you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...Ahh...! Ack... This is too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What beautiful and ferocious friendship...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Tsk...I thought it was such a meaningless piece of cloth...but now I've witnessed your strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hmph... The loincloth suits you well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ack...shut up already! Argh. I've got a weird pain in my hips...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Let's go home, people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The Go tribe was able to unleash their regret... Come now, let's enjoy the peaceful beach once again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Seriously? This is how it ends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>All that happened was two men brandished their loincloths!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I don't really get it, but...I can check that off my list! Mielikki, let's eat some ice cream!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yayâ™ªLet's go together, Yomi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I want strawberry flavor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Well then, I'll excuse myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Please wait, Dilga! Please tell me about your memories of the De and Go Tribes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Fine then! However, this is something that must be taught through the flesh. My way of teaching is demanding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The peaceful summer vacation of the beach resort was protected by the true man of the sea, Dilga.</td>
