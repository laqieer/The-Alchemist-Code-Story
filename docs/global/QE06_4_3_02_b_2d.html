<td>Ngh! How do you know that technique?! How can you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The lost art of Kagutsuchi. Particularly effective against demons...and already used once before to cast you out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Do you remember that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That red hair...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Whoa! That Kagutsuchi technique sure is somethin' else! With just one strike, Tamba's been slowed to a crawl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We might actually have a chance now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>How's the rookie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>She overdid it a bit while she was channeling us into the dagger, so it might be a while till she's back on her feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hmph. Well, she revived Kagutsuchi. That's the accomplishment of a lifetime. Let's show this demon his place, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That swordsmanship... It's like I'm looking at Lady Celis! Did you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yeah. My father taught me how to fight, but now it's my mother who helped me train. You can thank Amane for giving me that chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Amane helped me discover what ties me to Wadatsumi, and got me fully committed to doing whatever I can to protect the way of life here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I pray for the safety of all! For all of Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Logi, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Amane?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hey, now! Little dizzy, ain'tcha? You shouldn't push yourself like that. We got this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Don't worry about me. I won't be passing out anytime soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Have you come to die as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I have no such plans for that, either. Listen, Tamba.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I want to protect you as well—your way of life. Your memories and feelings. I know how much you cared for the twins born to Koga and Kaede.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Was the time you spent with them not precious to you? I know it must've been. And that alone proves that humans and demons can get along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Haven't I told you never to speak those names?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Do you really wish to go down this wicked road, Tamba? To mindlessly kill others while you, yourself, wither away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Agh! I said shut up!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…Ghah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Jubei! The blade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Now, Logi! Direct your Kagutsuchi at Sumeragi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Kagutsuchi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ohh! Sumeragi is reacting! Kagutsuchi's flames have made it shine even brighter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We've reunited the Sacred Three of Wadatsumi. But this time, it's not to vanquish demons, it's to restore Wadatsumi to its rightful state of being!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We're not here to fight you. We want to bring back the Wadatsumi you once knew: a place where humans and demons could live alongside each other in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And I won't let you get in the way of that! No matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Enough of your nonsense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The sword might've been amplified, but that means nothing if the blade and its wielder are not in sync. So much for your little revival!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'll be taking back my horn now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Crap! What do we do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Amane...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Tamba is very close to Sumeragi right now. This might actually be our chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Let's be reckless one more time. If I lose consciousness here, I'm trusting you to handle things until I wake up again, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wait... You're serious? You're going to do it again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The thing I'd like to connect to is right in front of my eyes. If I try hard enough, I think I can pull it off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Is that...Alchemy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You fool! You think you have even the faintest chance of striking me down?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I have no intention of striking you at all. Jubei, please hand me Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Huh? Do you have a plan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What are you up to now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Humans and demons can live together, and I'm going to prove that to you right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What is this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I don't know where I am, but I can still feel your presence. Stop this trickery at once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I know that technique, Amane! It won't work on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Sorry, but I'm afraid that's not my name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'm Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>And I'm Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It's been a long time, Uncle Tamba.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
