<td>Wait, Dias. Look, over there! Father is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>He's cut out of the conversation! The girls aren't even acknowledging his presence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Father, what could you have done to be ignored so...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hello! I'm Caesar! My friends call me General Caesar the Demon Flame!</td>

<td>We called ourselves "The Word to Your Mothers."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Father, please...</td>

<td>Yo momma's so fat that when she fell, nobody was laughing, but the ground was cracking up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yo momma's so stupid she climbed over a glass wall to see what was on the other side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yo momma's so fat her belly button gets home fifteen minutes before she does!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yo momma's so fat, when I asked her to touch her toes, she asked me what they were!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yo momma's so ugly she has to sneak up to the mirror!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Father...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>A-Agatha?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Why were you saying all of those horrible things?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>W-well, they're just jokes, but... I mean, I'm not talking about any specific person... You see—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh, dear. He's having to explain his jokes.</td>

<td>Dias, were they funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>051</td>
<td>Girl, we may meet again. I will have you laughing then.</td>
