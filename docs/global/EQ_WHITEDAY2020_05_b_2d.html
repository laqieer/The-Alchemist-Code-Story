<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>U-uhm! Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But why did you come? You were so mad that I wasn't doing things the way you told me to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I am still upset about that, to be honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>O-oh, I'm sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>However, it is my fault for not trying to meet you halfway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If I am the one who caused you to torment yourself over that to the point of embarking on a dangerous quest, then I am sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>N-no way! This is just... I selfishly wanted to do this to see you smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>And I hoped that drinking this tea would delight the party guests and bring them smiles as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I just thought that if I could do that, I would be able to finally express my honest feeling of gratitude...so I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Sigh... You really are astonishingly earnest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I should have confirmed this with you from the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Miss Plumeria, what exactly do you think White Day is for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>White Day? Isn't it a day for expressing gratitude to those who have shown you kindness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Just as I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I... What? Am I mistaken? I thought it was a wonderful event where people can give thanks to each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I had hoped that if people could find the courage to say what they needed to on White Day, then they wouldn't have to regret failing to speak up like I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see. Your hospitality is one in which you strive for everyone to be joyous and regret-free.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Somehow, I've come to prioritize efficiency above all else.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(Even though true hospitality is meant to be...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You see, Master Ankh, the most important tenet of hospitality is compassion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It is not all that difficult to do. Much like baking a cake, you just imagine the face of those enjoying what you've prepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Mmm, smells good. So this is the legendary tea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I did not expect you to find it with the little information I gave you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hehe. My desire to express gratitude towards someone in particular and the essence of your hospitality, Ankh, is what guided me here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What does that even mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So this is the fruit of your dedicated efforts, you mean, Plumeria. This legendary tea will certainly boost the quality of our party.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Thanks to this, I am sure it will be a fine party that brings joy to its guests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Now that all the preparations are complete, it is time for the party to begin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ah, I'm getting nervous. I've never been on the side of providing hospitality. I hope I do well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Miss Plumeria? What are you doing there? Your post is over here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You're this party's very first guest, Plumeria.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I... What?! What do you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We have a reward for you because you put so much effort into preparing for this party.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>B-but...! I haven't really done anything to deserve a reward, have I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Plumeria, if you will let me explain to you what White Day is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That isn't necessary. There is nothing wrong with her interpretation of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Besides, I owe Miss Plumeria a word of thanks. She helped me remember something very important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh my! Cake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It has been a while since I've baked one. I hope you enjoy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Y-you made this yourself?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Do not worry. We will still be serving the sweets you sacrificed the kitchen to prepare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I just felt the urge to bake. I hope it suits your taste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Plumeria...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>If there's something you feel like you ought to say, I'd hate for you to regret not saying it right about...now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh! Uhm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Th-thank you very much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You are very welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I was worried there for a moment, but Plumeria seems happy. All's well that ends well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yeah, she really does seem happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Perfect! That's exactly what I wanted! White Day is all about pleasing the ladies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hey, Kevin... There's something I want to ask you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yeah? Just so you know, White Day isn't a day for rare treats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yeah, I got that already, geez. Actually, there's someone I wanted to express gratitude towards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What? You?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Plumeria's sincerity seems to have rubbed off on me. No... It's something I've needed to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>So I have to do this right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Heh, a day to express gratitude, huh? Not bad. Sure, Reimei. Who do you want me to call?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yo. Sorry I'm not just another couple in distress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Ha! You must think I have nothing but other people's relationships on my mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Don't you? You love gossip like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Sure I do, but!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>More importantly, I'm glad Plumeria seems to be smiling from the bottom of her heart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>What? What are you staring at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>N-nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Hey, uh... I have something that Iâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Oh no! I almost forgot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Today is White Day! There are probably couples in need of my help all over town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I have to go answer their call! Gotta go, bye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>H-hey! Wait, I was just about to...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I heard there would be tasty sweets here. Am I in the right place...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I honestly had no interest in White Day, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>They seem to be having fun. Maybe I should just take a little peek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>We're so happy to celebrate this White Day with you!</td>
