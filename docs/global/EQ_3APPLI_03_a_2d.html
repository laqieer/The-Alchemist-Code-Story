<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Whoa! What is this black thing?! It's wrapping around my body!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ack... My power is being drained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I...will...eat...you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I...will...eat...every...part...of...you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Aghhhhhh! It's moving inside me!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What's the matter, Yomi?! Hurry! Run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No! We need to save him or he'll be devoured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yomi! I'm going to save you! Give me your hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Aghhh! Sakura!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>All right, I got you. Let's run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We can't see the mist anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's troublesome. Who knows where or when it'll appear next.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Uff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yomi? Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh? What happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Are you serious? You were just shouting your head off after you got caught up in that black thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What are you talking about? What black thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh? You don't remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey! Yomi, hang in there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Maybe this is with Rena meant when she said it'll eat your memories?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?! It ate her memories?! Hey, Yomi! Do you know who I am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Um...Sakura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Phew... What a relief. I just didn't want to be forgotten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Since the mist barely touched her, it looks like she's only lost her most recent memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But...why did those monsters appear from inside that mist?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That thing is supposed to be something that eats things. My memory is somehow frayed. There must be something that I can't remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Losing your memories is forgetting your own existence. It's a very sad thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hey...you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh? Me? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You remind me of someone. Who was it again? Umm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yomi, what's up with you? One moment you're spacing out and the next you're saying something bizarre... Are you really okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh! That's right! I remember! You remind me of the old hag!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The old...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yes, of course! The old hag, the old hag! You look like the old hag! Don't you think so, Sakura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Now that you mention it, you might it be right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh? D-do I look that old?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No, no! That's not what I meant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You remind me of when the old hag was young! Sorry for surprising you! Ahahah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>When she was young...? I'm relieved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hey, Yomi, stop saying strange things!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well, I suddenly remembered, that's all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Memories are strange things. You forget one thing and remember another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That being said, an opponent who eats memories is a frightening one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>If we have to fight it again and it eats our memories...will we even be able to fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I have an idea! Let's take a photograph now, just in case it eats our memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It's too dangerous not knowing who our opponents and allies are on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>A photograph? That might be a good idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>But how are we going to take it? It's not like we have a camera.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Don't worry. I have my smartphone with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Smart...phone? What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>A smartphone is a device that you can use to, amongst other things, make calls and take photos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Amazing! You can take photos with something this thin?! If only Slothstein had this kind of technology!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Um... What is a photo?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Huh, what's going on? What are you gonna take?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The black mist...the one who gives birth to it...with its thoughts... I think I'm about to remember something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Everyone, get close. You too, Rena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh, what? Now isn't the time for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>All right, here goes. Say "cheese!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Umm... What did you say about cheese?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What?! Did you just take something?! Wait, did you take my youth?! Am I gonna become like the old hag?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hey, Chloe! Am I all wrinkled up?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Don't worry. You're still young, Sakura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What a relief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>He-hey... I was just about to remember something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What's that black thing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>It's approaching from inside again! Inside...that...I remember!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>There are so many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Let's quickly defeat it and run!</td>
