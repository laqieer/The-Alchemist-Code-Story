<td>Wh-what...?! Setsuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>All right. Let's finish for now. I just received some food, so eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh? N-no...more importantly, about our conversation just now...about Envylia...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Right now, Logi, your brain lacks nutrition. Even if we continued to talk now, you will just remain pessimistic. A fatigued mind and empty stomach weakens the heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ack... Un-understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This brings back memories. We used to eat like this together, didn't we? We decided that we would always eat after training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It was hard training under you, but...back then, things were a lot of fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...They were for me too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The truth is, I was never very good at teaching people...but I did enjoy our time together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I was wandering aimlessly, having lost everything. I am truly grateful to Zeke for providing me with another chance to experience warmth again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I was really surprised when Zeke told me that he wanted me to train the two of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>He could've trained you himself, but he went out of his way to ask me. Do you know why that is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh...? N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There was a darkness to that blade of his. When one wields a blade against another human, this will inevitably happen. But, if you're not careful, eventually that darkness will turn against you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>He didn't want to teach the two of you to fight that way. That's why Zeke asked me. There was no darkness to my bladeâ€”it was a pure power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You and Dias were Zeke's hope. He wanted to raise you to wield your blade without a shred of darkness. The two of you had that potential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>For that reason especially, I taught only the two of you how to wield your blades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And yet...Dias is now gone and I find you lying on the ground here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Seeing the destruction of Envylia, I could hardly believe what had happened. Yet, seeing you now, I fully grasp that the country has fallen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The destruction...?! Envylia...fallen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So you really didn't know. Right now, it's under the jurisdiction of the Holy Guard, but it's not a very safe place to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>How is this possible? We fought so hard...for peace...for peace between Envylia and Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I see. So you still believe that nonsense, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I seem to have failed to teach you properly. Logi, Let's go another round after eating. There should be something more you have to say with that blade of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wh-why...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That way you can protect what is important to you next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>!!!</td>
