<td>...I guess there's no sign of her, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Rox, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Have faith. Miss Roxanne may be a little headstrong, but she is far from careless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How fare your wounds?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I've had worse... But I wouldn't do it again so soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh, I'm going to string you up for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If you thought that was heroic of you, you're terribly wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Did you think I'd let rats like you scurry around without a care?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Taunt all you want. You'll still have to get past me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Again?! Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Nesha! Drop the rat and go after the prisoner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Tch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Mark my words, Prince Charming: I'm not through with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Gh... Guess I've got no choice but to run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That Nesha's a vicious one. I'd hate to think what would happen to Rox and Emrys...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>From my observations, it seems that this entire part of Slothstein is on lockdown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Even accounting for a more optimistic viewpoint, I have not seen even a shadow of the two of them for well over a week.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Those are grim odds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Indeed. And if the two have fallen into their clutches, they might demand Soren and Eira in exchange for their safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I highly doubt they'd offer a safe transaction, if that were the case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Still, with no news reaching us yet, we can safely assume the two are still out there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But after all that's happened, the longer we stay in Slothstein, the more we run the risk of being discovered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>All the more reason we should find them before Goetia gets to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Siegfried...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I know you're worried about Roxanne, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Eira...go too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Find Emmy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Eira, you can't. They're looking for us; you'd be walking right into their jaws!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But Emmy...hurt! Pretty Sis too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Eira help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Soren's right. It's too dangerous for you to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Stay here and let me handle it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No, NEITHER of you will be going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Until we figure out the best course of action, no one is going anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>There was this girl with a greatsword. Red, I believe they called her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Her strength was incredible. She tore through my robots like tissue paper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Not to mention knocking my lights out. Her aura really is something else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Uuu... Scary smell lady...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...No! Save...Emmy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hey! Where do you think you're going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Grr...! Let...go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Dormach! Anwyn! Gwyn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Grrrrr!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What the—OW!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Damn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>We've got to go after her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Shion, can you stay here with Soren?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Certainly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Be careful, both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>This is a horrible situation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>If they have any means of detecting anomalous auras...they'll find her for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>We can only hope for the best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(For whatever reason, though, the ambient energy in this place—no, all of Slothstein—seems heavier than usual...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huff...huff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Emmy...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Arf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Arf! Arf arf!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Hey! It's the fox-girl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Heh heh...if I catch you all by myself I'm gonna get a big raise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Grrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What's all that noise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>*gasp*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Uuu... Emmy...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It's just a damned fox! Pull yourself together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Come on, grab the girl and be done with it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Auugghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>An unwise move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...Big Sis...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Sound the alarm! I want that witch taken down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yes sir!</td>
