<td>There you are! Hey, Decel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Why did you suddenly disappear on me the other day?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ah... Sorry about that. I was told that the enemy had suddenly appeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>More importantly, there have been quite a large number of casualties amongst the villagers. Do you think you can help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You're just gonna run away again, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'll keep my promise. In any case, we don't have enough available hands and many of the injured are in a critical state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>As someone who is involved in medicine, I'd like to request your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm not really involved in medicine, it's just that my mother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's nothing. Fine. But, in return, you'll have to do whatever I tell you for a month.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Thank you. The pain is a lot better now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>All you need to do now is rest. Also, be sure to eat properly. If you don't have money then use this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Y-you do too much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. I'm acting on a whim.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Thank you. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Now I can buy something nourishing for my daughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This isn't for your daughter, it's for you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ah, never mind. Just hurry up and get better, so that you she can stop worrying about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>See, you can give proper medical treatment. You're even capable of improving the patient's environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You should've told me if you were watching. Now I feel embarrassed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>She reminded me a little of my mom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Did I tell you? My mom is suffering from one of those incurable diseases.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Without treatment, she doesn't have long left to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's why I'm doing whatever it takes to make a medicine that can heal her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes. I'm willing to do whatever it takes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I see. That explains why you're so obsessed with research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If that were the case, you should've told me sooner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Decel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If there's anything I can do, I'd like to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Of course, to the extent that I don't suffer any bodily harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Heheh. You said it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Everyone! You heard that, didn't you?! Decel is gonna help with my research!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>He said he'll do anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>He-hey, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yeah! Now I can advance the research for my latest medicine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Actually, I just came up with a new one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Wait! What's with the sudden smile?! Was that story you just told me about your mom a lie?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No. That's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But, more than, I'm just happy that you're gonna help me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? I'm gonna do whatever it takes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Right. It's all right if I mix that with the medicine from before, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm sure you'll be able to handle it, Decel. Plus, you can give me a detailed report...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Sorry! I can't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hey! That's not what you promised me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You said that you'd do anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I didn't say that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Anyway, hold on!</td>
</tr>
