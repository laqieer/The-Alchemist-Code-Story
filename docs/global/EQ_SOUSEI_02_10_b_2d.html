<td>Heheh! That was fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No, it was not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why did I have to get attacked?! Was there any reason why I had to get beat up?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Did you have to attack us too?! Nyx and I are on your side! Your team!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't mind the little details. Endure this for your frail old teacher, won't you? Would you truly begrudge me some entertainment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Who's supposed to be frail? We're the ones at death's door thanks to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Give it up, Mira. You know how she can be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I don't want to hear anything from the loser who stayed in the back the whole fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Come on, Mira. I'm always the one cleaning up your messes, the least you can do is deal with being in the line of fire for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ugh, I wish I was an only child sometimes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Anyway, I'm glad I got to see your skills. There were some amateurish moments, but you'll do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Aren't I generous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Um, Miss Ambrosia...? What was the purpose of that little exercise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmm, well, as I'm sure you know, Asmodeus is stronger than I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I wasn't exactly sure if defeating it would be possible, even after peeling away the Lust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But seeing as your powers are reaching heights comparable to "her"... Truly, the things you come to see once you live long enough are incredible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ah, pay no mind. Now, let's get to work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I would estimate we have three days until Asmodeus heals from her wounds and strikes again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Though the future is infinite, the time available to us now is very finite. There's no time to lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What are you doing?! The way you're wiring that is so inefficient!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huh? Magically speaking, this makes the most sense. I'm taking fault lines and astrology into consideration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Right, okay, but you have to think of the conversion rate! We've got to redesign this whole section here, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What? No! Yna, can you tell him to stop?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm no expert, but if we redesign this part here, wouldn't we get the best of both perspectives?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Alrighty then! Almost done with the broth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Wow, Mira, I didn't know you could cook.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What? This is basic stuff. Oh, wow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Is... Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well, I just thought, um, that's a very unique way of holding a kitchen knife. Have you...ever cooked before, Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Uhm... Not really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Back home, they wouldn't let me. They said it's not something a Shrine Maiden should be doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Uh-huh... You're one of those princess types, huh? Well, now's a good time to learn! I can teach you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Heheheh, leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Even that nitpicky Nyx said my cooking was "bafflingly good, all things considered."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Was that supposed to be a compliment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hnngh! Haah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No... This isn't enough to affect the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I need to be better! Sharper!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This fight will be our first step towards saving the Gula Belt Region, our home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We cannot lose, no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Tomorrow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You've got quite a look on your face. You're ready, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Miss Ambrosia. How are you feeling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hm? My wounds are fine. Mira and Nyx are very efficient with their healing magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What is it, boy? Is there something on my face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I just thought of something I would like to ask you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You said all the people of this region were turned to insects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Why not Mira or Nyx? I cannot figure out how they evaded that fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I know it is insensitive of me to ask. It is of course your right not to indulge my curiosity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It doesn't hurt to remember the past from time to time. I wouldn't say it's an interesting story, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>A long time ago, there was a witch obsessed with her own research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That witch had an apprentice. She loved and cherished her dearly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>This apprentice was so beautiful, no man could resist falling in love with her, even knowing that love would turn them into insects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The witch refused to allow these men to turn her apprentice into an insect. She racked her mind for every method to keep them away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>But it was all for naught. There was no way for her to control her apprentice's heart. The apprentice fell in love with a man behind the witch's back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It was a pure love unbefitting of this region saturated with lust, and all the more beautiful for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>And yet, the witch was enraged by it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Which is completely reasonable, you know?! I mean, getting in a relationship without her guardian's consent?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Ahem. Anyway, the apprentice had learned both magic and stubbornness from her teacher. She eloped with the man and began a life with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>From what I've heard, they were a loving, happy husband and wife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Sadly, such happiness doesn't last long in this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Soon, the apprentice conceived a child. The man became an insect and lost his self.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>After having endured the witch's training, the apprentice was able to maintain her human form for a while, but ultimately could not resist fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>As her due date approached, so did the limits of her endurance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It was then that the witch visited her and asked the question she had waited to ask.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You wretched fool. Was it worth it? Was the fleeting experience of love worth losing your entire self?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Not at all nice, was it? Thinking back on it now, that was a very immature thing to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>And yet, the apprentice smiled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I have no regrets. I accepted it all the moment I loved him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>The apprentice said she wanted the same for her children: the chance to make a decision on their own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Children born from insects are born as insects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>To ensure her children would be born as humans, she needed to remain human herself to the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Respecting her apprentice's wishes, the witch cast a spell on her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>It was a spell of death. It was the only way to let the girl, already showing signs of turning, die as a human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Even with several lifetimes dedicated to nothing but the study of magic, this was all the witch was able to do for her beloved apprentice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>To keep the children human, the witch killed their mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>And the twins grew healthy and strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Under the care of the one who ended their mother's life...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>That's all there is to say about my apprentices and me. I told you it wasn't an interesting story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Now, now... What's with that serious face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Do you pity us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>N-no, not at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Remember this, boy. What you imagine happiness to be is nothing more than happiness for yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Until you understand that, your lofty ideals may become something that only perpetuates sorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>My lofty ideals...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Ah... Forget it. I seem to be getting preachy in my old age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>We will soon be facing Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Rest while you can and make yourself ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>My ideals...? How could wanting to free people from the Cursed Beasts cause sorrow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>No! There's no way! I won't let that happen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I have to... I mean, we have to end the cycle of irrational tragedies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Got it! It's finished!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>All right. Not bad for something cobbled together last minute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Though I don't really care for needing two control sticks to accommodate the increase in functional capacity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Truly? It looked to me like the rod was designed for exactly that purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Well... Ambrosia estimated that it'd take a generation to defeat Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I assume she expected Mira and me to handle half each.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>It sounds like things are miraculously going exactly as she planned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Anyway, we just need to link this to the airship's reactor and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Now we should be able to use the airship's mechanics to power the magic rod Libra's system!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>We've also devised a plan to fight against Asmodeus as advantageously as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>The key factor is how much Asmodeus will be able to heal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>We'll just have to deal with that when it comes up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>First, we must halt the Cursed Beast's movements. That's when the magic rod will deliver the spell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>That should allow our attacks to be effective, if I am correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>You are. But first, we will need to regain control of the airship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I'm not sure if Asmodeus will be there or not, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>We have to assume those ice beasts will be roaming around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>When the town was assaulted, we were overwhelmed, partially because of the fact that we were ambushed, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>A lot of it had to do with those ice beasts being more burdensome than expected. We can't have them using their numbers against us like that again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>You're right. We'd better make sure we don't get surrounded by them again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>That's why speed is going to be key in this mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Mira, Nyx, can you two teleport us there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Hmm... We might be able to do a one-way trip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>But we'd be severely drained afterwards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>That might have an adverse affect on our plans ahead. Fine, we will walk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Regarding that, I have an idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Indeed I do. Winnick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>We will deliver you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>But you cannot withstand the cold. Isn't it dangerous for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Not a problem. Ambrosia is kind. We are legion. One life weighed against many, irrelevant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>That's just...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Don't worry, they will be shielded by one of my protective spells.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Winnick, is it just my imagination, or do you have a different attitude towards the others compared to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Say something! That's the attitude I'm talking about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Ah, ahem! Well, like I said... You don't have to worry about their safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>If you say so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>We will gladly accept their help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Everyone, please listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>We will now head out to defeat the Cursed Beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>This will be a perilous task. Possibly futile, even.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>But to save the people of this region, and to save our own region someday, we must do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I walk this path with no hesitation in order to save all! So I ask you to lend me a hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Let us go remake the world!</td>
</tr>
