<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Everyone! Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Right! 'Scuse me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are these all of the merchant caravans from the central desert?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah. These are all of the scheduled deliveries. Let's head back to the oasis for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Should we really be doing this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What do you mean, Logi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>As we stand here, Gluttony's army is preparing to invade the desert again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If we're going to be attacking the royal capital, shouldn't we get our soldiers together and head out already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Instead, we're here, guarding merchant caravans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The soldiers in the oasis won't be coming with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It is those who desire a revolution for their country who will be conducting the attack upon the royal capital. Of course, we will still be needing their help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Those who have gathered in the desert will draw out Gluttony's main forces and delay them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The Liberation Army, together with those of us who have made contracts with the Door of Truth, will use the time they buy us to launch our surprise assault on the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I was hoping that we would be able to join up with the Blue Tongues before that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We still haven't heard anything from them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>According to the civilians who escaped the city, they were last seen heading out toward the desert to draw those mysterious attackers away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Gluttony's reinforcements are slowly gathering at the border. They are clearly not ready to invade immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Their army has been routed once, however temporarily. It will take them some time to regroup and regain their morale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>According to the information we received from our merchant contacts in Gluttony Foss, it sounds like it's going to take them about a week.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In other words, we still have time before they invade the desert again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Considering that, I think that we can spare some people to search for the Blue Tongues while our army in the oasis is getting itself ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Right. Thanks, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Don't mention it. We're all in this together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>In any case, we just have to hold tight for a while, and do all we can before the Gluttony army gets here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So thenâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We should clear this area of monsters. That should help facilitate the replenishment of supplies.</td>
