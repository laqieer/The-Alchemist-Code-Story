<td>I feel uneasy.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>About what? I'm not entirely sure, but a vague, indistinct unease lingers at the back of my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ahh, that's it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I feel uneasy because I am unsure. I am flustered because of all that I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Being so shaken makes me feel incredibly small.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Where do all of these feelings come from?</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Even as I ask myself that question, the answer rises to the forefront of my mind, taking a most familiar form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>His.</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So bright it hurts to look at it.</td>

<td>Forgetting about what I ought to protect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What is it that I want to protect?</td>

<tr>

<td>Gerald? Gerald! Are you even listening to me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Urgh! As I was saying, we're here! At the ruins? Where the bandits from the request are based? Is any of this ringing any bells?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes... Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Gerald! This is the first request we've gotten in a long while, so pull yourself together! You're not acting like yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I know what I need to do. Everybody ready? Then it's time. We're going in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>There are fewer here than we expected. Are the rest hiding somewhere?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It doesn't matter. Our plan doesn't change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We will shortly be entering the bandits' base to eradicate them, as per the request we received. I will draw them out to give you the chance you need to crush every last one of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>G-Gerald! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Here I go! Together, we will complete this request, and what's more...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We will make the name of our Scarlet Legion known throughout the entirety of Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
