<td>Ugh! Don't follow me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm coming with you!</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No! Stay! You...just stay right there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Nope! I'm coming with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is Wadatsumi's problem, which makes it my problem—but it isn't yours! So just go back to Envylia like a good little boy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Nuh-uh. I'm coming with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I told you no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I told you I'm coming with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Is that all you can say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'll follow you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's not any better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...Going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Now you're shortening it?! Sheesh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's too dangerous for you to go alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I can't take any soldiers with me. Greed Dike is occupying Wadatsumi so they won't let big groups through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, in that case, I'll just go instead. I've got nothing better to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Your availability has nothing to do with this! I'm trying to tell you that you'll just hold me back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'll put my life on the line for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't be a fool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We're talking about the island where demons dwell. Wadatsumi is already—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Sounds like fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power has manifested!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ooh, I'm getting chills!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ouch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Let me tell you a story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I can't wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If you've heard it before, just ignore me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This is a tale of Wadatsumi—an island steeped in corruption since ancient times—and its people, who were hunted by the demons that fed off of that corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It is negative emotions, such as hatred and sorrow, that give birth to corruption. The sludge of the world was as nourishment for the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hence, they found our Chakra—our Alchemia—all the more delicious the more corrupted it became.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Demons hunted humans for their own survival, devouring negative emotions and Alchemia both. Humans, in turn, would kill demons to save themselves from being eaten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The cycle of hatred and sorrow plunged Wadatsumi deeper and deeper into corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Amidst the chaos, a lone human man and a lone demon woman fell in love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Tired of fighting, the humans and the demons seized on that union as cause to make a pact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The desire for peace was mutual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The demons swore that they would no longer devour humans, and the humans vowed never to kill another demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>As proof of that oath, the demon broke both of her own horns. One of them, she made into a stone in which she could seal away her powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The other horn, she fashioned into a sword capable of exorcising demons, as a preventative measure against any misuse of demonic power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>A sword?! Was it...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>She called it Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Sumeragi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The humans also created a technique that could be used against demons—but kept it secret, only to be used in the event of true calamity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh! Oh! That's your...um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Your Kagutsuchi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Would you stop repeating everything I say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Would you stop repeating ev—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ouch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The Sacred Three: The Mikaboshi, Sumeragi, and Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Each was given to a powerful family of Wadatsumi to guard and manage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The Kagomurasaki Clan received the spirit stone, the Mikaboshi; Sumeragi, the sacred sword, went to the Black Star Clan; and the house of Rising Ashes took on the art of Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The two clans were the wings of the great phoenix that was the royal family—the house of Rising Ashes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Demons and humans went on to enjoy a time of quiet peace, mingling freely with one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>And so people with demonic lineage came to reside in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>So that's why it's known as the island where demons dwell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Now, some among the people are starting to awaken to their hereditary natures—as demons who feed off of corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Why wasn't that a problem until now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Well, in the past, they refused diplomatic relations. I'm sure they were dealing with their issues amongst themselves during all that time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>But thanks to Greed Dike's recent invasion, Wadatsumi is now being carried away on an unprecedented tide of corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Too much to be contained within the cradle, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The cradle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>There was one family who inherited a particularly strong demonic lineage from the first demon to ever lie with a human. They used their powers to absorb the corruption and protect the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>That is the Kagomurasaki family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The Kagomurasaki family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The cradle has now overflowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>First, the Mikaboshi was inundated, but now, not even Sumeragi is capable of ending the chaos, and the art of Kagutsuchi cannot affect it from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Not only the demonic blood, but also the collective consciousness of the world's corruption has manifested as the Discarnate Power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power was passed down to those of the Kagomurasaki line across generations, spanning all the way back to the very first demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It was sealed away, and the darkness in this world was thought to have been undergoing continual purification. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Full to the brim with corruption, it seems that it has now stirred within Yomi, the leader of the Kagomurasaki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Should it manifest completely, and begin to possess a consciousness of its own...it will likely mean the return of the Wadatsumi of ancient times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Endlessly coveting corruption, it will give rise to tragedy—only to devour it all and spew forth even fouler corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I suppose that even after being invaded by humans, it will be the demons that herald Wadatsumi's end, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I hear that the Discarnate Power was exorcised once, shortly after which its whereabouts became unknown, along with the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi was sealed for so long that its properties began to change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>It became something that craved hatred and sadness, upsetting peoples' emotions and feeding off of the corruption that followed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>In essence, it became a stone that gorges itself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>As if to fuel the greed of the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>It is even said that it appeared at a turning point in our corruption-laced history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Women, human and demon, fade easily. It's like a disease that hops between hosts without a care for who they are—whether they be demon, human, fool, or saint... It's not fair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>But this is my destiny... The destiny of my house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It's the atonement for our failure that I must put my life on the line for, if need be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I talked an awful lot just now, so do me a favor and just accept it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I'm trusting you with all of this information, so don't go around flapping your tongue about it, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>In any case, this has nothing to do with you. You're not strong enough, so you'll just get in my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Now be a good boy and stay put.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I see. So he was spirited away, so to speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Just moments after he died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>His body, together with the Discarnate Power inside of it, were stolen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>By the Shiba Senko.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>We didn't have the strength to chase after them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Immediately after that, we received a declaration of war from the Shiba Senko. The conflict broke out soon after—hence the pitiful state you see us in now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>We did all we could to drive them away and take back my brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I wonder...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Lady Kagura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>The Shiba Senko took Jin's body away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>However, wasn't the fact that Jin came to take on the Discarnate Power, and that you were forced to kill the leader of the Shiba Senko...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>All because of Greed Dike? At least, that's what it sounds like from everything you've said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I don't understand what their objective is. Could it be to draw you out, so that they can kill you? Or is it something else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Well, it would be just like that up-tight little general to send regular reports...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Perhaps she is involved after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>That's not possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Well, where is she then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>She said something about an urgent summons. The Greed Dike soldiers stationed in Wadatsumi were suddenly recalled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Well, well. Isn't that suspicious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>She told me...that she wanted to be my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Easy enough to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>She put her life on the line for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Perhaps that was just what she wanted you to believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Leafah isn't that crafty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>You can read it on her face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Her face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>She blushes. Whenever she pushes herself too hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>She's too busy trying to grow up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>We both are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>So you'll keep your faith even while growing up, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>She and you both?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Neither of us has many friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Lady Kagura?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>So you'll wait for her as long as it takes? Going on faith alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I'm used to waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Kinda impressive, that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I can't seem to get used to waiting, myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>That's not such a bad thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>You don't need to get used to it yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Lady Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Don't think I don't know why you're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>You are the last of the royal family of Wadatsumi, the house of Rising Ashes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>It is your destiny to destroy, conceal, and nullify the effects of the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Since the Discarnate Power has manifested, the Mikaboshi now lies beyond the realm of anyone's control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Of course, now that I have absorbed it, it cannot be removed from me. I'm sure you realize what that means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>However, there is something I must yet do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>I must mourn my brother, and return him to the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Would you be willing to wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Until I can do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>It is the law of my house, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>To break it would be unforgivable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Lady Kagura...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>I am no longer queen, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Y-you mean...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>I'll have to try my hand someday...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>But I suppose that doesn't mean I have to do it immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Th-thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>I'm waiting too, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>So I need to do what I can to make peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>I'm waiting for someone very dear to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Order! Order in the court!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Greed Dike Inquisition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Here, you will listen to the words of the accused and pass down your judgment. We await your impartial and sagacious decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Oh, b-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>I'm n-not a heathen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>General Leafah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>The duty of subjugating Wadatsumi was bestowed upon you, was it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>The result?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen! Heathen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Order! I will have order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>I-I'm innocent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>So say the guilty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>But...what are you saying I have done?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>What have you done, indeed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>I've been doing all that I can for the sakes of both Wadatsumi and Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Despite being branded an invader...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Despite being mocked by my subordinates as a little girl who couldn't possibly achieve anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Are you slandering the Greed Dike Army?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>N-no, of course not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>I have worked day and night in order to restore faith in our great nation as soon as possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Yes, your efforts have achieved much! Not only did they lead to the revolt of a faction within the Kagomurasaki, but also to the slaughter of the leader of the Shiba Senko!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>B-but the Shiba Senko are evil! They're trying to take over the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Yet it was you who colluded with Yomi in an attempt to gain possession of the Mikaboshi and use it against Greed Dike! Hence it is the opinion of the this court that you and the Kagomurasaki are the evil ones—heathens!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>That is nothing but a groundless rumor spread by the Shiba Senko! Yomi was powerless to contain the Mikaboshi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>You have no proof. There is no better indication of the truth than reality. Do you disagree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Furthermore, your accusations of the Shiba Senko are troublesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>But they are the true culprits!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>It is the opinion of this court that the Shiba Senko are Greed Dike's allies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>If you continue making such accusations, this will not end well for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Wh-what did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>Are you aware of the sickness plaguing Wadatsumi, known as Demon's Blood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>I-I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>That sickness was carried into Wadatsumi along with our invasion. It is thought to be a subspecies of Ogre Fever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>An abnormally high fever that continues for an extensive period of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>However, in reality, it is something different entirely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>The blood of demons runs through the veins of every single denizen of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>Meanwhile, the symptoms of the illness called Demon's Blood manifest in response to corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Our invasion was clearly what instigated this outbreak of Demon's Blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>What...are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>After the abnormally high fever passes, the afflicted becomes a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>They become monsters with terrible powers. Demons who spread yet more corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>The change is permanent. There does, however, exist a medicine, though its effects are only temporary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Death is the only true solution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>We are taught that Wadatsumi is a heretical land, plagued by evil ideas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>Evil ideas?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>We are taught that it is a land of fanatical heathenism and savagery, a land where violence is used to encourage adherence to tradition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>It is said that they will happily kill even their own blood for breaking tradition; just like you are trying to do now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>Their harsh traditions... Their unbreakable codes and their merciless punishments...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>Was the Demon's Blood behind it all?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>Considering the chaos caused by the manifestation of the Discarnate Power, the day in which every last denizen of Wadatsumi turns into a demon is not far off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>The entire country is doomed to be overrun by demons. Quelling them is an impossible task.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>Are you saying that you sent us on an impossible mission?! What was the point of trying to retrieve Sumeragi—of trying to suppress the Discarnate Power?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>It would have been most excellent if you had managed it...and perfectly fine even if you could not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>Why would you send our forces on a futile errand?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>You were merely sent as a sacrifice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>A s-sacrifice?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>Prominent members of the Shiba Senko have already made efforts to enter Greed Dike's good graces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>The lower-ranking members have not been made aware of this, and so have continued killing and propagating the corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>We will continue sending sacrifices into Wadatsumi until no enemies of the Shiba Senko remain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>We're...just sacrifices?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>We will continue to accelerate their transformation into demons, and when the time is right, we will unleash them upon Babel. In so doing, Greed Dike will reign supreme once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>N-no! That's...insane!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>We will do whatever is necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240</td>
<td>You seek atonement? An open country? The restoration of trust?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>241</td>
<td>That's what I've—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>242</td>
<td>It is far too late for such things. The world is well aware of the past deeds of our great nation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>243</td>
<td>Hence, we must arm ourselves, and with the strength of a continent, cull the world once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>244</td>
<td>So we will change nothing?! Learn nothing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>245</td>
<td>Oh, you young, ambitious, noble warriors...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>246</td>
<td>So unfortunate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>247</td>
<td>How noble of you not to return without completing your mission...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>248</td>
<td>Even if it meant sacrificing yourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>249</td>
<td>N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>250</td>
<td>General Leafah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>251</td>
<td>What is the meaning of this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>252</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>253</td>
<td>They are loyal to the heathen Leafah! The soldiers are rebelling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>254</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>255</td>
<td>We know better than anyone how much General Leafah cares about the wellbeing of this nation!</td>
</tr>
