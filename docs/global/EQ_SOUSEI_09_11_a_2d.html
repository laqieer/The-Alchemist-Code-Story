<td>Nimul has reached the others, I see.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Then all I have to do is wait for my cue, as arranged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The time to use it has come. Zafeiris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are you certain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Of course! That's the point of this whole journey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Very well. Fringe Dimensional Art, Nero. Extraction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It is time to impart the seven wonders upon he who knows the final fate of the dragons. If your body can handle them, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What price are you prepared to pay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>My sense of pain, to start with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Acceptable. Your offering shall be received.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>"Adhere to the dark commandments."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>"Fall to ruin."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This...power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Nice! A clean hit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Nn...gh... Gn...gh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(I've lost my sense of pain, and yet...this feeling of being torn apart...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(Is this what it means to come in contact with the Truth of the world? Have I misjudged the cost of standing on the same stage as Nimul? Was I even prepared to pay this price?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>How can you still be standing after that attack?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Why...do you have that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm merely borrowing it. Once I've settled matters here, I fully intend to return it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I don't understand. That shouldn't be possible! You... You have her power. You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Nrk... What? My strength is leaving me?! Ah, I see. The magil that sustains this body has run its course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tch! What an inconvenient physical form!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Your power doesn't even compare to that of your master, Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Of course not! Humans are imperfect creatures. Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's enough, Mesarthim.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Matia?! Why are you intervening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Because you've gotten clumsy, Mesarthim. Have you been having too much fun playing with these children?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Your biggest flaw has always been your inability to see the forest through the trees, as it were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You don't even know what you're saying. They're strong, Matia. Not individually, but as a group.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Are they? Well, if you say so. I suppose I'll just have to take your word for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Nonetheless, your defeat would be quite the problem right now, and I don't much care for babysitting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ha. I'd heard that you gave up your weapons before the end of your life and thought maybe you'd mellowed a bit, but it seems you must have had some second thoughts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You talk too much. When I said I don't care for babysitting, I wasn't talking about you. But maybe I should have been.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>She stopped it with a single hand?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Your swordsmanship isn't half bad. More promising than anyone else's I've seen since my transmutation, at any rate. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Nngah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Andechs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Gnrk... It's just a scratch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(What was that?! I didn't even see her attack!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I appreciate that you recognize us as the superior force, and even planned a surprise attack to compensate for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Sadly for you, your opponent is not so easily tricked!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hmph. I thought I'd grant you a moment to reflect on your failures here, but it seems you aren't interested in such niceties!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>How about one final tip before we...part ways? Regarding the proper means of using sephirah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We humans, plunged into the deepest depths of sin, having molded and consumed even the spirits themselves...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The magil here is changing again! Mira, we have to adjust our calculations, quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ulgh, such a pain! Sorry, everyone! We'll adapt as fast as we can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>And you think I'd be so generous as to grant you enough time for that?!</td>
