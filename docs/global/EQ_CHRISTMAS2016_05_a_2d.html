<td>Well then, I'll send the boy home. What will you do, Lofia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Since I've finished my mission, I'm heading home. I'm sure the other two will be back soon as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Very well. Get home safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You too, Michael. Take care of the boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hohoho! Of course! Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'll hurry home as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hm? Those voices...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Seriously! We couldn't find anything, even after coming all this way to Lustburg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But if there was such a prominent man—well, old man—in Lustburg, I'm sure he would be famous. It's already a female-dominated country, as it is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, Lofia! So you also wanted to look for Santa Claus after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You took too long to change your mind. We just decided to call it a day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You didn't find Santa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Did you know that Santa Claus is a story out of a picture book? What are all those eyewitness testimonies about anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Maybe he really is just a role played by fathers, and everybody remains silent so as not to destroy their children's dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sigh... I really wanted to meet him. By the way, Lofia, what are you doing in Lustburg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I was helping a lost child get home. I thought you two might still be here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh, I see... Do you want to search for him again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>U-um, ah, no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm exhausted. Besides, we didn't find any promising leads. Let's go back home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>A journey that yields neither blood nor new weapons is maddeningly worthless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>R-right. Let's hurry back home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If you want to hurry, let's take the shortcut that cuts through the forest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hold on. Look at this eerie black fog. I think there's a monster nearby.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh? Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Quick, run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh, Santa Claus?!</td>
