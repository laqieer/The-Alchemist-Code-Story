<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Everyone, get behind me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ngh! It's a lot stronger than earlier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are you okay, Naofumi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah, I'm fine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Its defense capabilities are through the roof. Everyone's attacks are barely leaving a scratch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Is it just me, or did its stats go way up since the last time we fought it? We're not going to get anywhere like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The only way we'll win is if we kill it in one go with the Iron Maiden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But Lord Naofumi... It takes a while to cast, making it easy to interrupt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm not sure if I'll be able to protect you from so many enemies for that long...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What are we going to do, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We'll take care of the rest of the monsters for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Forget about the small friesâ€”just focus on releasing that powerful attack of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No need to worry about us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Thank you, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(I didn't think it'd feel so reassuring to fight alongside so many other people besides Raphtalia and my usual crew...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(If I could team up with the other Heroes like this, we'd be...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Got something on your mind, Naofumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Not really... I'll let you guys take care of the monsters, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>All right... Come forth, Shield of Rage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Naofumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Lord Naofumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>

<td>Zweite Aqua Shot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Melty?! What on earth are you doing?! Step down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No, I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm the only one who can move right now... So I'll buy Naofumi some time. I refuse to be an inconvenience to him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hey, you! Come over this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>SYAAAAA!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Shield Prison!</td>

<tr>

<td>SYAAAAA!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Change Shield!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>SYAAAAA!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Within this virgin of cold ore, who shall swallow even your screams with her embrace, suffer in anguish as your entire body is stabbed and skewered! I cast the Iron Maiden!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>SYAAAAA!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The rift is closing... Thank goodness! The Wave's finally been suppressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>So we did it, then. Geez, what an ordeal that was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Sigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Lord Naofumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Are you all right, Naofumi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'm okay, as you can obviously tell. More importantly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You put yourself in so much danger, Melty! You could've gotten seriously injured!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry for making you worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I was just thinking of what I could do to help out... And then I jumped forward before I knew it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>My goodness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, you're definitely not the most adept soldier out there... But what I saw from you out there wasn't bad, not at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I could only do so because I had faith that Naofumi would protect me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You've really gained the trust of your companions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...Guess you could say that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Whoa! What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Does this mean we can return back to our world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Looks like it. I guess our time here's up. Thanks for your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>We should be the ones thanking you. You helped us protect our world. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'm sure you have a tough journey ahead, but do your best for those who believe in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'll try...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Thank you again for all of your help, Ryle, Lamia...and Anastasia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Melty... Don't push yourself too hard. A princess shouldn't be too reckless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Well... I must apologize to you in advance, then. I can't guarantee that I'll be able to keep that promise, but I will certainly do my best to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Oh, dear... If I was the knight assigned to protect you, I don't think having even nine cat lives would suffice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But even so... I wholeheartedly believe that there are things that only you'll be able to accomplish. I know you'll become a wonderful queen one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Thank you very much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>So please continue to do your best... And no matter how many hardships you face, please continue to push forward and live on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'll try my hardest... I may not be able to do much, but I'll definitely do everything in my power to help my kingdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>While there may not be anything that I can contribute right away... I'll never turn away from the obstacles ahead of me. I'm sure of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>As long as I don't give up, I know I'll be able to show myself and others just what it is that only I'm capable of accomplishing.</td>
