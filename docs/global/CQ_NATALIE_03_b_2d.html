<td>001</td>
<td>There we go. That's it for now. Make sure you don't hurt yourself more, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Thanks, Natalie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Thank you, Natalie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(Why was I reminded of Gerald just now?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Anyway, you're really amazing, Natalie! I mean, you can treat any wound!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>How long have you been doing this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Since I was a kid, Gerald... I mean, a childhood friend of mine would always get injured, so I would have to treat him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I didn't know you and Gerald were childhood friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Does that mean you're the one who has always treated Gerald's wounds?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh? Well, yeah, I guess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>With you always around to treat him, I'm sure Gerald never needs to worry about anything when he fights!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>He doesn't think that way. He just expects I'll be around. Like the air.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What?! How can you say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You've known each other since childhood and have fought together as knights in arms. He couldn't possibly take you for granted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>He knows you are integral for the Blue Flame's mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Budâ€¦</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>He must feel that way. If I were Gerald I'd be feeling thankful every day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I mean, he doesn't have to worry if he gets hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Not to worry? That's just nonsense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But seeing what you do made me think that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well, that's just stupid. Think about all those injuried and why I'm there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But then again, I treat everyone without a second thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We do need each other in a sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So if Gerald gets injured, I have to be right there to fix him up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>By the way, I've heard that dried Lizardman liver could be used for medicinal purposes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It probably tastes awful. When we return I think I'll test the effects on the Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You... You're going to test it on people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's necessary for scientific purposes, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If I'm going to be treating Gerald as he expects,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm going to need good medicine to make him well!</td>
</tr>
