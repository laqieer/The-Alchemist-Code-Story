<td>Seems like I used far too much of my purification power. However...I did manage to retrieve Beelzebub, so the risk was worth it in the end.</td>

<td>What in the world was that tentacle?</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm not sure. Maybe it was formed from the dragon's fixation with Beelzebub...? Or from its desperation to cling onto life...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's odd, though... We extracted Beelzebub. Shouldn't that weaken the dragon?</td>

<td>Jam?! No way! Didn't we purify Beelzebub?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...?! The dragon's chest is glowing a bright yellow now!</td>

<td>Do not falter! We must focus on crushing the enemy before us. That is all there is to it!</td>

<td>Georgios...how can you keep up in your condition? Dang it...it's just like he says! We'll just have to crush them!</td>
