<td>Lord Zangetsu, will you allow me to train with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Of course. That being said, traditional training is no fun. Come at me with everything you've got.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes, Sir! It's an honor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hyahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heh. It feels good to face a young and earnest sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(That being said...it's not enough. Is there no one who can truly challenge me?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(Is there no opponent who can raise my strength to new heights?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I will not allow you to say you've forgotten me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I've fought against you in the past, and you walked away without delivering the final blow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Right...I had let this person live with the belief that one day she would equal me in strength, and we could aim for complete domination together.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Heh. I welcome your visit, woman. Your stance has become quite impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I am grateful to see that you've crossed the underworld so that we may meet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I am no longer the same as I used to be. I will wipe that smile off your lips.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Enough talk. Advance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Lord Zangetsu, what are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We're at a good point. Don't get in the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>B-but a herd of monsters is approaching...and we've been asked to assist in a counterattack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmph. It can't be helped the. First, we fulfill our duty on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Wait, Zangetsu! Are you going to run away?!</td>
