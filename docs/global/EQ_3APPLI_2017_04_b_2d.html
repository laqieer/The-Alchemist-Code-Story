<td>I can hear the pain in everyone's voice again. They are fighting in the deepest part of my unconscious...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Is there nothing we can do? Even if it would be just to give them encouragement...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The one they are fighting is a sad, painful, and defeating emotion that clutches at their heart. It is...the darkness of the heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Because the sunlight has grown weak...the darkness of everyone's heart has increased. It may be too difficult to win now.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It can't be...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Normally it would be, but you have <p_name> as your captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td><p_name> should be able to bring light to everyone's heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The moment that Amaterasu proclaims this, the pirate hat that <p_name> is wearing suddenly emits a strange light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wh-what...is this?!</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Actually, that hat...was the same one that the captain of this pirate ship wore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Re-really?!</td>

<td>After the captain of this ship died...both the ship and the hat...</td>

<td>They continued to float in a world that was not really a world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>They were searching for someone to lead them once again on an adventure...someone worthy of inheriting this destiny...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh? Someone worthy of inheriting this destiny...? Are you saying that's me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yes. Your way of life mirrors that of the legendary pirate, after all...</td>

<td>Just like you have.</td>

<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Someone who can visit many worlds and become friends with the people there...that is the one who is worthy of wearing this hat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The person who can save these girls...can travel freely between worlds...without creating walls in their wake...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You are the only one who can make that hat glimmer!</td>

<td>If I am up against darkness...then I just need to shine light on it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Kohhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Legendary pirate, owner of this hat...share your power with me! Rescue Lisbeth from the darkness of her heart!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The moment that <p_name> screams this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Nothing happened...</td>

<td>Th-thank you...Lisbeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Captain...what're you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You were in pain, Lisbeth, so I wanted to do what I could to help you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...But you ended up saving me instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>No, you being here is so reassuring! You make me feel like there's hope, Captain! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We're friends! It's the least I can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Besides, it's not just us. Even in the continent of Babel, you have friends who will fight by your side, Lisbeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Um... Friends who will fight by my side...? Oh! The Phantom Soldiers!</td>

<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Go on! Rely on them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We are inside your heart, Lisbeth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>If you wish it hard enough, it truly is possible for you to borrow their strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'll lend you this pirate hat. It has the ability to collect the power of your friends. I'm sure you can do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That's only if you can wish it hard enough...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>In that case, I shouldn't have any problem!</td>

<td>Koohhhh... You...Liz...kohhh...come...die...with me...koohhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Even before everyone came to help...I knew you were a fake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But...when you talked to me with the face and voice of Mr. Ant...it made my determination falter...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But I'm fine now! I won't lose to a fake! Not here, not now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>If you were the captain, Shenmei...maybe the ship wouldn't arrive properly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Hey! Yeah, it would!</td>
