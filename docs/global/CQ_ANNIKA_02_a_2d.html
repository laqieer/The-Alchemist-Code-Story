<td>Argh! The hell? You're too damn strong! Tch, you'll pay for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No, we will not. This space is for everyone. There are no fees required.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Umm... You should be careful about what you take so literally. Payment doesn't always come down to money, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh. I was not aware of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Really? I lost customers thanks to all that ruckus. You've caused me a lot of trouble, lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're really something, you know that? Gah... I came all this way to find a present for Lizzy, and this is what I get?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Very well. I will help you find this thing that you are looking for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh? No way! You know what I'm looking for?! Do you know where it is?! Come on, tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You are searching for...a mushroom. Am I correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Wow! You got it! It's a super rare type of fungi called the Phantom Mushroom! How did you know? I never said a word about it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Your eyes kept scanning the ground. It was obvious what you were looking for. The Phantom Mushroom... Hmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Be still. I will test the flow of energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It appears that this mushroom grows only in a dangerous wood, in the depths of which lurks a nest of beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Aw, really? I don't think I've ever been there before. I'd feel a little uneasy going on my own...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh! I know! Why don't you come with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hahah! As if, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I will go with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I mean, we only just met, and... Huh? Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes. I will accompany you. Shall we get going, Margaret?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh! Yes! Thank you, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I am called Annika. It is my pleasure to have become acquainted with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's a pleasure to meet you, too! I really appreciate this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>By the way, Margaret... You mentioned that this is to be a present, but what will the mushroom be used for? I do not recommend the consumption of it. It is not tasty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hahah! Don't worry about that! It's for this new medicine Lizzy's making.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It hasn't been an easy journey, coming all the way out here to Saga; but so long as I can make Lizzy smile, it'll all be worth it in the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You are well blessed, Margaret. Having one you care about so dearly must be happiness itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>However, your sun energy is too strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This is not a bad thing, but do you not often find yourself charging recklessly into things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>W-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Sometimes, in order to best use our powers, we must first rest, or hold back and watch. Please take care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Eheheh... I'll be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So, um, Annika... Why did you agree to come with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You wear almost as little cloth as I do, so I feel a certain kinship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Really? That's the only reason?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You're...kinda weird, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Do you not find it vexing when people tell you that you ought to wear more?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh? No one's ever said that to me before! Everybody seems to love my outfit just the way it is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I see... Well, your aura is a strong and brilliant one. It would be a shame to cover it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Aw, shucks! You think so? Thanks! I'm not sure I'd call what you're wearing clothes, exactly, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Your accessories and those patterns on your skin are really pretty! I think it's great that you're showing them off for the world to see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Thank you! I am glad to know that someone agrees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I am better able to sense the flow of energy and taste the seasons upon my skin the more I show of it. Remaining in this natural state also allows me to preserve the sanctity of my being. To don cloth would be to dirty myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Though it would only weaken my powers, those who cover themselves habitually entreat me to do the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well, I think you look great! You don't need to change yourself to please them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Margaret...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>So don't back down, no matter what they say! You've gotta stay true to yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I have never heard anyone speak such an opinion before! I am pleased! Margaret, when we return, let us bathe together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh? Isn't that a little sudden? We only just... Well, I guess I don't really mind...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Good! Let us get on with finding this mushroom, so that we may hurry back and enjoy ourselves. Now, I believe it should be somewhere around here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oh! Hey, Annika, isn't that it over there? It looks just like the one in the drawing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wait. There are beasts nearby, but they should return to their nest come nightfall. We should wait until then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ahhh! No! It's going for the mushroom! Hey! Bad dog! I need that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hold, Margaret! You must wait!</td>
</tr>
