<td>Crap, we gotta get outta here! This chick's crazy strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>And don't forget "beautiful."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What the...Laiya, that was amazing! Your strength is incredible! So cool! Are you some sorta knight or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Not quite. I used to be a fighter in the Gluttony Foss Colosseum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Colo...sseum?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's somewhere you can rely on your own strength. But once I fought my way to the top, I... I couldn't take the pressure, and I ran.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But now I feel like I'm being blown this way and that. Your flowers, though, they're so firmly rooted in place. It's as if they were calling out to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tell me, how is it that you are able to give your all for the sake of these flowers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh? I-I guess it's because they're so pretty. I just like them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You like them...because they're pretty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...I'm going to be the best! Not just the strongest, but the prettiest too!  I'll be the cutest, strongest girl you've ever seen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hey, don't laugh! I'm not some kid, ok?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No, that's not it at all. You just remind me of my protege, is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You know what you like and what you want, and you don't let anything get in your way. She's the same way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...Ah, that must be it. It's because you're following your own path that you're able to give it your all. Both of you. That's what lets you shine so brightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Your protege? So what's she like?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Her name is Shayna. She has the strength to defeat any foe, and the looks to win over any man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>She's a star as dazzlingly strong as she is cute... There really is no other way to describe her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wow, Shayna sounds incredible! I can tell how much you care for her, Laila.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...! Of course I do! After all, I'm her number one fan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well I guess you'll be heading off to see her then, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I...I suppose you're right. After all, I'm acting on my own now. Why shouldn't I go see her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But...is it really alright for me to see her as I am now? I still feel this emptiness inside me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>C'mon, what are you talking about? When there's something you want, you just have to go for it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I see... Freedom is more than freeing your body. It means the freedom to be true to your feelings...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...I've made up my mind. I'm going to Envylia next. To see Shayna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Are you sure? All the way to Envylia? That's pretty far...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I know, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's...what I want to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...Wow, if only you could see your face right now, Laila. You're beaming like the sun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I am. Strong and beautiful...as the sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And while the sun may set for today, it will rise again, as brilliantly as the blossoms of your flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, may we meet again, erm... I don't think I ever got your name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's Mielikki!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Well then, may we meet again, Mielikki. I'll be sure to include you in the tales of my travels I tell to Shayna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I doubt she'll believe I met someone so much like her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Thanks! And be sure to give her my best!</td>
