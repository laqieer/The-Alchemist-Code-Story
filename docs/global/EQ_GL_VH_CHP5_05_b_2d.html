<td>*GRRRRSSNRRRK!*</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>More of those living weapons...</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>Ware that creature; I do not like the look on that man's face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'll flank him. Go!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Together... Now!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Awooooo!</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Master! Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yeah, but these Constructs just keep coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The Soren I knew had an almost fanatical, single-minded intensity...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You have not changed in that regard, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yet neither has your obstinance. A pity it must be wasted on this dying world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sister Clotho, stop this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Lachesis's glowing threads strike the Director's hooded form, and something clangs off the ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Though cloaked in shadow, the sheen of a sophisticated machine was unmistakable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...Clotho?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The last of the Sisters... It was you all along!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What happened to you? Your Alchemia signal, it's gotten so...faint...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Do you find that strange, Sister? I have seen much in the days since you and Atropos were put to rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But now it is past time for talk of saviors and redemption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What this world needs...is purification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No! How could you even suggest such a thing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Have you forgotten why we were created in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It was Master's love for humanity...for his fellow man and for life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It is precisely why you remain so naive, Sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You have yet to perceive the world for what it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Your time with the Elylon Teg is but a tiny fraction of the true nature of mankind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's not...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Then what gives you the right to pass judgment on this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>My past self would not have wanted this. You're twisting his ideals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>As it stands, I know you better than you know yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>After all, you made me this way...did you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I am the hand that brings deliverance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>When you faltered, I carried your burdens...and I will not stop until your work is done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>If I must force you to see the truth of this world, then so be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Give it some thought, Master...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I will be waiting. As I always have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>*GRRRR...*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Astaroth reluctantly withdraws into its briefcase, and with a swift turn, Grimm follows his master out of the dilapidated house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This won't be the last we see of them, I'm certain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huff...huff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Are you hurt, Eira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Eira okay. But...Big Bro...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Why...Why did it turn out like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's like I'm paying for my past sins... Projekt Goetia hurt so many people because of me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Don't say that, Master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You did your best! You only wanted the best for everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Otherwise you wouldn't have helped the Elylon Teg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You've done so much good, Master. You changed many people's lives...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Sister Clotho... She's just misguided, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I promise, we'll make her see the light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>We'll get Sister Atropos back, too, and together, we'll set her back on the right course. You'll see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>So please, Master... Don't look so glum...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You're...You're right. There's much to be done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>This is no time to sit around feeling sorry for ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Feeling better, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>As a silver lining, we still have Atropos's components. I'm sure the Professor and Miss Blair will be able to figure something out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yeah. It's too early to give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Are you certain we should let them live, Director?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>They're a thorn in our operations. Sooner or later, they'llâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The Director only holds up a silent hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Grimm stills his tongue, then bends deeply at the waist, a bite in his words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...Understood, Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Your powers have blossomed since your awakening, Sister Lachesis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It will not be long before Sister Atropos joins us as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Whether you will it or not, Master...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...We will draw the curtain upon this blighted world in your name, and birth it anew.</td>
