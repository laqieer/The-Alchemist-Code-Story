<td>It's getting cold. Are you okay? You must be hungry. Here, eat this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's good chocolate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(I thought I would be able to meet up with the ladies...but it seems like it'll be difficult.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>This is so delicious! Can I take half home? I want my sister to eat some too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes, of course! How about we rest a little...huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Aah, monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh no... We're surrounded! Don't get separated from me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oooh! It's Santa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hohoho! Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Santa! I have a request! I want my sister to...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Okay, calm down, son. Tell me slowly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Mich...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lofia...shhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>............</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There's no way I would miss the house of a child who's been behaving. Don't worry now. Go to sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Thank you...Santa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes. That's a good boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>He's fallen asleep. He must have been nervous all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. He's a good boy who cares about his sister. I'll carry him back home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That said...I never expected you to be Santa, Michael.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I never thought you'd find out, Lofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hey...how long has Santa been part of Lustburg's culture?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>An intuitive question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Santa Claus wasn't part of Lustburg's history until recent years. I researched that once in the Royal Library.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hm. Very impressive, Lofia. Well then, have you considered that Santa Claus may be from a different world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes. On rare instances, a castaway from another world can enter into Babel through the Door of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I learned about Santa Claus from such an individual from a different world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I began playing the part to make my granddaughter Alyu smile after her parents had just died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So you really are the founder of Santa then, Michael.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>After that, I began to deliver presents to underprivileged children throughout the land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Even after I became a phantom, my will was carried on by the Holy Order and they continued to summon me as Santa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Why go to that extent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>For an old man like me, nothing is more important than bringing smiles to the faces of promising youths and children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(Wow, Michael.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hoho... Keep this a secret between the two of us, Lofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ah, monsters again. Do your best for the boy, Santa Claus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hohoho. Very well then.</td>
