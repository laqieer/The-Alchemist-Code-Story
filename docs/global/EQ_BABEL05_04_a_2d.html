<td>You're joking, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Do I look like I am joking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You want me to be captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Do you not think you're suited for the job?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>So this is your way of trying to persuade me to stay, is it? Is that all you've got, captain of the 2nd Regiment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Nobody else can surpass your skill with Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Besides you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What was it you said? Ah, yes. "Alchemy can only make imitations, and never anything genuine."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Even my excuses sound genius, don't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Have you tired of the Holy Guard? Is that it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I just realized that my mind is better put to other endeavors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What would become of Albea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>She can do as she wishes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, this is depressing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Come closer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What? Is this secret only for the boy's club?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's a very radical secret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>All I can do is look the other way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's unbecoming of you, Observer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Even I can go along with schemes when it suits me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I choose to do so with this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Magnus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I've never been able to keep secrets from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I don't even want to keep secrets from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You about to expose some shocking truth to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I hid my uniform under my bed in the barracks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's yours now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Why the heck would I want that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Keep it as a memento.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>A what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>They'll be coming for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm gonna make myself scarce before they can get to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>If you choose to stay here 'til your dying days, then do what you will with my uniform.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I said I don't want it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>However, if you ever have any doubts about the Holy Guard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If you're willing to risk your life for the chance to see something totally insane, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Then...? What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well, just know that you can hide a lot in a coat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Magnus left the Holy Guard, leaving no indication as to where it was he was heading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>All contact with him was lost, and then...it came.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It came as quite a surprise to all when Kaya resigned from her position as captain of the Holy Guard's 2nd Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Far more surprising, though, was the fact that shortly afterward, she disappeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The Crimson Dragon, possessor of the Alchemia Pura, vanished overnight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Not a single trace of her could be found. Not even by the Lord Commander himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It was enough to spark suspicions and pique my interest in the dealings of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Farthest corner of the library...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Bottom row, eleventh book from the right, page eight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hold Magnus' uniform in one hand and recite the password.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Showdown!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Whoa...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The page is...rewriting itself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>The Alchemia that Magnus wove into his uniform served to activate some sort of mechanism, so that his research notes emerged before my very eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I read about how Magnus had begun researching the Alchemy Source in order to perfect his Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I learned that the Alchemy Source could somehow be connected to the Cursed Beasts, which once existed long ago on the continent of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I learned of Magnus' suspicions that the Holy Guard had concealed certain aspects of history related to Alchemy for unjust and monopolistic reasons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I read his detailed notes on the existence of Corpse, the dark side of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It didn't take long for me to decide to leave the Holy Guard after that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I had mottos aplenty to live by. A whole list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>One of my favorites was, "A wise man never courts danger."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Though I have to admit, I do love the thrill of danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Now maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I always wanted to try my hand at living off the grid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I tip my hat to you, Magnus. You were willing to do what it took to eradicate any mark of corruption from the supposedly upright and pure Holy Guard, no matter how small.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What'll it be? Will I let the flow of this river take Will where it will?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Oh, that's a good one. I'll add it to my list.</td>
