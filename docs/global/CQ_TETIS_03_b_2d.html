<td>Ugh! You better believe I'll be back! You'll regret this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Milis, are you hurt? I didn't think this would become such a ruckus...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm totally fine! Jeez, that guy was such a butt. I can't believe he grabbed you like that! He even called you a monster! Were those eyes in his head just for show?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hmph. As if any disciple worth their salt could just sit back and let someone treat their master like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>By the way, is your gracefulness because of—you know—the whole mermaid thing? Do you have any tricks you can teach me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You must have understood by now, but I'm not the kind of woman that anyone thinks particularly...highly of. I'm sure there are others out there who are far more suitable to teaching you what you want to learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Who cares what they think?! I don't know them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Milis... You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I want to be just like you, Miss Tethys! You're exactly the kind of lady I'd love to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Milis... You say that, but I'm actually quite jealous of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?! Seriously?! Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You possess many wonderful qualities that I do not, such as candor, kindness, earnestness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I think that there is much more that I could learn from you than I myself have to teach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Milis, this disciple thing is a bit much for me. What do you think of just being...friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What?! Miss Tethys, you... Well, I guess I should just call you Tethys, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Tethys, we're already friends! Anyone who's eaten a meal together with you is a friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Milis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Next time a lame buttface like that guy shows up, I'll definitely be there to kick their butt for you again, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(Ever since I was a child, whenever anyone said something mean to me, Perez would come to my rescue. Perez said the same kind of thing back then, too.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(To be able to just shrug off other people's opinions like that...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(I suppose Perez and this girl are a little similar in that respect.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmhm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wow! You look even lovelier when you smile! How do you do that? Do it again! Can you teach me how to do that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Cause, I mean... We're friends, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes, of course. Anything for a friend. Hm... I suppose we'll have to start with etiquette lessons. Of course, I will have to lend you one of my dresses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh? Dresses? Uh... But I'm, like, all sweaty from the hunting, and I don't want to get your clothes dirty, so, uh... Let's just forget the dress thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There's no reason to be shy! Why don't we head back to my place and you can clean up and change there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Usually I don't allow anyone but Perez into my room, but I'll make a special exception for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>After all, you're my very precious, second-ever friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm sure the two of us will become very close!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yesss! All right! Thanks, Tethys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh! I'm sorry, but no hugs! I'm only telling you this because you are my friend, and I want you to understand. I don't like being touched. I only allow it if I have some time to prepare myself first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What?! Aw, man! Fine... But be prepared for next time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh, right! In celebration of our newfound friendship, I'll treat you to some water lizard dishes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What? Erm... Lizards, you say? I... Well, if that's what you want, Milis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Of course! It's delicious! Especially when roasted whole. Mmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Urk... Milis, I... I am afraid that I might have to respectfully decline...</td>
</tr>
