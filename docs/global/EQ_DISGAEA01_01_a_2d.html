<td>...Lia...salia...Usalia...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...What?! I'm not asleep! I was looking into the Carbon Dioxide Reduction Proposal, plip! ...Wait, what's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What's gotten into everyone, plip?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>*Sigh* Are you serious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Li'l Usa...don't you remember? We ran out of curry and you started going super berserk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Exactly! Thanks to your rampage, my pocket Netherworld is in shambles!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Then, you used the Dimension Gate to run off somewhere, so we chased after you, dood. We've just finished feeding you curry, dood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ohh... I-I'm really sorry for inconveniencing all of you, plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No...actually, if anyone is to blame, it's me. I misjudged how long it would take to stew the centaur tendons in the curry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Who would've thought centaur tendons were so tough! Oh...the humanity!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Anyway. Usalia looks like she's fine, so let's hurry on back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...Oh? What's this? Umph! Hey! Open, right this second! I command you to open now! Gahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hey, what are you doing? Super hurry up and open it, Sera.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Shut up, you muscle-brained monkey! I don't need the likes of you to tell me what to do! Come on! Uff! Hyuuuuh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...It doesn't open?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Urghhhhh! Seriously! Those Dimension Prinnies are gonna get a tongue-lashing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...By the way, what is this place? I've never seen a Netherworld like this one before, plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yeah, that reminds me! When we were wandering through the Dimension Gate, some jabroni named Uroboro...something was going on about Alche...something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What was all that about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's Ouroboros and Alchemy, plip. Why do you always skip the final syllable?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Alchemy...like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yip, yip! Are you the ones who called me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>My name's Rin! Nice to meet all of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Whoa! What the...fox?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...So, this is Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Miss Rin, my name is Usalia, plip. What is the name of this Netherworld?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Netherworld? This is the Continent of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...I remember Ouroboros saying something about how we're responsible for "entangling the Dimension Gate with the Door of Truth."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>En...tangling...? As in engaging in battle...? Oh! That explains why I'm dressed differently than usual! But this outfit also suits me pretty darn well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Entangling...? Is that some super kind of warfare?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Why does everything always have to be so violent with you, dood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I guess that means...this isn't our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...Come on! I've got no signal on my phone! And the Gate is giving me some serious attitude problems!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hold on...are you telling me we can't get home?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yeah, pretty much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I can't believe this! I've got to get back to my mission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What?! Are you all going home?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yeah...we've gotta get back to our own world, plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I feel so lonely...and I was so excited about making new friends...sob.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well, it doesn't look like we're leaving any time soon, so we can be together for now, plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But...you're leaving eventually, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yeah, but... Oh, I have an idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>While we're here, let's find Miss Rin some other new friends, plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What...?! Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Really, plip. If you have friends, you won't be lonely, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yeah! I wanna become friends with a lot of humans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Alrighty! Leave it to me, plip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Usalia...are you sure it's okay to make that kind of promise, dood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yeah, Li'l Usa. Why are you helping out that fox?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well...being alone...can be really painful, plip. I've experienced that pain before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hm...mmm... We-well, Red Magnus is super okay with being alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Either way, if we're gonna find a way to get back, we'll have to traverse this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Traverse...? Why, Sir Killia? If we wait here, we'll eventually...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The curry I just gave to Usalia was the last of my ingredients.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What...?! Then if we run out of curry again, Li'l Usa is gonna go berserk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yeah. That's why we'll need to procure ingredients.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That'll be a handful to deal with if she goes berserk now, dood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Sigh... Oh well, looks like we've got no other option. Prinny, carry me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Huh?! Madam Overlord, I can't carry you on my own, dood! You're too heavy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Yikes! I take it back, Madam Overlord. I'm sorry, dood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>All right...let's go, Miss Rin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Yup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>If I can kidnap and sell that thing, I'll be able to make a lucrative profit...heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Hey, how far are we gonna walk? I'm exhausted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>We're almost there! I'm pretty sure the village is right over that hill!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>If we can find the curry ingredients and the fox's friends, we'll have super achieved our goal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hold on. What're those?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Those are...Phantom Soldiers?! Why are there so many of them? They've surrounded the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Please, everyone! Help save the village! I'm begging you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hold on. You know we're demons, don't ya? Saving people from jabronies who aren't even the Lost sounds like a super hassle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>For once, I agree with this muscle-brained monkey. As for the ingredients we need for the curry, we can find them in another village...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Don't say that...please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Miss Rin...I understand! I'll fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Oh, miss! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Unbelievable! What kind of un-demonic melodrama are you spewing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Just so you know, the rest of us are continuing on ahead. Say something to her, Sir Killia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...Um, Sir Killia, what are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I'm eating an Orc Cutlets Rice Bowl. Sorry, but that was the last of it. There's none left for the rest of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What's on the menu is the least of my concerns right now. Why are you eating?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...I'm refueling myself before battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>So, you're gonna fight?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Yeah. Even if we're not up against the Lost, if someone is suffering, I can't turn a blind eye to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You're the best, Killia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Sir...thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Tsk. Oh well...if Killia is up for it then Red Magnus is in as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Come to think about it, I've been wanting to lay the smackdown on some random jabronies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>This'll ensure that the Overlord of Scorching Flame is super remembered throughout the entire Continent of Ba...something. Bwah-hahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You even forgot the name Babel, dood?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Are you serious? I absolutely refuse to do something that won't even gain me a single HL!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>...Um, Madam Overlord? Are you okay, dood? Everyone's already left, dood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Wha...ahhhh! You've gotta be kidding me! I will not be left unattended! Wait for me, Sir Killia!!!</td>
</tr>
