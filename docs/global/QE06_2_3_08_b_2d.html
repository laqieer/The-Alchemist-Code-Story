<td>Captain Tanosuke… Are my eyes playing tricks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Her strikes are like bolts of lightning! They're so fast I can't even see her unsheathe her sword...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yeah, I can barely follow it either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How can she be so fast wielding two blades…? Is it the way she draws her swords...? There must be something to it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>My technique is unrelated to swordsmanship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...It is the vulgar artifice of an assassin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Incredible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…You're quite the nuisance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's why we set up this ruse and had me leave the Blade Fox Corps, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…Let's save that talk for later, Jubei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>By all means!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Escape while you can, Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Amane! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>…You meddlesome wretch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>My blade is a demon slashing blade…but you are not its main target.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>In order to dispatch the true "demon," I wield this blade in the shadows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>…What are you implying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You can't possibly be unaware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>…I have no interest in your blathering. My sole purpose is to be king and make Wadatsumi a kingdom of demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>…So long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>…Miscreants--every last one… You're there, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I was wondering what happened. You had high hopes for that girl… To think she managed to escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Confound it! If you were watching, you could have aided me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Demons operate by their own code, do they not? I don't have a part to play in this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Are you just an all-seeing god? Is this not all your doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Not at all. All is for the future of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…Always disappearing so suddenly-- You think you can just manipulate us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, if you are the artist, I am the brush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I won't allow you to do as you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>*Pant* *Pant* What happened to--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's okay, she'll catch up soon enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>…Sorry I'm late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ah! When did you--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>…Fast as ever, Jubei. Thanks for your help back there. We owe you one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No need to thank me. I was tracking the demons' movements anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Er…well, we're deeply indebted to you! My name is Amane and--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Introductions are unnecessary. I heard about you from Lady Celis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I can't always be around to assist you... Be on guard… Both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wait! Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We have chosen different paths. It should not matter where I go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Now that I know what we're dealing with…we must go our separate ways in order to reach the true "demon."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The true "demon…"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>In any case, you are not my enemies... I'm sure we'll meet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>…Do you ever plan on coming back? I'm sure now--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I am a "traitor" who killed her comrade. My return would just cause trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You killed…your comrade--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ah…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>…I'll explain it all later. Let's head back for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>…To where we belong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>…Alright.</td>
</tr>
