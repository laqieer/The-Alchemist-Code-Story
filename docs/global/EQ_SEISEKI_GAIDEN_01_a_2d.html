<td>001</td>
<td>I knew it... It's just like I thought. This...is a record of a war fought in the distant past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>If this is true, it's a discovery that ought to be written into the history of Alchemy. Mm... I'm going to investigate this some more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Kaya...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This part is interesting. Don't disturb me, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Kaya, bout with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I must surpass you, Kaya, and give you a proper send-off toward your new path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is the resolution I have come to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Heh heh. You're tactless, you know that? And you're as clueless about women as ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You really are a chivalrous fool...and a blockhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I do like that look in your eyes. Allow me to test your resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I suppose this is a good spot for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Nn...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This is unusual for me...but I won't hold back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Come to think of it...this is our first bout, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If you let your guard down, you won't get off lightly. You do realize that my Alchemia is of an irregular class, do you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I possess Alchemia on par with the Sephira... "Alchemia Pura".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That is exactly why you're worth defeating. I will surpass you, here and now, as both your Lord Commander and as an old friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Kaya...as you set out on your new path, this is my parting gift to you! For I am a bastion of absolute justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>There's that fire of yours. If you truly are capable of shouldering the justice of Babel, then come... Show me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The Holy Guard, who administer justice in Babel. Shortly after the tenth Lord Commander is appointed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This is the untold record of the days of the Lord Commander's youth, inscribed into a Philosopher's Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Sacred Stone Memories</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Before daybreak. At the Gates of Sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Um... Lord Zain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What is it? Why is your face so red?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Lord Zain... I've always adored you! Please...allow me to stay by your side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What...? A-always?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes, always! And I want to remain with you, to be forever by your side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>With me..forever... Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, so please... Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I see! I'm incredibly moved!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>So then...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes! Of course! It is reassuring to know that you will always be by my side. I thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We are comrades, fighting side by side to uphold justice in Babel! I'm counting on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No, wait, that's not what I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No... Never mind. Please...forget I said anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Why do you look so sad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Lord Zain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Othima? Oh, and you, too, Monzein... Was something I said to her strange just now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>A little, Lord Zain. You can be a bit...clueless...about women, at times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What? I don't think his response was strange at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hush, Monzein! A fuddy-duddy like you will just make things worse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What did you say to me?! You little...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Just drop it and be quiet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I see... I wronged her without even realizing it. I must go and apologize immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wha—?! What are you doing, Othima? Unhand me! I must apologize to her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You can't! It will have the opposite effect! Monzein, don't just stand there! Help me out here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Why should I? There's nothing wrong with apologizing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Argh, you two don't understand women at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hmph. If you insist, then I suppose I had better not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oh man... The perfect Lord Zain's only flaw...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>By the way, Monzein... Have you heard from Kaya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yes... Lady Kaya will step down from her rank as Captain of the 2nd Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>If she told even you that, then I guess she must be serious about it. I was hoping that she was just playing a trick on me. Where is Kaya now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Actually, about that... There was a note on her desk. Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm setting off on a new journey. Don't come looking for me, okay? If you do, you'll get hurt. I'll return my coat of arms the next time we meet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Is this all? That woman...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>She was talking excitedly about some new ruins that she discovered recently. I assume that's where she's gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ruins again... I have no choice but to follow and persuade her to not to leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Frankly, losing Lady Kaya will strike a blow to the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>There's a reason why she's called the Crimson Dragon. Not only does she possess an incredible amount of Alchemia in her body, the "Alchemia Pura"...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>But many have said that her extensive knowledge, combined with her skill in battle, make her superior to the previous Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I already knew Lady Kaya was incredible, since we are in the same regiment, but to hear such praise coming from you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Well, I know I wouldn't feel confident taking on someone like her, with her encyclopedia of knowledge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Besides, isn't Lady Kaya an old friend of yours, Lord Zain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That's right. Both as friend and as Lord Commander, her resignation as Captain hurts me deeply.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>For now, I suppose I must go to these ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Thank you. I am sorry, but I will be unable to go with you. I have my duties in the 2nd Regiment to attend to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I'm rather busy myself. I think you're the only one who could convince her anyway, Lord Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Alright then. Leave it to me. Return to your duties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>(That being said, I'm not sure even I can do this. It's times like this that I wish I could call on Cadanova for help.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>(I have no idea what Kaya's thinking... Does that mean I really don't understand women?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>(This isn't good enough.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>(I can't save the women of Babel if I don't understand them!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>(I will convince Kaya to stay, no matter what, and I will become a Lord Commander who can save all in need of help!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Oh, Lord Commander!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You... You're the one who stood against Zahar at the graduation trial... Kanon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>(She's the one who witnessed Cadanova's end.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Oh, oh my goodness! For the Lord Commander to remember my name... I am so honored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You don't need to be so nervous...and you can just call me Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Ah... Yes, Lord Zain, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>(I sense something like a shard of light from within her...but I don't think she is yet aware of its existence.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>(I wonder what would happen if she met Kaya.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Is something the matter, Lord Zain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Kanon, I have a task for you. I will join you later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>A...task? To receive a task from Lord Zain himself... I am so honored! Where am I going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>There are some ruins I want you to visit. The Captain of the 2nd Regiment...the Crimson Dragon...Kaya. She should be there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Lady Kaya...? At the ruins...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>That's right. I'll join you later. I'm counting on you, Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Hmmm... This mural is even older. An enormous...beast? What could this possibly mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Could this be...the Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>There is a blank period in the history of the Holy Guard... A small piece of that might lie here, and if it does...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>This is a greater discovery than I had expected. I need to leave my post as Captain as quickly as possible, so that I can reach the truth behind this mural.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Ooh, this is so exciting. Now then...what do you have to show me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I finally found you! Lady Kaya! Ah... Oh... Oh nooooooo!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Ow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Just who are you? That was quite a noisy entrance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Right now, I'm trying to begin some very important research, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Oh, I'm sorry! My name's Kanon! I'm a new recruit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>The gods only know why, but I assume the gist of it is that Lord Zain told you to bring me back to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Wha—? How did you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Hm? Oh. You're that girl... The one who did so well in the final trial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>If the Order has members like you, then I am certain that I am no longer needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>It is you who should support the Holy Guard from here on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>That's why Cadanova gave you that sword...isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Wow! You know so much about me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>There's not a single person in the Order who doesn't know who you are at the moment, Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>The Flame Dragon King himself told you that, didn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Hm, yes... I am curious about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Heheh, this isn't like me at all, but since you're here, I will give you some personal training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Don't just stand there... Come on, get ready. You don't want me to change my mind, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>But...there's no reason for us to fight, Lady Kaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>So you need a reason... Let me see... In that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Allow me to test whether you are capable of wielding Cadanova's sword and continuing his legacy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I guess she was hurt by Lord Zain's comment, after all...</td>
</tr>
