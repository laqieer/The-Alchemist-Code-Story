<td>Then answer me, Godwolf. Will I be able to liberate my people from sin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Can I remake this world?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They who do not stoke the fires of their will have no choices in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If thou hold'st fast to thine will and thine might, it may be...possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>My powers...can free us from sin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Alas, should the fires of thine will flicker, in mere moments the flames would spread...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And in all likeliness devour the very world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This world would crumble under the weight of new sins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Nimul... The future that awaits is thine to determine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(With this new technique...I will obliterate sin from the face of this world!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Chief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What is it, Waginau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You have guests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Sup, Chief!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Adaleigh...and Yna. What are you two doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I came to thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>To thank...me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>And I was thinking of setting out soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, maybe not that soon. Not, like, right now. It's just that Yna here said he wanted to come with me, so I've started thinking about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The blade on which I am currently working will soon be complete. Once it is forged, I will accompany Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So you're leaving, too, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I am interested in learning more about the metal processing techniques of the Acedia Belt Region, and discovering for myself the materials that can be found there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I wish to broaden my horizons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It'll probably be another tough journey—but at least I know I can come back now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And I'll be back, for sure! So make sure you complete that new technique of yours before then, yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>There's no question about it. That is the power that will reshape this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Right. I'm going to improve the Engineer Soldier; make it stronger than ever. Then, together we can—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes. We will make this world a better place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(Nimul and Adaleigh... Working together, they might really be able to change this world.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes...? What is it, Yna? Surely you don't need to bid me farewell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Why do you detest me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I am asking you why you detest me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hmph. It is easy for a wanderer like yourself to abandon this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I am sworn to protect the people of this village and their chief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I simply don't have the time or the patience to spare for someone like you. That's all there is to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I knew it. It must be you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh? I have no idea what you're talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>H-hey! Yna! Don't you walk away from me! Hmph. What a wretched man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Lady Emmel...? The Godwolf Ceremony was concluded safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So... Please don't look so glum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'm not sure I agree. Can we be sure everything is fine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>My brother might have been made chief, and my bond with Sephiron and her powers has, indeed, been rekindled...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But... Oh, Nimul. What was he thinking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Did he really mean all that? What he said about...changing the way of the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Lord Nimul... Ever since he was a child, he has seemed focused on things faraway, distant from this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I cannot claim to understand anything that he was thinking, but there is one thing I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yes...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>He would never do anything that would bring you suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Really? How do you think I felt during the ceremony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>He disrespected the avatar of our guardian deity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I was terrified that he would bring divine wrath down upon himself... No, upon all our people. I felt like my heart was going to burst in my chest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Despite all that, he's now our chief. He needs to prove himself dependable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Not only to spare Waginau the trouble, but also...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>For your sake, Julia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>L-Lady Emmel! As I have said, I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Lady Emmel...? Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Aahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Stay back, my lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Identify yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Lila?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What have you done to them, you fiend?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Wh-why would you do something so terrible? What could you possibly hope to achieve?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Answer her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I do this for the sake of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You...are the Vessel of Purification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You...will be next.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Lady Emmel! Run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Julia! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>M-my lady... Leave this to me! You must...run...now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>B-but I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You won't escape me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ngh... Hrngh! This power...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Run, my lady! Flee! Before it is too late!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>C-come with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I cannot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I cannot protect you and fend off this fiend at the same time. He is far too powerful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Hurry, my lady! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Be safe, Julia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Have no fear. I will not allow myself to be so impotent as to abandon my duty before I have seen it done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You're not going anywhere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaaahhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Out of my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I won't...let you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>How did you get here? This is the village of the Sephira—a sacred land only accessible to our people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>What do you want with Lady Emmel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I have no reason to answer you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Then you leave me no choice... Huzzahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Hrnngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>As Lady Emmel's protector, I will show you no mercy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Arrghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>What is your purpose here? What do you want with Lady Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>How did you come to be here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Answer me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>With the power of darkness at my command, it was a simple matter to infiltrate your village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>The power of...darkness?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Hrrghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Nnrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>It's over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>What is your purpose here?! Why...? Why would you do something like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>The world must not be changed. I will put a stop to any who attempt to alter the way of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>There is only one reason for me to take up my blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>And that is, as I have said, to protect this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>You...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>That was quite a show, Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Heh. It was the least I could do for you. I felt like I owed you something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>This airship will traverse the Dark Barrier, and go on to be the medium that links all of the belt regions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Yeah...eventually. Not sure when that will happen, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>This is the new model, you know, but it was still a close thing. I barely survived the trip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>The old model never would have made it through that barrier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I'm gonna need to make some improvements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I suppose you'll be handling that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I'll need to revise the airship's blueprints. Otherwise, I won't be able to get the budget for making the Engineer Soldier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Well, over in the Acedia Belt Region, we need our airships.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>People get that, but...they don't feel the same way about my Engineer Soldier. It doesn't get the same level of support.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Why not? That Soldier of yours is immune to the corruption. It can fight without fear of becoming Fallen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>They know it can fight...but they don't want to resort to fighting. They're just waiting for the earthquakes to stop on their own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>The Engineer Soldier just isn't what they're looking for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Adaleigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>But since coming here, I've finally been able to prove that the Engineer Soldier is useful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>I'm gonna tell everyone back home all about it, and make them see that the soldier is worth having around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Sounds like you're in for a rough time, even after your voyage is done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Well... Yeah. It's gonna be that way for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>But not forever! Right, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Right. I have every faith that things will get better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>(If we can just eliminate sin...I can finally free Emmel.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>(I must lead this mad world into it's rightful form.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Hm...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>What's wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Show yourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Nnrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Be on your guard, Nimul! They are not to be taken lightly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>What is going on?!</td>
</tr>
