<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Th-thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No need to thank me. On reflection, as guardian of this forest, it was my responsibility to take care of that kerfuffle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That being said, I can't believe you would step into this ancient forest without the means to protect yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Perhaps you're not as big of a fool as I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Um, well, usually I would try a little harder, but...ouch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Are you hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ah, well, sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Why do you apologize? Follow me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I told you that it was my responsibility, didn't I? I'll at least look after your wound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Don't stare at everything so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So-sorry. There's just a lot of rare equipment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's the shaman's job to brew herbs. There's nothing special about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Here. Show me your wound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Um, okay...but it's just a scratch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wild beasts have poison in one shape or another. It can sometimes be fatal to those who are weak, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Honestly. All this commotion they're causing is nasty business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Are you talking about those monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Not only are they laying waste to this forest, but those fools are also becoming more aggressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Laying waste? To this forest? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Have you heard of a place called the Ancient Dragon Bones?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Those steep mountain ranges that run between Saga and Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Much lore and legends remain in Saga, but that land has an exceptionally exaggerated origin in comparison to the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It is said, in ancient times, that mountain was a savage dragon that strode the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>However, with its gigantic form, there was no way it could survive by any normal means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Thus, the son of men thought to themselves...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The heart of the dragon must be a lump of Alchemia comparable to that of a Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Is that really true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It's just a legend. However, there are those foolish enough to believe it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>And by those, I'm referring to Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Perhaps something had occurred to the Sacred Stone, or perhaps they were driven by obsession.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>In any case, they descended into thieves who lay waste to the forest of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But why the forest? This place is far from that mountain range.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The reason they come to this forest is to gain the ability to hear the spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The spirits are the Alchemy that nature wields. They are the phantoms summoned by the land itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Their belief was that if you could hear that voice,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>you could hear the voice of the dragon's heart as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>So Gluttony Foss is after advanced Alchemia sensing capabilities?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's a silly story. Legends are, after all, just legends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>They are quite the dreamers to hitch their wagon to such a non-existent star.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Well, your treatment has finished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Um. I still can't go home yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I understand. You want to discover a way to regain your power, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>D-do you know how?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Of course, I don't. Why would I be responsible for solving your problems?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But well...if you have the qualities of a shaman, there are things you will begin to see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Are you talking about...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Within the oral traditions of Saga, occasionally a story emerges about an exceptionally talented individual who can create beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>These beasts are projections of their past. Mysteries harbored within the memories of an individual whose unreachable nostalgia is seared into their bodies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Nostalgia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The Alchemia that this individual is said to possess mediates a memory's likeness and is projected onto this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The way of existence for a shaman of Saga is to walk with the forest, to serve the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That is why a shaman of Saga will sometimes 'call the forest.'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Doesn't this forest feel nostalgic to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Um...yes. For some reason, I feel calm here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>That feeling is most likely your source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Your defense against conflict from the outside world and your craving for a distant home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>These have been made obvious through your Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>These are my animals? But then why do they no longer appear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>People are creatures who easily forget.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Even the most passionate emotion, the most built up dream crumbles under the passing of days and is forgotten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>By doing so, it leads to everyday life. That must be the wisdom of people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>But I didn't feel at home at the court.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Still, if you have accepted that location as your place of living it lead to oblivion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Perhaps you had entertained the idea</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>that you were an individual from Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You must accept yourself without any beasts. Eventually, you will get used to it...to being alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That's impossible! I can't do that. I can't forget them! I have to see them again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What should I do?! How can I hear the voices of the animals again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What a strong...or should I say sweet emotion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What is forgotten can never return. However, if that bond remains within you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Live with the forest, child of Saga. If you can recall why you summoned the beasts, the spirits will respond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>This is assuming the so-called beasts that you summoned were true spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Live in the forest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>That being said, right now you are so weak that a single monster can wound you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Well, as a compromise you could live in the village near the forestâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Live here, bloodline of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What?! You show up all of a sudden and say something like that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It gratifies me to increase those who can hear my voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>B-but I can't allow an outsider to live here in this forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>You were the one who said he should live in a forest. Take responsibility for your words, shaman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Ack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Umm. In other words?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>One month! I will forgive your sojourn into this forest for just one month. After that, you're on your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Um. What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What are you hesitating for? It's preparation for dinner of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Bu, umm, is this fish? I've never touched one before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ah, so you're a vegetarian.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Not really. Um, in Lustburg there are a lot of stores, so I usually ate there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>That's not my concern! There's an old saying: when in Saga, do as those of Saga do. It's the way of the forest for one to prepare one's meal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>It's easy for you to say, but...eh...it's bleeding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>You fool. Don't hold a blade with your eyes closed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I-I finished...fetching water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Well done. Or so I'd like to say, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Why did it take until noon to finish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Be-because usually the animals always helped me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>How cozy of a life were you living until now</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Umf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Wait. What are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>What do you mean? I'm trying to start the fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Don't rely on magic for something like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>For starters, using that kind of Alchemia in a place with such a high concentration of Alchemia willâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Whoa! The flame is huge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Control the force of your art! And you call yourself a Court Mage or whatever?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I'm tired. Really tired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Never mind. I'll congratulate you on your effort. You familiarized yourself well with this forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>You have already been recognized as a shaman of this forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>How is it? Has that beast spoken to you again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>No, not yet. I call out to it, but it doesn't respond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Then the connection must already be severed. Spirits bonded only through human thoughts tend to usually be unstable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Very well. There's no turning back now. You can stay as long as you need to until you accomplish your goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>What? Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Don't question my answer! If I said it's fine, then it's fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Why did you suddenly go quiet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I was just thinking about how kind you are, Peridot. At first, I felt scared because the way you spoke was really stern, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Oh? Are you trying to pick a fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>N-no...um, that's not what I meant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I wanted to say thank you for looking after a stranger like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>It would've been horrible to throw you out in the state that you were in and have you die outside. I'd have to carry that on my conscience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Yes. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>We-well then, you still haven't fetched the water for today! Do you want to cause me more trouble?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Oh, right! I'll go now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Your snickering is getting annoying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Good encounters produce good results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>What good results? Ever since he came, my life has been turned upside down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>People are not the same as plants. Just like the shamans of the past, you are a child of man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>The shaman protects us spirits, but that is it. They cannot live together with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Live together? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>He does not have much longer. As a spirit, I am sure you are aware of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>On his back, I saw...the shadow of death. Most likely, some disaster will befall him soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Court Mage Flamel, huh? You're shouldering quite the difficult fate. Maybe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>He may be happier taking root in this forest that is disconnected from the outside world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>I know it sounds out of character.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>I said stop laughing like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>All right, this is the last one! I think I've gotten somewhat accustomed to this life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>I wonder why the animals don't respond to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>I don't need their strength. I don't need them to do anything. I just want them to be there for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Yikes. If I have a gloomy expression on my face, Peridot will scold me again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Hm? Is someone there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>That's not an animal from this forest. Right, that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Agh! My head...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>No! Nooo! I don't want to leave this forest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Give it up, Flamel. This place is no longer habitable for people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Can you hear it? Can you hear the forest scream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>This forest will no longer accept peopleâ€”accept those who are alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>But everyone I know is here! I'll be...all alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Awooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>A wolf? A wolf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>No, Flamel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>The animals of this forest have been polluted by the Alchemia coming from those ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>They will eventually transform into monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>No...that's terrible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>You cannot change what has already happened. That's why you must remember them...how gentle they were and how beautiful this forest was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>After all, you are the last shaman of this forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>That's right, I... Those animals... How could've I forgotten something so important?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Wolf? Is there something over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>We've completed our search. There are no traces of anyone living nearby.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>I see. We're deep into the forest, yet I still do not see anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Is this alleged shaman really here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Yes, Captain, according to the information we obtained from the neighboring village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Is there any possibility that this shaman who can hear spirits has become aware of our presence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>There hasn't been a sound since stepping into this forest. At the very least, I doubt our exact location is known.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Are they from Gluttony Foss? A shaman who can hear spirits. Are they talking about...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>That being said, it's a hassle to bring the shaman back alive. At least maybe we can cut off an arm or a legâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>They've noticed me! I can't go back to Peridot's place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>I will stop them here!</td>
</tr>
