<td>Watch your back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Woah, thanks for the save.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Don't mention it. Monsters around here are pretty aggressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hi there, my name's Blair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm Soren. It's nice to finally meet you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh? Have you heard of me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Roxanne constantly gushes about the craftsmanship on her guns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Good to hear she likes them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Let's head back to my workshop, my automata are digging the snow pits and I'll come back later once they're done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>*grumble* How are these guns so worn down?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Urgh, that Roxanne. I wish she would try gun maintenance at least once, repair materials aren't cheap for these.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You all must have been fighting a demon or something to get it to this state!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Heh, funny you would say that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>A-anyway, what's with the monster situation in the village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's been going on for a few days now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't think the monsters are the ones actually at fault for the stolen and broken tools though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What makes you say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, after examining some of the footprints I've noticed most of them are fox prints.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And among the monster sightings? Not a single villager mentioned anything about foxes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh, that's interesting. I don't suppose you can build an animal trap to lure and capture these foxes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's a great idea Soren! I'll build one now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Sounds good. I'll help wherever I can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Minutes pass, and with the trap built, Soren and Blair head out to the woods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Let's hope the noise from this toy trap will be enough to attract them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hopefully the foxes don't tear up the toy too much, I still have to return it to my kid neighbor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(That toy is most definitely gone. Poor kid...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh! There they are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wait, those aren't foxes! They're fox spirits!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The foxes are getting away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No time for that now Blair, the monsters are coming! Prepare to fight!</td>
</tr>
