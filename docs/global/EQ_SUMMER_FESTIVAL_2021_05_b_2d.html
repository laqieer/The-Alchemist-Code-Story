<td>Yes! They are! Oh, how can I thank you?</td>

<td>It was nothing really. I found the thieves and persuaded them to return the items.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>Thank you all so much. Now, we'll be in time for the lantern floating. The souls we mourn will be able to find their way.</td>

<td>What's a lantern floating? I did notice a lot of people at the festival carrying lanterns.</td>

<td>It's a Wadatsumi custom. The spirits of the dead are guided down the river by the lights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>Oh, so that's what they're for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>Mmhmm! The lanterns are said to light the path for them, so that they have landmarks to find their way back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>These lanterns are decorations welcoming souls returning from the other side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ainan.png" alt="Ainanna" height="128"><br>Ainanna</td>
<td>So you mean the spirits come all the way back here to be mourned?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>Yes. I'm sure the souls will come back for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>That way the living can meet the dead and each side can find closure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ainan.png" alt="Ainanna" height="128"><br>Ainanna</td>
<td>Well, that's rather convenient.</td>

<td>Don't you think that's a good thing? That's something the living want, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>...Yes, they do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>I'll send a lantern, too. There's someone I would like to offer my feelings to if they can make it back.</td>

<td>Oh, that's a fine idea.</td>

<td>Well, I suppose all that pointless time did have some meaning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ainan.png" alt="Ainanna" height="128"><br>Ainanna</td>
<td>Seems so. What a pain in the neck!</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>I think I'll go look for Ephylinde.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/thol.png" alt="Sol" height="128"><br>Sol</td>
<td>Well, then I too shall seek out someone to reflect on the past with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>Very well. Until next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>Take this lantern. They'll be floating them down the river over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>

<td>After the lanterns have traveled on, I'll need to speak to her properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>Tell her thank you... Tell her I'm sorry... Say all the things I haven't begun to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>There are so many things I have to say. And after I've said them, I wonder...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>...I wonder if I will be able to shake her hand again.</td>
