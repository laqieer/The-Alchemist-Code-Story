<td>Phew... I think that's all of them. Damn, I'm out of ammo...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Courage, watch out! I'm still picking up a signal for another exosuit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Forgot about me, huh?! Get ready to meet your maker!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're kidding! I thought we'd got them all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Crap, gotta reload!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Raaaaaaaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wha—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What the...?! Another suit?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Courage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oof... Damn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Now that was close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You two holdin' up okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We are, thanks to you. But why did you help us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We heard the caravan was being attacked, so we flew on over to do what we could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm glad you did. You probably just saved my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No sweat! It'd be a waste not to put these suits to good use, seein' as we've got 'em and all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, I appreciate it. I've gotten some great data out of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I reckon we can handle things from here. See you 'round!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hmm... So that's the crux of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Figured something out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Maybe so. I've realized that deciding who to trust with your creation is the most critical part of development, as well as the most challenging.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Deciding who to trust...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(That reminds me of the first time my dad ever let me hold a gun.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That thing in your hands could kill a man stone dead with a twitch of a finger. A gun is a powerful weapon, kid—and an even bigger responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You mustn't ever point a gun at a living creature unless it's for the right reasons, and you must be ready for the consequences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Con-se-que...? Daddy, you're using big words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Maybe you're a bit young for this, huh? Then just remember this: Only point your muzzle where your convictions tell you to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>My dad trusted me with this gun, as well as his faith that I'd use it well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>He taught me that a gun is just like any other tool. It can take a life just as easily as it can entertain a crowd at a sports contest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Guns are capable of anything, he said. That's why we have to be certain to use them for good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>He taught me by example to never point my gun at a living creature unless I'm certain it's the right thing to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So I know in my heart that he'd never betray those convictions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Based on the available evidence, I think your conclusion is sound. Unfortunately, the only way to get a complete picture is to meet your father in the flesh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I think I do want to see him after all. I need to know the truth of him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Finally made a decision, then? What a fruitful trip this has been.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yeah, I think I have. Thanks, Reagan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Not at all. You'll function more efficiently with a clear head, and you'll treat your weapon better, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Don't worry. My clubbing days are over, I promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Anyway, we should get back. The sooner I get packed, the sooner I can start looking for my dad.</td>
