<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I got you. We have to focus. The first ships of the enemy fleet will get to the city soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Most of the Purple Flame Knights are out here on the ocean! If we don't stop them now, we'll lose this battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm getting ready to deploy the Engineer Soldiers! But I don't have the room to make a sharp turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If those enemies reach the city, we won't be able to stop them anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I know that, but—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Grrraaaaaggghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The corruption is still building?! We're going to have to use our trump card now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Andechs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>—I hear you loud and clear! Be there in a snap, so just hold tight a lil' longer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sorry, princess. I'll have to borrow your sacred beastie for a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You're fighting to protect our kingdom, so there's no need to apologize. Look, Selsieg is raring to go too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Bwirruru!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Haha, perfect! Let's hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...I can...still...go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Daphne! Don't overdo it! If you keep going forward alone, then—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>N-no...! This shield and I must...somehow...at least protect...all of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Worthless—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You are not enough to face me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The will to despise the enemy, the resolve to battle for supremacy, the anger that burns straight through your soul... None of it is enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If this is all that a knight of Invidia is, then you do not have the right to call yourself my enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Just die. You are not fit to be a soldier anyway. It's your mistake for thinking you'd be anything but unsightly on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>D-Daphne!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I can't get a hit in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(Captain Imnus, Lady Nicaea, I'm so sorry.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(I.. I couldn't follow through in the end...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Now give in—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(I knew it... I wasn't good enough for this shield...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh? I'm...alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Aren't you giving up a bit too quickly there, little lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I told you before, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>"Let's leave the questions and incredulities for later, shall we? Keep your eye on what's happening right in front of you. We're trying to prevent a tragedy over here!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Stand up and brace yourself. This battle isn't over yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>As long as we still have the will to keep fighting, no battle is ever truly over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Andechs, you came!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Heh, sorry for the wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I appreciate that you wanted to prevent me from having to turn my blade against my own people. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>This is already my battlefield!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm burning with righteous wrath! I'm here for the weak, the just, the ones who wish to protect something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Affirming all these people is the path I have chosen to walk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Now that I'm here, I won't let you take anything away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Groooooaaaaaagghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>ANDEEEECHS!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Be careful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, well... A test of strength? Luckily, this just happens to be my specialty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>He pushed his sword back?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Mwuahaha! That's right! You would be able to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>This knight...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(His strength is one thing, but why is he so obsessed with me?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(He's acting like he knows who I am...but I don't remember doing anything that'd make anyone so passionate about killing me!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...We're not backing down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Everyone, pick yourselves back up! This is the moment of truth!</td>
