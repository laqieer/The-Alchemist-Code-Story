<td>Shake the entire world? What are you talking about, Vice-Captain Monzein?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The Sacred Stones that belong to the Seven Kingdoms contain the power to destroy this entire world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>After all, they're the reason why the Seven Kingdoms wield the most power over the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's why, right now, we should be following our original plan and heading to Gluttony in order to rendezvous with the 4th Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But I sense a sinister presence from the direction of the wind shrine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If the 4th Regiment had been in pursuit of that presence, it means they went the wrong way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Furthermore, there's a possibility that they will inflict harm on the people of Alize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I agree. I wonder if the enemy managed to successfully trick Captain Kudan and the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There's a possibility of that, but you can also think of it this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Those traces of battle and the coat of arms of the 4th Regiment may be a ruse that those being pursued by the Holy Guard have set up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Their intention is to deceive us and split us up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's absurd! You're reading too much into this. For starters, we're not certain that the 4th Regiment was even chasing this sinister presence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We should focus on preventing the possibility of a Sacred Stone being stolen instead of following some uncertain theory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That also falls into the realm of theories as well! Plus, the only proof you have is that coat of arms on the ground. It's not very convincing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Please, don't fight! Let's calm down and come up with a plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What do you think about asking the cavalry of Gluttony for support?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If there are enough men, we won't have to split up at all, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>They're often moving about these grasslands. I'll fly my hawk to see if it can find any of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Although that makes sense, in theory, the reality is a little more complicated. The Gluttony cavalry are not very cooperative towards the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh...?! What...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The reason is simple. I come from the bloodline of the Alize people's chief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What? The people's chief...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>B-but what does that have to do with this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Tsk. Here they come! Save the talk for after we defeat these monsters!</td>
