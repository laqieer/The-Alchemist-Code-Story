<td>That also falls into the realm of theories as well! Plus, the only proof you have is that coat of arms on the ground. It's not very convincing.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/monz.png" alt="Monzein" height="128"><br>Monzein</td>
<td>Although that makes sense, in theory, the reality is a little more complicated. The Gluttony cavalry are not very cooperative towards the Holy Guard.</td>
