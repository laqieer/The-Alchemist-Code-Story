<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>An...octopus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yeah! Apparently, there's a giant octopus living in some ruins in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I also heard that the ruins are full of treasure! That's what I was talking about, not that Demon or whatever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>This ancient site is where the archaic doctrine summoned and later sealed a Demon. That much I'm certain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is the first time I am hearing about an octopus, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What are you doing here, Kaya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I heard about the giant monster attacking beachgoers and immediately recalled the legend pertaining to these forgotten ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Naturally, that was all the more reason for me to come here and see what I could do about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I am well-versed in the lore of this site, so I was confident that I could deal with whatever I might encounter here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Not to mention that I personally find these ruins fascinating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>All right! Sounds to me like we came here with the same idea, Kaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hm? What exactly do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, you were thinking of taking down that monster yourself, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Not exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The only reason I was confident in acting alone was because I knew that I could entrust the beach patrol to my two colleagues in my absence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Do you possess a different perspective?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm the captain! I've gotta be the one to protect my crew!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Especially Su Yi... She has a real hard time expressing herself, you know? Leave her alone for too long and all those suppressed words end up building up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's why I thought I'd go on ahead and take care of things. I have to make sure they're safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Interesting. You are most kind. I wonder, though, if your course of action was entirely necessary...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh? What're you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If you will allow me a metaphor... A child who falls and scrapes their knee will not cry if there is an adult present to help them to their feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>However, should they have no hand to grasp, they will likely begin to form some measure of independence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, my apologies. That was rather forward of me. I really shouldn't have said anything, given how little I know of your situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I am not really qualified to be giving advice on such matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No, no! What you said made total sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm just...scared. She's a real fighter, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>She ends up overthinking and pushing herself too far. I don't want something like that to happen again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Su Yi! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>She has a fever... She has pushed herself too far. Her illness may be cured, but her stamina is still quite low.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We have no choice but to stop over at the next port.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No... We're so close... After all that research...finding the best possible route...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>So what?! None of that matters now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm s-so sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>This isn't the end, okay? Don't worry. We can set sail again. In fact, our voyage has only just begun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We're just taking a little break. Okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What've you got there, Su Yi? Are these maps? Nautical charts? There are so many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>These show the area around this island, right? Why do you have so many?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>U-um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I-I'm collecting them. I like looking at maps and nautical charts. Seeing how they, um, change over time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>When I found out that we were coming here, I...sort of thought I should do some research beforehand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Really? That's so cool! You're a real navigator!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>N-no! It's not cool at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huh? What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I-I'm...sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's fine. It's nothing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It doesn't look like nothing to me! You can't fool me. I was an instructor once, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I-instructor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I mean, okay, I wasn't all that good at it. But Sharon did say she was glad that I was the one who trained her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hearing that, I decided to be more confident in myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You should be more confident in yourself, Su Yi! You're the navigator for the Xiao Shenmeiâ€”that's pretty darn amazing if you ask me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It...really isn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>(Shenmei doesn't see me as a real crew member. She still thinks I'm just a kid.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(That's why I want to do this alone.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Shenmei?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hey! What's this X mark on the map for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>U-um, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I heard that there were ancient ruins in this area and found out what I could about them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>By comparing various sources of information, I pinpointed this spot as their possible location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Ruins? I haven't heard anything about any ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>The ruins of an ancient cult... They're currently occupied by a giant octopus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I didn't find anything resembling an entrance in that area, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What are the two of you doing out here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Sharon! How'd it go? Did you find any clues?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Not a single one. Perhaps they've wandered into the octopuses' lair?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Hey, Su Yi? Think you could show us whereabouts you got separated from Shenmei?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>H-huh? Umm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>It was around...here. B-Bertha...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I knew it. X marks the spot... In I go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>W-wait! What are you doing, Bertha?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Look! You can get in through this gap in the rock!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Huh? R-really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It's pretty hard to notice...but I'm sure Shenmei must have got in through here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Difficult to notice indeed... How did you find this little opening, Bertha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hee hee hee... I'm not a gunner of the Envylia Royal Knighthood Artillery Regiment for nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>It takes a sharp pair of eyes to be able to scan the battlefield and fire on the optimal spot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>True enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I'm not sure why she would have gone in alone, but...maybe she saw the hole and thought it seemed like a fun place to explore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Bertha... Don't you think you ought to be a bit more respectful? That's her captain you're talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I didn't mean anything by it! I'm sure she had her reasons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I bet she went on ahead...to keep me from worrying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>But now you're worried, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Then you've gotta tell them! Tell those two worrywarts how you feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I suppose I am one of those worrywarts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Liu Shen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I understand. Thank you for filling me in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>If these are the only ruins in this area, then it stands to reason that Xiao-Xiao must have wandered in here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Knowing Xiao-Xiao, she must have caught sight of something suspicious and thoughtlessly followed them here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Our captain has a tendency to attempt to take on everything by herself, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Shenmei...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>However, this location is also known to be the lair of some ferocious octopuses. Su Yi, you wait here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I'm going to go and look for Shenmei with you! I-I'm worried as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Besides...I'm the one who found this entrance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>I'm a pirate too! I can take on a horde of ferocious octopuses any day of the week!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Cause I'm... I'm the navigator for the Xiao Shenmei!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>U-um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Take us through the shortest possible route. It doesn't matter how dangerous it is. I will take care of anything that stands in our path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>We need to find Xiao-Xiao before nightfall. Searching for her in the dark would be much more difficult and dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>U-um... R-really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>What? You are a superb navigator, Xiao-Xiao. I trust you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Okay! Leave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Whoo! So proud of you, Su Yi! Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Is this really all right? You were so worried about her...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I still am. So worried I feel like my heart might give out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Please don't die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>However...I realize now that our worries have been burdening her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>She does seem quite happy to be leading us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>She does... You know, I never thought I'd see the day that Xiao-Xiao would speak her mind to me without hesitation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>It just goes to show that there is still room for growth, even after becoming a Phantom Soldier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Whoa! Look at them all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>You know what? I'm feeling rather generous. I'm only going to marinade you for thirty seconds before I put you on the grill!</td>
</tr>
