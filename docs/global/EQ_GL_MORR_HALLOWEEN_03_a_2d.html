<td>Ah, to burn with the zeal of youth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Few souls shone as bright as Soren; he was practically glowing when I first saw him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>All humans carry imperfections within them. He was no different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yet what drew me to him was his earnest desire for a world free of conflictâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Not directly by his own hand, but by his creations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes. The Constructs, he called them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I cared little for the details, only what he sought to achieve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Rare is the soul that acknowledges Man's natural thirst for blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's how it is. We humans must seem so petty to you, squabbling over such minutiae.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Heh...and that's intriguing? I suppose that's how I would feel if I were an elf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>My time will come soon. It is almost ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The pride of my life - my magnum opus - will change the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We parted ways shortly after, and I left that land for a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Perhaps part of me expected to see the fruits of his labor - a world filled with those unthinking, unfeeling machines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But when no news reached me, my curiosity was piqued.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I suppose that was why I found myself in Lustberg once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tell me what will become of him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Little has changed here, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That pulse troubles me greatly. Reveal yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...Your aura. A mix of the child and Soren's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Lachesis. The second of Master's greatest creations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We who are called the Sisters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The vision speaks with uncommon clarity. Be thou hostile of intent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I could hear you, so I answered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...Even from a ritual? You are stranger than I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If you know of Master...surely, you can help him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Please, Miss...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You may call me Morrigan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Miss Morrigan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It is not my place to intervene in an individual's journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Moreover, your master never received of my blessing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>But...you helped Eira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Is an elf not allowed to protect innocent creatures?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, this world is full of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Would you let the world go to ruin, knowing what they want from my Master?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Projekt Goetia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Lachesis looks hesitant for a brief moment as the vision begins to warp into a possible future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Atop a bloodied mound, the Director and two Goetia members survey the carnage in the war-torn fields below.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>As you can see, Director, everything is proceeding apace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It won't be long before they fall groveling at our feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The second battalion has reported overall success on the western front as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>They are en route to our position for additional reinforcements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>An era of death and ruin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What could they possibly want to achieve with thousands of dead souls?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Move the injured, quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>We can't hope to push them back, but we can evacuate as many people as we can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ngh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I won't let my past self...end up a bringer of ruin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>So must we all play our part.</td>
