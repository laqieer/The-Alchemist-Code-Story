<td>Damn... It got away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That monster didn't seem quite right to me. What is going on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's Rosa's concoction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Mei Fang!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The moment you left, that little imp began testing her concoction on that monster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I was intending to deal with her the moment I caught her in the act, but the monster went on a rampage and I lost sight of her in the confusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It is as you feared. She has not given up on her tincture after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Unbelievable! With me, both of you. I will not allow such misdeeds to go unpunished, not by any means!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This is it! This is just what I wanted. Thank you, Elizabeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, the effects were a little bit more extreme than I'd expected, but that's exactly why I used a monster for my first test.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Now that I know its effects better, I'm gonna use my special tincture to dye this year's Halloween red and black! Heehee... This is gonna be so much fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Not if I have anything to say about it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, my. Look what the cat dragged in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Rosa... There will be consequences for your actions this day. You have imperiled Halloween and dashed the expectant spirits of all the children who look forward to it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Upon my word, I will ensure that the standards of this occasion are upheld!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Really? Who jeopardized Halloween for the children first, I wonder?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Come again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If anything, I'm the guardian angel of all children. In fact, I believe I am the savior of this entire world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yeah! Yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wh-what is the meaning of this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Heehee... The time is nigh. Now we will let loose all we have been forced to suppress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This is a holy war and you are the warriors who will fight it, O Sweet Children of Rot und Schwarz. You shall stain this dark night blood red!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So come! Come together, my little ones. We will take back our Halloween...and paint it red and black!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Trick or treat! Give us our candy or you'll get pranked! Let us stay up late or we'll give your hair a yank!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh ho. They're quite spirited, aren't they? Their words amount to nothing more than a pitiful tantrum, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Still, they might have something of a point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What are you saying?! She's turned the children into delinquents! This is bad, but there is still time to make it right. The buds of misconduct must be plucked before they have a chance to bloom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes. Staying up late flies right in the face of the standards for this occasion. As their elder, I must steer these children back onto the proper course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You want us to listen to you, but you won't listen to us! Well, if you won't hear us out, then take this! Come out, my little fiendish friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Numyua!</td>
