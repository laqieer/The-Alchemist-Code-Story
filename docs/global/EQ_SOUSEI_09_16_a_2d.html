<td>You're not supposed to be moving! All that Space-Time Manipulation's got your insides all discombobulated!</td>

<td>I had to speed you up wholesale to match that other shield lady, and it kinda pushed you to your breaking point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What?! You mean, you manipulated time for my entire being? Isn't that dangerous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yeah, it is! That's why I'm telling you to stop moving!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We've secured a path to retreat. Grab my shoulder and hold on tight, okay?</td>

<td>008</td>
<td>What? No, I should...!</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Holy crud! You're heavy!</td>

<td>That's the shield. And my armor, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, I'll manage. I'm use some more Space-Time Manipulation, if I have tâ€”</td>

<td>Whoa! What was that? It sounds like it came from where Nyx and Eulalia were fighting!</td>

<td>He reported in earlier to say that they'd won the battle, so I thought they were in the clear. C'mon, Nyx! You'd better be okay!</td>

<td>She looks like she should've dropped dead a thousand times already, but somehow, she's still going at it!</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That voice! Has Mesarthim been defeated?!</td>

<td>(She can hear me over the link with Mira?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It appears she, too, can hear the voices of spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Why do you think I answered your call to battle? Why do you think I'm here now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This is a battle for the fate of the world. I've no choice but to defeat you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Now, shall we continue?</td>
