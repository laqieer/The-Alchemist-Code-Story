<td>001</td>
<td>(When did it start? This ever-present ache in my left eye...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(I escaped that cursed home. I sank deeper into the darkness. I hunted for the meaning of the shadows.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(For the meaning of the never-ending death. Massacre. Blood spilled. I hated it. I escaped...didn't I?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are you listening, assassin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Nn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It is disrespectful to simply continue drinking while I speak to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey. There is no reason to raise your voice. I can hear you just fine. It's just that "assassin" is not actually my name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Your name doesn't matter to me! I just need to know if you understand what I am asking you to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What's to understand? You want me to kill that...what did you call him? "Ungrateful little git"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Exactly! That boy seems to have forgotten that he could never have joined the Holy Guard without me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Me! He owes me everything! Yet I'm stuck in this pointless, backwater place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Gr... I will return to Northern Pride... No matter what it costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What exactly are you laughing at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No, no. It's just the shadows. They're whispering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What? You're an odd one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(Ugliness exists everywhere, even...or especially...in clerics...and those clad in rich, splendid clothing.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well. Thanks for the job. I'll go do it now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hey. Can you really do what I ask? That man is quite strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Of course. No one, no matter how heroic, powerful or beloved... No one is safe from an assassin like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Even the mighty "Silver Steed" whose majesty on the battlefield is well-known... Even if he is on the short-list to become the next Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>He is dead, he just does not know it yet. I swear that by the darkness within me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(I was born in the shadows. I ran from them, but they followed me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Zahar of the Holy Guard will die by my hand. I, Corvus Leonhart, swear upon the house I was born to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Now, if you will excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hello. I am Corvus. I will be joining the Holy Guard's 4th Regiment from today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hm... I heard that you passed the trial with flying colors. I would like to hear in your own words... Why are you here? What do you hope to accomplish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Uh... Yessir. I hope to dedicate my life to protecting the Holy Order and the peace of the people of Babel, Vice-Captain Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hm. Well. I look forward to seeing what you will do with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...Yessir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(The shadows in me whispered and recoiled. They knew I was no match for him.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(Those eyes held an abyss of unending darkness... They dragged me in. Or did I fall?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(After all that effort getting into the Holy Guard! After getting so close!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Nnnghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(My left eye, my evil eye...cried out in fear! I had never met an opponent such as this before!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(Still...I had made my vow.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(And so I stayed with the 4th Regiment as I tried to figure out how to kill Zahar.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(However, he never showed weakness. Not even once. All I could do was keep pretending and watching.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(It was beyond infuriating. I could not accept that he might be an opponent I could not best.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(The days blurred together as I continued to play my role and waited for my chance.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(Then, that day...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Corvus. Prepare what you need for a mission to Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wratharis? What kind of mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We must make an example of a noble who has broken the Magna Code by using and conducting alchemical experiments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Alchemy...? A bold choice. How many should I expect to face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>One.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>One...? So, we're just going to arrest the noble?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No. Our orders are to...dispose of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Kill them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Those are our orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well, it may be just one noble, but they will be escorted by Wratharis knights. Do not underestimate them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>U-understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(The mission called for a small cadre of knights led by Zahar and I to go to Wratharis. I was...uneasy.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(I had not imagined that the Holy Guard, tasked with maintaining peace, would order us to kill someone.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(Even if they had broken the Magna Code. Still... I could not pass up this opportunity.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Guhyah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(I had never seen such skill with a sword. I couldn't even see it as he cut down knight after knight.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(This was the Silver Steed of the Holy Guard, the most powerful of all the Paladins.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Corvus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Aghhh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Yessir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Well done, Corvus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Thank...you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Let us return. The mission is over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>(I completed the mission as a Paladin. Yet...the shadows in my heart whispered.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>(They rustled and shuddered. They insisted... "You cannot win against him.")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Why are you giving me money?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>This is the money you gave me to complete the job. I'm returning it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You...?! What are you saying?! Don't tell me you're chickening out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Yeah... That is exactly what I am saying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>How dare you?! Did you not vow on your house that you would kill him? Kill Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Kill me? This conversation is certainly interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You?! Assassin! You double-crossed me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>No! I would never... Vice-Captain, what are youâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Ah, Corvus, so naive... I knew what you intended the moment I laid eyes on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>And you, cleric. I am indeed grateful for your recommendation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>But it is a little much to ask me to turn a blind eye to the fact that you simply wanted to use me, let alone the fact that you tried to have me killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Eep?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Luckily for you, I am feeling generous. Leave now, and I will overlook what I have heard...this once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Grk... I will not forget this disgraceful treatment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Now, as for you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Vice-Captain... I suppose I am now to be disposed of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Corvus Leonhart, from Slothstein. Your family has made quite the name for themselves as assassins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I...am impressed that you know this much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Are you? It is only natural that I do a bit of research into an untrustworthy subordinate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>You knew who I was this whole time, so why...? Ah. I understand now. To draw out the cleric.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Jumping to conclusions, Corvus? That is a rather unbecoming habit of yours. No. I want you to serve me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Say again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>You have proven your abilities to me. I have been looking for someone like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>What is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I need you, because I have come to the conclusion that you are exactly who I need. Join me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Wait. Why me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Corruption is rife within the Holy Order. You have seen so for yourself, have you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Do you remember that noble in Wratharis? They had, in fact, broken the Magna Code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>But think about it. Who created the Magna Code? Who enforces it? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>The Holy Order uses it to create a monopoly on alchemy, so that they may continue to exploit the whole of Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>No, that's... That's ridiculous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Tell me, Corvus... Why do you think this continent can never escape war?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>The Holy Order and the Holy Guard supposedly protect the peace of Babel, and yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>When has Babel ever seen true peace? What have they been doing all this time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Vice-Captain Zahar... What do you mean to do about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I will change this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I will bring a new order to this tumultuous world and lead it to its true potential!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I will crush the duplicitous Holy Order and save the world from its lies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Are you nuts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>What, Corvus? You don't believe I can do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Come with me, Corvus! I will show you what we can do, together! Together, we have the strength to create a new order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>You, who could not escape the shadows, yet sought to do so! You can become the bridge between me and the world I hope to create!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Zahar...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>(His eyes...! Even disguised in the light, there was no mistaking the depths of darkness in his soul!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>The shadows within me... They whisper. They call for you, my lord... Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>(I would follow him. For one whose blood carries the curse of my house... He was the only hope one such as I had ever held.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>A single existence with the potential to tip the scales of power for the Holy Order...and for all of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Perhaps the "King of Darkness" of elven lore is nothing more than a pretty story. Or perhaps...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>To Wratharis again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Isn't this strange, though? To go all of a sudden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>The shadows whisper to me... They speak of danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Indeed, there will be danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>The time has come already... Well, I always knew it would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>(The throbbing of my left eye... It indicates something wrong with this mission.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Hold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Wha...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>You all... You are not my 4th Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Wait, what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Hello, Inquisitors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Inquisitors?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Dogs of the Holy Order whose only mission is to ensure the Holy Order's monopoly on alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>As expected of the Silver Steed. I am quite impressed that you caught us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Hmph. I suppose I can guess why you are here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>We can no longer allow you to live. You and your ideas are too dangerous. This here will be your final resting place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Ha! As if my will could be ended so easily! Do not underestimate me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Corvus, prepare yourself for battle! This is the moment our new world order begins to take shape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
