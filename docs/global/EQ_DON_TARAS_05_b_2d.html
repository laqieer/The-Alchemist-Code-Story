<td>Never.</td>

<td>No.</td>

<td>What the hell are you sayin'?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That is not good enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm...not good enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I can't do anything alone.</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Alone like this, I'm...nothing but a little girl!</td>

<td>Cut it out already!</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's...nnnngghh...p-painfully obvious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I can't stand being nothing but a tragic heroine. I can't bear to even look at my pathetic self.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It is so difficult to stand alone...but I didn't even understand that until recently!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I was so focused on becoming a praiseworthy mayor that I forgot something incredibly important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>There is one crucial requirement for being a mayor. Do you know what that is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's power, ain't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's simple, really. To be a mayor, you have to have people... Citizens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Without people to support you, you cannot be a leader!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Are you proud of that?!</td>

<td>In front of who?! There's nobody here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Then I will face a pitiful loss, and it will be my duty to turn this city over to you! That is what you told me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If that's how it must be...then unless I lose pitifully, I can't lose!</td>

<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Squeak... Squeak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Are you cryin'?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Squeak! Squeeeeeak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What are you lookin' at? The one who did in your master was me, ya got it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Squeak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You've been starin' at the sky this whole time. What're you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wait, are you projectin' our fight into the sky?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>All those times I attacked her, you were—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>A-Al—...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Heheh. You know, this reminds me of that time when Edgar and the others led us to the Sacred Stone. You're really trying your best, just like you did that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Are you...? Are you going to guide me, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Squeak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Aye, 'cause I like it best when Fiona is smiling and surrounded by flowers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>This...is...our...city!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You're so stubborn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>This is important to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Where's this resolve comin' from all of a sudden?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Our city is like steel! If you hit it, it may dent, but no matter how many times you dent it, it won't break!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The more you temper it, the stronger and more resilient it becomes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I am the mayor of this city of steel, and I will never give up! I will fight for you all, until my last breath!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Is she serious?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>People of Redington! If you can hear me—if you are watching this—then open your doors! Lend me your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I, Fiona Elester, the current mayor of this city, am begging you for your help! I want to move forward alongside you all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Do you take me to be your mayor, in sickness and in health, until death do us part?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I am prepared to be married to this city for the rest of my life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Come, walk hand in hand with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>What was with that crazy speech? No one's gonna come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>T-Taras! G-give me back my protection money!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Eep! W-we can't just s-stand back when our mayor is trying so hard for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I'm so ashamed of myself, I could cry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Y-you agree, don't you, guys?! Right, everyone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Th-that's right! This is our city!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>She said she's ready to be married to this city! We gotta do something, too! Take up your weapons, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Huzzaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Th-thank you, all of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Y-young lady, were you...? Is this what you were anticipating?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Not anticipating, per se...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Per se?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I had hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Tch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It's neither money nor power that motivates people. It's the law of humanity! I believe those were your words on moral obligation, Mr. Taras.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>We will no longer take this sitting down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Wh-what is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>It's over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Pardon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I lost. I won't be gettin' any protection money anymore. I'm outta business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You even wiped the floor with that outta control Alkaroid. I got nothin' left to protect these schmucks from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>You said you'd marry the city, didn't ya? Well, like I said, I'm not the type to interfere in people's love lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Mr. Taras...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>We'll back off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Please...wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>What do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Everyone, please listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I cannot in any way condone what the mafia—including their leader, Don Taras—has done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>However, they took on the unpleasant role of playing the villain in order to unite this city against a common enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>If they had defeated me, that would have been that. If I had won, they would have simply carried on the burden of their charade in preparation for future threats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>This city—no, this country—was on the verge of collapse, and I believe, with all my heart, that this ordeal has set us on a better path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I have confirmed that the damage caused by the Alkaroid attack was minimal, and that the losses suffered by the people of this city were limited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I cannot say that I forgive them for what they have done. However, I would like you to allow them to remain here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>N-no way! We can't just let them keep running around like they own the place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>They should be banished!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>If they had not been here, I could not have defeated the Alkaroid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>This country is still plagued by unrest. We do not know when the next attack will come and destroy our hard-fought peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>They are a necessary evil with which we must coexist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>B-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Of course, as mayor, I will be keeping a close eye on them. Or would you rather they be exiled?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>If they were to be released out into the world, you wouldn't be able to come and go freely anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Oh! Th-that's a good point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Well, I mean, if the mayor is sure, who are we to argue?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Mayor Edward, she really is your daughter, isn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>She's got me beat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Mr. Taras?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Huff...huff...huff... Mr. Taras! Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>The bad guys lost, remember? We're leaving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>You're really important to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Do you have a concussion or somethin'?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>You gave me confidence and resolve as a mayor. Although I must admit that it did hurt a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Didn't look like just a bit, from where I was standin'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>All right, then... Fine. It hurt. A lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Well, looks like everything's okay here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I don't mind. My body will heal. However, for someone who cares so much about this city to be treated as a bad guy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Your heart hurts worse than takin' a beatin', huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>That's all you need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>This city has a boss with a big heart. I know that much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Heh... Sorry. I didn't even bring a bouquet to your wedding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>That's not true. I have some flowers from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>My flower crown, see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>White roses. I borrowed them from father's grave. In the language of flowers, a white rose means both reverence, and keeping promises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>As mayor, and as my father's daughter, I will fulfill the promises I have made, just as you have done yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>I almost forgot to tell ya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>That dress looks good on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>This right arm of mine might be empty again, but I wanna try savin' this small world if I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Time continues on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>As the restoration continues, the citizens' lives slowly regain a bit of normality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>The clock tower in the center of the city has been restored to its former glory, and its beautiful chiming can be heard once again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>The beautiful, indomitable Fiona that was projected into the sky that day inspired something unexpected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>There's an unprecedented wedding boom going on in Slothstein right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Bzzzzt. Correlation does not compute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Okay, just gotta fix the camera connection, and... Ah, here we go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Let me try this again. Good morning, Ejitan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Good morning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>At any rate, it seems that the relationship between humans and robots may be nearing those peaceful, prosperous days of remarried life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>It's just like Miss Elester said. If Alkaroids keep evolving, they may become the cornerstone of humanity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Bzzzt. Understood. Order received. I will go now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>That's your specialty, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>I am the civil engineering Alkaroid, Ejitan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>My kind must support the humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Don't just sit there. Get goin' already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>S-sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Bzzzt. Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>The flowers are growin'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>The clouds are clearing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>The bell is tolling, the wind is blowing, and the flower petals are dancing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Driven by the wind, and moral obligation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>I... We are moving forward together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>There are times when there's a fierce headwind, and there are winters where all of the flowers wilt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Yet I'm surrounded by flowers again, and everyone is here to support me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>I can't help but smile.</td>
