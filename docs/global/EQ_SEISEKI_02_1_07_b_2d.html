<td>Hey, Kagura, what did you want to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ohh, that's right! I finally found him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Thank you for helping me. My name is Mizuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I see! So you're the boy who ran away with Chihaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes. I helped Chihaya escape from that menacing Alchemist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So what about Chihaya? Where is she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>She was with me until a while ago, but our pursuer found us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You two got separated?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I hid her at a specific place while I drew the pursuer away, but when I returned she wasn't there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh dear! We need to find her quickly before they do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>How about we go back to where you hid Chihaya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I was thinking the same thing! It's over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmm. So those are the famous Paladins that I've heard so much about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>They seem rather trivial, but I can't afford to brush them aside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Besides, I hadn't expected that girl to be alive. Heheh...hahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>How amusing! The more that stands between me and my domination, the more I feel it's worth it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That said, after I find that shrine maiden, I'll carefully observe just how much strength they have.</td>
