<td>That's the Gilrack Ruins. We'll have to walk right into the awaiting enemy. Keep your guard up.</td>

<td>U-um, wait! I feel it's too dangerous to charge in from the front, without knowing the enemy's strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Maybe we could divide the enemy.</td>

<td>What do you mean?</td>

<td>005</td>
<td>Our main force can draw as much of the enemy as they can to the front. Meanwhile, a separate battalion can go in from behind. That way we can attack from both ends.</td>

<td>At the very least, we should be able to confuse the rebels.</td>

<td>If we're to make our way around the enemy unnoticed, we'd need the separate battalion to be a small one. It would be dangerous.</td>

<td>I'll go. I should be able to make up for the lack in numbers, right?</td>

<td>Father, I'll go! I doubt anyone will be as effective as us two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hah. Very well. The two of you will lead the separate battalion and make your way around from the back. Make sure the power does not consume you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
