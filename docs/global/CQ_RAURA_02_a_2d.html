<td>HaaaAAA!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ha, now there's the feeling I've been missing. It's been some time since my last battle, but I'm still not one to fall to enemies such as those.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That said, there are quite a number of them. That girl said they always show up around this time. Does that mean she does this often?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Can she really fight off so many alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hiyaaaa! Get wrecked, bugs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What incredible magic! Such power, such beauty! The insects are fleeing in terror!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tch, I hate bugs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That magic just now... Was that you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yep. They always come in big groups like that, so I use it to drive them away. Who would have thought raising flowers could be so dangerous, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's incredible. You could do anything with that much magical power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>People say that a lot, but really just as long as I can keep these flowers safe, that's good enough for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You mean to say...all you use that magic for is protecting these flowers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah, so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But think of everything you could accomplish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm sure if you went to the School of Magic, for example, you could do even more incredible things. Have you really never thought of doing something like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...You sound just like my sis, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Your sister...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ah... Please accept my apologies. I didn't mean to cause you any distress. I was simply curious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...Actually, my sis and my father are both Court Mages. It's because of that that I almost never get to see her anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>And when I do, she always says stuff like that and tries to get me to come to the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's understandable, given your clear talent, but...I gather you don't appreciate that, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No! Because, if I go to the city, then who's gonna protect these flowers!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...I see. Not living up to expectations, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Laila, no! You can't leave the colosseum! Seeing you fight is all that keeps me going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If you leave, there'll be no fights worth watching anymore! Please don't go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(I can certainly relate. It's hard to say why, but it seems that this girl has been shining far longer and far brighter than I have.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(It's like she has something that I'm missing...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The...flowers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Did you say something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>These flowers, they're truly incredible. So fragrant and beautiful. I've never seen any quite like them. What are they called?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>O-oh, these are Sol Terrae! Their name means "sun upon the earth."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Their blooms certainly do rival the majesty of the sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I know, right? They're super rare!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But all kinds of bugs and monsters eat them because they smell so good. Plus, people keep picking them because they're so pretty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But guess what! I finally found some seeds a while back and have been taking good care of them here ever since!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Is that so? Well I can certainly see how much love you put into them from the flower bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Eheheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But they really do attract a lot of bugs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hey brat, I'm gonna get those damn flowers this time for sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You again! Don't you ever learn!? Or do I need to teach you again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Heh, these flowers are worth a fortune, and I'm not one to leave money on the table! But this time, I've brought along a few friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Whoa, he isn't kidding...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ganging up on a little girl, are you? How unsightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh? And who the hell're you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Just a traveler with more strength and beauty than she knows what to do with. And I'm going to make sure you don't lay one filthy finger on these beautiful blossoms!</td>
