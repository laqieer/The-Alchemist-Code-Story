<td>We took down the enemy, but that black mist...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's spreading more and more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hurry. Get away from here! If you're swallowed by that, you won't be able to escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Rena? Did you remember something?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes...just a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But let's talk later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's just around the corner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Everyone! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Phew... Somehow, we managed to escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What was that...black mist?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It is the thing that eats everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Eats everything? What do you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Memories, existences, worlds...everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Memories...existences... Uh... I'm not sure what you mean, but basically something's happening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That is a culmination of the thoughts someone is producing... It has now reached the point that they threaten to consume the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>At this rate, the people throughout this world will lose their memories, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ultimately, this world itself will be consumed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Be consumed...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Rena! Who is this someone you're talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm sorry. That's the full extent of what I can remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If we can find this someone and defeat them...then maybe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If we defeat that someone, can we return to our original worlds?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Maybe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Um... I'm sorry to ruin the excitement, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Could you explain it in a way that someone who joined half-way like me can understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh, right. I'll explain from the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I see. So, because of that, various worlds are trying to connect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's why Tyrfing, Sakura, and I came to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>According to Rena, that seems to be the case. And, in order to avoid a crisis in this world and to return to our own worlds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We need to regain Rena's memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Shekinah, would you like to come with us? More is better...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh! That might be a good idea! Besides, that strange black thing might show up again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I want to find a way to regain Rena's lost memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>There may be others besides us who have come to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Let's split up and search.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>All right. Well, Shekinah, stay safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You too, Tyrfing. Let's both make it back to Ragna safely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>She's gone. That was quite a showy outfit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Sakura, it's you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yomi! You're in this world too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>This world...? I don't really understand what's going on, but somehow I found myself here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What is this place? It doesn't look like this is the ninja village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, um...it's a long story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Um... Is that person a Phantom?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>A Phantom...? What's that? This thing is a Samurai.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>A Samurai?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Sakura...it's rude to call someone a "thing." That kinda talk is gonna get you killed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I've read about them before in an old document in Wadatsumi. They are ancient warriors similar to Phantoms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wow. I'm surprised they're mentioned in the writings of other worlds. Samurai are famous! Aren't they, Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Sakura...something is coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>More monsters? Such bad timing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Did they appear here as well?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>From the inside again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What should we do? Maybe we should temporarily withdraw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Growwwwl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>No good! We're surrounded!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Let's continue to defeat the monsters as we push forward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Here they come!</td>
