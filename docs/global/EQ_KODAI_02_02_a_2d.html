<td>001</td>
<td>...What's all this commotion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It seems that Lady Schmeier has escaped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We are mobilizing all soldiers in the castle as we speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>One of the seven Draconic Pillars... Even within the Dragon Realm, she remains a thorn in my side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I suppose it comes to me to--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't. If you take action, it will hinder the upkeep of the Dragon Realm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Leave this to me, if you would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ignacio...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That is indeed the name I was entrusted with. Though I do wish you would call me Yishai when it's the two of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You won't?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Very well, Yishai. I shall leave Schmeier to you then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Thank you, Ophioneus... Shahel, come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes, Lord Ignacio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...Schmeier, why do you refuse to understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The shell of this world is too small for humans to survive. Attempting to coexist will only lead to our shared extinction...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>For a dragon's castle, this place sure has a lot of humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's because Ophioneus was the first dragon to realize the utility of humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>They lack the strength and vitality of dragons, so they're forced to make up for it with ingenuity and creativity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>He decided that's the way things ought to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>He didn't see the forest for the trees, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What? How do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Nothing, just a bit of optimism. Come on; we're almost there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>H-hey, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Look! Right here, there's a hidden passage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Come on, we don't have time for--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No, I mean, these things are usually connected to the outside, right? This could be a shortcut out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Or it could be some sort of maze to throw off intruders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I already know a way out. Let's not risk it just to save a little time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It'll be fine, come on! Look, there's some sort of room up ahead...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hey, come back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This is--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Schmeier, you realize we're still being chased, right? What are you thinking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>There's some sort of strange Magil reaction going on. What is this stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Did someone hide it here? Or is this just where it goes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This is different from my Magil. Just what is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Schmeier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...Right, sorry. I'll figure it out later. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Alright, we finally made it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Now if we can just get out of this district--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but this road is closed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ugh, this is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Lady Schmeier, I beg you to please return. Leaving now would be ever so inconvenient for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...Yishai Ignacio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm surprised the renowned successor of Ophioneus would come all this way in person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hahaha, please, you flatter me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But this is as far as you ladies go. The seven dragons of salvation are quite important to us, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Now, let us head back to the castle, shall we? Before my trigger finger gets itchy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...Schmeier</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>How strong is this guy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'd say pretty strong. Well, he's got strength in numbers at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>And just who are you, exactly? I haven't seen your face around here before. What are you doing helping this woman?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What am I doing? Ha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'm just having some fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What an amusing little girl.</td>
</tr>
