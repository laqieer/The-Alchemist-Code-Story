<td>She's done it again, hasn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Kaya... has left the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I knew it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I hereby tender my resignation. Don't come looking for me. Sincerely, Kaya. The Crimson Dragon, former Captain of the 2nd Regiment of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What in the world goes on inside that woman's head?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>How many times has she quit now? I've never seen someone go through so many resignation forms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I've got to bring her back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh, no you don't! You stay right there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'll contact the relevant branches, see if they've seen her. If not, I'll go myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Sure you will. And has that ever worked?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Do you even have any idea which country she might be in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And I'm guessing you aren't about to pull some magical solution out of your sleeve?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Do you even know why she left in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I have my suspicions, but frankly, the matter confounds me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's your reason right there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You're never going to figure this out, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Figure what out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Never mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You know, I've never understood the perverse pleasure young people seem to take in being indirect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You ought to be careful. Devious speech makes for a devious mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Those who walk the path of knighthood should strive for readiness of will and clarity of mind at all times—and captains of the Holy Guard all the more so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I believe that you are capable of great things, Othima, but you are constrained by your refusal to fully commit yourself. Is this not the time to take that final step?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Mental discipline, my friend. That is the key. Refine your speech and you refine your conduct. Do this, and you will secure your place as one of the greatest knights of this or any age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Will you not walk this path with me? Now is the time to embrace your destiny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Gah! You're a lost cause!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I wasn't finished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You mean there was more?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Much more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Look... I don't see the point in thinking about men and women like they're different species. People are just people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Women make up half the world, you know? And without them, we men never would've been born in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But still, I don't know how you plan on saving Babel if you're this clueless about half of the people in it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Just some food for thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Don't come looking for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Why am I so blind to the workings of women's hearts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Don't you get it? Don't you see why I called for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Holy Order of Babel (Memories)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Um... A-a very good day to you, Most Reverend Bishop, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Please, there's no need for formalities. I am told that you are excelling in your duties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Y-you flatter me, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Top marks in the entrance examination, if I am not mistaken, and you have only continued to impress since. Some are calling you the Holy Guard's rising star.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I-I could never have done any of it without the help of my friends! I'm nothing special, really!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It has been far too long, Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I-it has, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I was hoping to congratulate you on your successes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Y-you honor me, Waginau, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Raise your head. I would see your face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I couldn't possibly! To look upon the face of the Most Reverend Bishop would be the height of disrespect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What makes you say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Respectfully, sir, you are the Most Reverend Bishop of the Holy Order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Only the highest echelons of the Church are worthy of gazing upon your face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It is an honor far beyond a humble member of the Holy Guard like myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I feel indescribably privileged to have even been permitted to hear your voice all these years!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I could never presume...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>And what if I were to order you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I... But... I couldn't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Raise your head, Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Y-yes, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Oh no, he's super cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Desist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>D-did I say that out loud?! My deepest apologies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It is unbefitting of a knight of the Holy Guard to refer to her superior as "cute".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Take pride in your achievements, Kanon, and strive for greater things. In the name of Babel, and in the name of the absolute justice you must uphold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I-I will! Thank you very much, Waginau, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Pardon me, Most Reverend Bishop. Might I interrupt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>That time already, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Eek! L-Lord Commander?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I'd entirely forgotten I'd called for you, Zain. Forgive me—my age must be catching up with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Y-you don't look old at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Oh? You flatter me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Do you have a fountain of youth hidden away somewhere?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Nothing like that. You'd be surprised at the wonders a little Alchemia can achieve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Wow! Alchemia can do that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Pardon me, Most Reverend Bishop. Might I interrupt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I'd entirely forgotten I'd called for you, Zain. Forgive me—my age must be catching up with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You can say that again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>N-nothing! Nothing at all! Um, should I be leaving now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>No, no. You may stay. In fact, I'm glad of the chance to speak with the two of you together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Um... As you wish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Apologies for keeping you waiting, Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You summoned me, Most Reverend Bishop?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Thank you for coming. I'm sure you must be extraordinarily busy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>My burden is not half as great as yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Allow me to cut to the chase.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Kaya is... starting to become a problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I concur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Hmhm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Frankly, if she continues as she is, she will end up damaging the reputation of the Church as a whole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>The usual, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>She's been sighted investigating ancient ruins all around the continent. She's currently in... Slothstein, I believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I swear, you've bolted new pieces onto that thing every time I see it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Do you like it? This is the new-and-improved Comprehensive Archaeological Surveyor Multitech Antie! Isn't it adorable?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I suppose. In a certain light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>It's not for nothing that she's called the Crimson Dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Between her extraordinary inherent powers and her unparalleled historical knowledge...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Even the previous Lord Commander would have struggled to match her on the battlefield... or so the rumors would have me believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>As someone who graduated from the same class as her, that makes me feel a little proud... and a little pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Please, Zain. Who could be an exemplar for the Holy Guard if not you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>You value proper learning and conduct in a way she does not. That is what makes you fit to be Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>You humble me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>We do not have long. There have been worrying signs from our neighbors in Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Our informants report that the tyrant emperor is marshalling his forces to sweep the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>If we are to weather this, Zain, we need Kaya. Both for her own strength and for the strength she gives you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Of course, Most Reverend Bishop. I will restore her to the Holy Guard, I swear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I am glad to hear it. The peace of the continent rests in your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I will not fail you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>As for you, young knight, I hope you're taking notes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>M-me? No! Wait, I mean... Um...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>L-Lord Commander?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Have we met?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>She is one of the orphans who was left under the Holy Order's care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>An orphan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Y-yes. I wanted to repay the Holy Order for taking me in, so I decided to join the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>As you can see, she is spirited. I have great expectations for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>I... Um... Thank you very much, Most Reverend Bishop, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>What is your name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Oh! My apologies. Kanon of the Holy Guard, reporting for duty, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I still have much to learn, but I promise I'll do my best! I won't let you down, Lord Commander, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>There's no need to get so worked up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>B-but you're my idol, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I mean, everyone loves you! You're our most righteous Lord Commander, tasked with the protection of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>You care for everyone—even the poor and helpless, like me! You're our guiding light amid the darkness of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Your... guiding light?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Yes, Lord Commander, sir! I dream of becoming a shining beacon, just like you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Perhaps then I'll be able shine my light on everyone, too! Like... Like a sparkling diamond!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I couldn't get you to smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>You shine too bright for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Without saying a word, you...</td>
