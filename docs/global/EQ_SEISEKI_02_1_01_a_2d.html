<td>Mizuchi, I'm sure he won't give up. He'll use any method he can to find us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>If worse comes to worst, save yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Don't worry, Chihaya. I'm sure this cave will be safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>After all, everyone knows this is a nesting ground for monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>He wouldn't think we'd run away here, would he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Besides, before entering here, I contacted the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, those famous knights?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes! If he uses Alchemy to harm us, I'm sure the Paladins will act on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm smart, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Heheh. You are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Besides, you've got me! We'll just have to hold on a little longer until help arrives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Let's go, Vice-Captain Kudan...whoops, I mean newly appointed Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...Come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Whoaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A lot of unnecessary moves, as usual, Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ack... I'm not giving up yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, come on! How long are you gonna do this?! Kanon, do you even know why you're here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Of course I do, Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But I made a promise that I would become stronger! I'm gonna do everything I can to become a first-class knight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>A promise? With who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's a secret!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Apparently, it was with the deceased Captain Cadanova.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ack! Why did you tell her, Captain Kudan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Because it's irrelevant to our mission; we've no more time for small talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Like Kudan said, do you really understand the purpose of our mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I told you that I do! We're going into that cave hidden up ahead, where...um, what was her name again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...Chihaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Right, Chihaya! We're going to find this person called Chihaya and save her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Indeed. According to our information, her pursuer can wield Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If we make one wrong move, it could cost us her life. This is a dangerous mission, so keep your guard up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>All right. Let's begin our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...We've arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So, Chihaya is inside this cave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yes. However, I've been told that it's a den of monsters in there. As we advance, don't let your guard down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Wow, it really is filled with monsters! Why did this Chihaya person hide in here out of all places?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Who knows? Maybe because she's an amateur?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Her way of thinking is too naive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Her intentions may have been good, but she failed to consider how her actions could bring about war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Cast aside your personal feelings, Kagura. Your unfiltered emotions will only dull your blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oki-doki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh? What was that about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I know you and the Captain were acquaintances from before, but did you also know this Chihaya person?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I've never even met her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, I see. You just sounded like you were familiar with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Anyway, just so you know, Kudan and I aren't just acquaintances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Heheheh... Just so you know, our relationship isn't that superficial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What's that supposed to mean? You're just childhood friends or something, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We're not childhood friends. Our bond goes much deeperâ™ª</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Deeper? Wa-wait... Are you saying that you two have that kind of relationship?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Why are you blushing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>W-well...I've never done anything like that yet, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Stop speaking nonsense. What do you mean by 'anything like that'?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Let's stay on subject.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Y-yes, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Chihaya is a shrine maiden who is trying to restore the land of her war-torn country. The locals trust her deeply.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>In the midst of her activities, I heard she was under attack by someone who wields Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>So, she ran away into this cave with a kid called Mizuchi, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Apparently, it was this Mizuchi who contacted the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I think I understand, but then again not really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Anyway, we just need to rescue this Chihaya and Mizuchi, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Eeek! What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>No more talk. Focus on fighting.</td>
</tr>
