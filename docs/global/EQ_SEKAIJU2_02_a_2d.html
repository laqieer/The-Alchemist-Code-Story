<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Wow! You're all so powerful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Naturally! Those who would call themselves adventurers must be strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Some things are worthy of a little pride. Your command was excellent, Sovereign.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Indeed! Gunner, your marksmanship was magnificent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Thanks for watching my back, Protector! You really saved me back there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Heheh. As a Protector, it is my duty to be the shield of any adventurer. Your swordsmanship is impressive, Fencer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm so jealous of all of you! If only I could appear as I was... I just don't feel like myself anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Are you sure? I thought you were fantastic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>R-really? Heheh... Well, I am a pirate, after all. Oh, that's right! I still don't get what's going on here, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Right. We need to explain what happened. I'll start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We are adventurers from another world. We heard a voice crying for help, and followed it here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>According to Fencer, the voice is somehow related to the linking of our worlds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A cry for help? Hmm... I can't ignore someone in trouble, even if we have to find them first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If we help them, it might fix the link between our worlds, so that we can all go home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Perhaps, but there is no guarantee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Good! Now we know what needs to be done! We must embark on an adventure to seek out the owner of that voice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'll do whatever it takes to get home—but first, it's most important for us to help the person in need!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Indeed! A motley bunch we may be, but I am counting on all of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hell yeah! U-um...? Shouldn't we be going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We should...but we have no idea where this person may be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's true. It would certainly save us some time if the person calling for help had also shouted their location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Should we try asking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Lo, there! Mysterious voice! Where are you? If you can hear me, please respond!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Um... Perhaps it would be better to start by gathering information in a nearby city or village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Indeed! Intelligence gathering is the foundation of good adventuring!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>There should be a village west of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Excellent! Then, once more, I decree our adventure begun! Let us be off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hurrah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmmm... I'm not sure how I feel about this group.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ahahahaha! It'll be all right! Ragtag groups like this make for the best of adventures!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hmph. Perhaps you're right. I suppose it's only natural to be excited at the beginning of a new adventure, after all. Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wh-what's that look for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Everything I've seen of you so far is so cool, calm, and collected...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So what you said just now was kind of surprising—and that smile of yours is really cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>D-don't be ridiculous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm not! You're definitely a passionate adventurer, just like the rest of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't make fun of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Don't worry! I'm not making fun of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Gunner! Shenmei! What are you dillydallying for?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>L-let's go, Shenmei!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I see. So you were in the middle of searching for your companions when we appeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Falling into a trap and getting separated from your group...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>An elementary mistake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh, no! How embarrassing. Hahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I hope you find them soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Me, too! Ah, that's the village up ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huh? Something seems off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Grrrrrrraaaaaaarrrrrrrgggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>M-monsters! At a time like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Civilians should take refuge indoors immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Take the infected to the Church! Quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>We will chase away the monsters! We must not let them take even a single step into the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The village is being attacked by monsters! We gotta go help out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Sh-Shenmei, wait! We need to hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Nrrrgggghhhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Grrrraaaarrrrggggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Huzzzaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You all right, soldier?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Wh-who are...? Ah! Behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Grrrrrraaarrrrrrrggggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Just in time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Gunner! Th-thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You don't need to thank me. Let's quickly take out these creatures!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
