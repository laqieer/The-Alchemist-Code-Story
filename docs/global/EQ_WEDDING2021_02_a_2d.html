<td>I'm all for getting the bandits, but we've dealt with so many in this area, haven't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's true, but they continue to create disturbances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There have been a number of sightings of bandits reported in the area ahead. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Didn't you think the outfits those two had were marvelous? I really want to perform my duties in something like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Like go on a mission dressed that way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Precisely! Don't you think it would boost your spirits and make you more motivated?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I wonder... I can understand the desire to wear fancy high-quality clothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But I don't know that it would be useful for us now. We do not need flamboyant frills to crack bandit skulls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sure, but if you had particularly cute attire, don't you think it'd make you feel stronger?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You think a pretty outfit would make me stronger? Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Absolutely! Cuteness is righteous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We can discuss it more later. For now, we must do something about those dirty bandits!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We cannot allow them to disrupt the bridal fair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What is the big deal with this fair anyway? The town seems really excited about it, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well, if it's cancelled, then all the cute clothes and decorations will go to waste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Everyone's worked so hard to put on a fantastic event, and we cannot let that hard work be ruined by some bandits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So I'm going to do something about it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You have such a kind heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And I agree. I want everyone's hard work to be rewarded, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Excellent! I think the visitors are all really looking forward to the festivities. I heard it was quite lively in the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wasn't there a couple planning to wed at the fair? Not just a rehearsal but the real thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I do recall there being talk of it earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>How marvelous! The loving couple will be embarking on the road to a happy life together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The staff seem to have really done their best to ensure that the ceremony will be unforgettable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I really don't want to see them cancelled, so we must make sure the fair is held and not let the bandits get in the way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The road to a happy life...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(Once, I used to think about that. I thought it was my duty to dance with all my heart for the sake of that happiness.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(But...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Now, I offer up a prayer dance to the god of Wadatasumi, who has watched over the wedding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I pray for the growth of both families, and that those who are to wed find unending happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>God of Wadatsumi hear me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Chihaya really is a wonderful dancer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Such a splendid performance will certainly strengthen the bond between the two families.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I believe you're right. Chihaya's movements have real power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Happy day! Happy day! Now, both families can be free from worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(That day I performed my first dance for a wedding ceremony.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(It acted as a prayer to celebrate the newlyweds and solidify the bond between their families.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(Listening to the joyous voices of family members, I threw myself into the dance...and I caught a glimpse of the bride's face.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Chihaya? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Well, let's go. We still have a duty to perform.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
