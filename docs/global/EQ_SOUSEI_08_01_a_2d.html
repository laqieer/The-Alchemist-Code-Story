<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Are you serious, Father?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It is the will of the proud people of Superbia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We have no gods to watch over us now, so this is the path the people have chosen for themselves. It is their future to shape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But it's our job as high elves to help guide them along that path, is it not?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes, that is indeed the task we were entrusted with by the dragons who came before us. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Humans must determine their own fate. The world, as it progresses, belongs to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I understand that. I do. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What if they make the wrong choices? What if they regret what they've decided upon, and wish to take back their past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Then they are free to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Humans have the right to control the world's destiny. But with that right comes the responsibility to bear the burdens of the changes they have brought about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Then what about him? Why did you decide to take him in, and raise him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If you knew such a decision was to be made from the very start, then what was the point?! That isn't mercy—it's cruelty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Helene...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We've had to do as that snake girl says, and she even gave him that name...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's all for the remaking of the world, my dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's what all the humans, high elves, and even dragons have sacrificed everything for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But I haven't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Then how about this, my child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If you should ever find the right path—the one that promises to lead humans onward to their best possible future—I implore you to choose it for yourself as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Do what you must to defend those who must be protected. Do what's needed for the sake of your mission. Even if you must one day fell me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Promise me, child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Father...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I promise. No matter what I must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The winds are as strong as ever today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's almost as if the gales act with malice of forethought, to obscure our future...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Will there really come a day when these winds will cease?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Helene?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Nimul? What are you doing in a place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well... I'm staring at the sky. Wondering when that lid will ever open.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We are doing our best to make that happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I know. But still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I wasn't the chosen one. It wasn't me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So... Well, I can't help but wonder if our true savior really even exists beyond this sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I couldn't say for certain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But what is certain, regardless of who was chosen, is that you are my beloved brother. Nothing can ever take that away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Come, now. We should return home. This magil-infused wind is poisonous to humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(He still has a future. No... Not just him. Everyone who lives in this Belt Region does.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(Things can't end yet. I won't let them.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'll protect everyone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hmm? Did you say something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No. Nothing at all. Come on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Sorry for the trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. I'm just glad you're back, safe and sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>So, this is what Avaritia Belt was like before, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yes. The city is almost completely restored already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Or rather, replaced, I suppose. There have certainly been some fundamental changes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Its people no longer crave power. Or to be more precise, they now seek power in an altogether different form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That's what this era's Benika told me, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I guess we really did change the timeline. No more Lord Kuvera, for starters...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>But beyond that, defeating the Cursed Beast was certainly bound to alter the region all on its own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I...have completely changed your homeland, haven't I? I'm so sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Change isn't always bad. Particularly when some things could have only been saved through it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Do you want to go back home, at least? That way, you can see—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>No, I don't. I made my peace with everything already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'm glad enough to know that you cared for her in her final moments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>She didn't have many friends she trusted enough to really open up to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I'm sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I just want to see what things are like now. I want to confirm for myself that this wasn't all for nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Yeah. After all that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>All right. Here we are; right back where we started.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Even the parts of town that were destroyed are back to how they were before. Or, I suppose, they've already been reconstructed. So much time has already passed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The power to move freely through time is truly a fearsome one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It has its drawbacks, though. A power like that is inundated with restrictions. Space-Time Manipulators place even further restrictions upon themselves, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Ambrosia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I made an exception for you. I've broken the restrictions I placed on myself in direct response to my foolish apprentice's gross misconduct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>However, this power is not to be taken lightly. Misuse of it could lead to...incalculable loss. It must be handled with all due respect and care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I'll remember that well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That goes double for you, Mira! And you too, Nyx!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Don't worry. We have no intention of abusing this power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Are you sure about that, or are you just saying that so I'll lay off of you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Rude! It wouldn't hurt to trust us a little more, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I think it just might! Particularly in your case. You'd best not even think about using this technique to travel back in time and get more snacks, or something equally frivolous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What do you take me for?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I am truly grateful to you. The next thing to do, then, is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Ah, the search for your sister. You never did manage to find her, did you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>No. Not yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I mentioned this before, but these lands have the power to correct the flow of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>If she still lives, she should be drifting about somewhere in this era.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>We should be able to search for her, at the very least. We do have a mode of transportation around the region, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>What are you looking at me for? I was just about to start heading back to Acedia Belt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You're not going anywhere, motorcycle man. Those in possession of convenient powers and technologies should be prepared to use them to the last!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Ugh. Fine, whatever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>We'll go around the other regions to see if Emmel is there. In the meantime, the rest of you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>We'll head to Superbia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Are we really going back there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Yes. Lord Kuvera instructed us to do so with his final words, and there is still the chance that Emmel has drifted to that Belt Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Never thought I'd be setting foot on those lands again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Oh, yeah. You used to be part of the Infinite Serpent, right? Is there anything we should be aware of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>You're going to have to use dust-warding magic while you're there. The winds are extremely powerful, to the extent that it's much like being in a perpetual sandstorm. And a poisonous one, at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Furthermore, don't expect anyone there to be particularly...forthcoming. Keep your trust in check.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>All the inhabitants of that region are strict adherents to the Infinite Serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>All of them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Blasted Minario... Look what you've done to my poor baby!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>There we go. That seems like it'll do the job, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I've finished connecting the airship to the new Libra. It should run just like before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Excellent! Everything should be ready, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>It's like a man-made ark...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Gah! You startled me. Don't skulk around like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I've been here the entire time. You must be woefully unobservant to have not noticed my presence until now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Ugh, I'll notice your presence, you little—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Zafeiris, is it true that you have a spectral dragon body?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>That is correct. Right now, I am nothing but a spirit. I am no more than the imperfect echoes of bygone thoughts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You're pretty clear-minded and solid for a mere apparition, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>That is thanks to the strong will my host body possesses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>So the reason this guy's so annoying is because of Waginau? Hey, Waginau, you might want to discipline your pet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Don't speak as if I'm his owner! I'm no happier about this arrangement than you are, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>He does help during battles, but other than that, he usually just haphazardly wanders off and gets himself into trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>So, what are you doing here now? What do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I have no particular reason for showing up. I was simply observing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Observing what, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Our princess has acknowledged you humans as beings of worth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I simply wished to know how she arrived at such a conclusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>You're probably better off looking to Nimul for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I already know his worth. His powers of Alchemy, which allow for humans to enact true change, are terrifying even to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>However, he himself does not acknowledge that worth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>It almost seems as if he feels there is something even more valuable in this world than he.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Yeah, probably Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>He does kind of obsess over her. Bit of a sister complex on that one, if you ask me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>You're one to talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Nimul believes that everyone who lives in the seven regions has the ability to one day overcome their sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Does he? Sin magil eats away at us all, including the princess—the being most revered among us dragons, whom even you humans regard as a goddess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Yet you truly believe your kind holds the power to overcome such a universal force?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>That's what we've been fighting for, under Nimul's banner: that we may light the path to that eventual victory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>They will undoubtedly overcome it. That is what I am here for...and why you are here as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>We, the Infinite Serpent, are this world's final sacrificial offering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>The dear girl you brought forth—the Primordial Serpent—surely wishes for the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>You are certainly an amusing bunch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>What the...?! Ugh, how unpleasant, mumbling something cryptically sinister and then scurrying off...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I don't care for people like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Now, now. Best to leave him be. He didn't seem to have any ill intent, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>It's the principle of it, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Zafeiris...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>O Princess...Primordial Serpent, diviner of all Truth in heaven and earth alike...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Your power flows through the gentle wind, the lush flora, the murmuring rivers, and the sun in the sky...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Which will make your descent into sin all the more devastating to this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>There must be a way to stop that from happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Nimul, Pursuer of Gluttony. What is it you seek as you covetously devour all the knowledge of the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I seek a future where all can live in joyful harmony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Do you mean to say, all humankind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Then you must intend to hold the Ceremony of Creation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Yes. That is my aim.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Bianca referenced that as the sole means of saving this world, but what exactly is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>It's exactly as it sounds. It is a ceremony by which the world can be created anew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Long ago, in a time when calamity rained down upon the dragons and brought us to the very brink of extinction, it did just that, altering heaven and earth alike on our behalf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>The time of the dragons...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Beings who determined the law of the land, much as Nidhogg did in the Gula Belt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>It's hard to imagine a time before humans became the dominant force, when dragons ruled the land...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>I guess you really are one of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Of course! Though I am but a phantom now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>We are no more, ruined by our own hubris and our decision to step off the path we were supposed to follow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Why did your kind try to bring corruption to Gula Belt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>The Fallen cannot give birth to sin. They are born from sin, but they do not birth any themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Yet despite wallowing within it, they also consume it for sustenance, serving to purify this world in the process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>They eat sin? That explains a few things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>You were basically allowing us to be consumed by sin so we could do the dirty work of clearing sin magil from the world, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>It was the simplest way to protect the world's order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Such arrogance! We humans decide our own futures through our free will. We have the right to choose what tomorrow will bring through our actions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>And you worked to take that away from us by force. You manipulated us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>That free will is the reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>That strong will and determination you humans possess—the will to overcome hardships, and to survive even in the face of unimaginable struggle... We dragons lacked that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>We gained power and surpassed all other beings...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>But in doing so, we lost the strength that we were supposed to inherently possess as living beings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>That's why we clung to our "God."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>We prayed to our fabricated god for the power to overcome the calamities which threatened to destroy us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>We tried to bring back the lives that were lost and the blood that was spilled by restoring the torn skies and the broken earth, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>You failed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>That was the moment of our end. We stared down the inevitability of our extinction as we realized the one power we didn't have was the power to resurrect the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>There were beings from an outside world you could call upon. And perhaps those humans might be able to do what you could not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>The possibility was there. And we believe that fragmented piece of the Primordial Serpent is striving to do the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>But for this to succeed, a sacrifice would be required. One of such magnitude that it absolutely could not go unnoticed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
