<td>Even if that makes me a disgrace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>And I'm sure all the people I've killed would tell me that it does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>These aren't crimes that you can atone for. Not even in the afterlife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So, what do you do? You bear the burden, no matter how torturous. You shoulder these sins for as long as you live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>This is my job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm sure you know that, since you're here and all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I do. In fact, that's what brings me here. I want to commission you, Master Yogi. Your skills with the forge are legendary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm not forgin' a sword for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Go ask someone else, eh? I only forge for the people I've got a contract with, and you're not one of 'em.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I can't break the taboo. It goes against my code of duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ahahahahaha! Hee hee hee...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Who's this, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>She's my wife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What? And you carried her all the way here, to this volcano? From war-torn Wadatsumi, all the way across the continent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What's wrong with her? Ain't there a cure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>She is broken beyond repair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Have you considered finding her a...facility?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't even know if there is one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>She's not goin' to last long like that, what with you cartin' her all over the place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>She's a shrine maiden, isn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Her kind are bein' hunted all over the world now, thanks to that announcement out of Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Not to be rude, but you're goin' to have a hard time fightin' off her attackers with her on your back like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And the whole world's her enemy now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That is exactly why I need a sword that will lose to no other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What do you mean by that, boy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Mitsu taught me that even if you don't know the answer to your question or the solution to your problem, you just have to keep going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>She always gave me strength. She was the one who transformed me from a hollow vessel into a man with a reason to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>She brought so much warmth into my life, where once there was only the cold grip of a cruel master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So I cannot, and will not, abandon herâ€”no matter what trials we face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You'd make an enemy of the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If the world would harm the one I love...gladly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>She is all I have. All I want is for her to survive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That is why I need a sword that will not falter, even when I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>An unbeatable, invincible katana!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>All this, for her sake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Make light of me if you wish. I do not care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hm? What're you plannin' to do with that broken katana?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I want to prove to you that I will not bring shame upon the blade you forge me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh? And how do you intend to do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I cannot build graves in tribute to my family. However, I do not want to entrust their memory to reminiscence alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>To ensure that I never forget them, for as long as it takes me to find the answers I seek, I require a token...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>S-stop! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Which I shall carve into my flesh by my own will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>In place of stone, this cross shall be their grave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It is a symbol of my commitment and determination to continue fighting, until I can find a way to heal my wife, and until I reach my truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>All right, all right. Spare me the theatrics. I'm the man who forges swords that save the world, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But...I suppose I could make an exception for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hmph. This will be the first and last katana I forge for a man whose enemy is the world, and who swings his blade to save the woman he loves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Thank you. I am in your debt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Don't mention it. It'll help balance things out a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Aha... Hahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Come, now, lass, don't laugh at the poor man. He's lost enough. He deserves to keep his pride, at least, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Do you remember me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>All healed up, I take it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>More or less. I suppose I have you to thank for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You were dead to the world for some time. I very nearly did forget about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Wadatsumi is ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It's all thanks to you and the Imperial Elite Guard. Your vanguard party laid the groundwork for our path of conquest. Now all we need to do is finish routing the few remaining resistance groups.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Well, at least these injuries weren't for nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Where is my daylily?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Wh-what do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Your wounds were clearly his handiwork.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Not only that, but we have yet to find the corpse of his shrine maiden wench.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I expect a detailed and accurate report, commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>(I really am worthless.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>(What use is regret now? What's done is done.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>(I destroyed their family, as I have many others'. All the guilt in the world could not restore to them what they've lost.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You should be grateful. I'm giving you an opportunity to get your revenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Y-you mean...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>We are currently investigating D. Lily's whereabouts. This time, you will not fail to bring me his head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>In the meantime, I'd like you to assist me in routing the remaining rebel forces. That should be a simple enough task for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>What? Don't think you can handle it? You're not still recovering, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>No... I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>What do you think you're doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I doubt I can ever make up for what I've done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I can't change the past. I can't undo what I've done. No one's ever going to forgive me, no matter what I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>But still, I... I can't do this anymore. I can't be your tool anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>You dare betray me? You would follow D. Lily's example, even after seeing what it cost him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Survival of the fittest, remember? Only strength and power matter in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Hmph. You don't know the meaning of the words. You're of the same lowly stock as your mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I want you to leave D. Lily alone, and stop slaughtering innocent shrine maidens! Just forget your plans of conquest and domination, and turn your attention to peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>You can't be serious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I don't know whose sympathies have addled your brains, but I tire of being lectured by mass murderers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Do you think the parents of the children you have killed will forgive you if you only beg them to, and tell them you've sworn off murder for good?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Do you think you'll be given the opportunity for a fresh start if you only declare that you'll never kill again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>No one would believe you. No one would let you. No one would forgive you. Not even if you blubber a thousand apologies. Not even after your death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Perhaps...but that's not going to stop me from trying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I'm going to find a way to repay the people I've hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>You're only serving yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I know. But I can't stand this anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Heh... Hahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Hahahahahaha! Another one! I can hardly believe it. First my daylily, then his successor! Traitors, the pair of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>It seems that every tool I deign to depend upon is destined to turn against me! Hahahaha! How absurd!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Would that I believed in coincidences... But, alas, it would seem my own skills are to blame. I ought to have learnt by now how to wield my tools without injuring myself. What a fool I've been! I could kick myself, if it wasn't so hilarious! Hahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Laugh all you like. I've made my decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>So...you, too, have developed a soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Come, let us end this. Any last words, whelp?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Goodbye.</td>
</tr>
