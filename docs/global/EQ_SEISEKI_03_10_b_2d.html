<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Your power far surpasses my expectations. Wonderful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This will end it all. Rest in peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's a request I cannot satisfy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh no! He's gonna try to run away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Now, now. Don't make me sound like a coward. There's such a thing as timing, and I have now outstayed my welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You know where the Sacred Stone is located. I have gained more than enough from that information alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Enjoy your fleeting peace while you can. Next time, things will not go as well for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ack. No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I won't let you escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's too late. He's already disappeared. More importantly, we should get to Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You're right. Let's rendezvous with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, it's you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You're safe! Seriously! Don't go off on your own like that! You scared me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Where's the enemy? Where is the major enemy that you were chasing? Did they escape?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>He's not here. I eradicated him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You eradicated him? In other words, you defeated him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What else could I mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah! I wouldn't expect any less from you, Kudan! I guess that means we've completed our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes... Let's go home, everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Kudan...there's something I want to ask you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You said that you defeated a major enemy who was moving about suspiciously. Is that true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Why would I lie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There are no traces of this opponent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Knowing your strength, I have little doubt that you could completely eradicate someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>However, there should be some trace left behind. I can't see anything here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>There aren't even traces of a battle. What happened here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Who knows? Unfortunately, I don't have the answers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You did it, Captain Kudan! Vice-Captain Monzein! Let's celebrate once we get back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yes...let's do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Stop getting carried away, Kanon! We don't know when the monsters might attack again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yeah, Yeah. I'm well aware of that, Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Was it not Orion who was after the Sacred Stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I received information that he is looking for the Sacred Stone. What did you talk with him about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...Who knows?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Why are you feigning ignorance? This situation could very well turn into a war. We need to share information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Monzein...don't you feel it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Feel what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This emptiness. No matter how much we fight for justice, evil does not disappear from this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>All of this is due to our lack of power. Have you not felt the same? If...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>If I could obtain absolute power...then I could protect everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Kudan, Vice-Captain?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What's got into the two of them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Nothing. They're always like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>They'll settle it eventually, so go on ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Please. Arguing here will be inefficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Fine. Kanon! Come on, let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Huh?! Hold on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Seida, were you listening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yes. Reluctantly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Forget it all. This is my order to you as Vice-Captain. I also forbid you from telling the others. Do you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Kudan...I will pretend like I didn't hear what you just said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Open your eyes. There are those who rely on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'm sorry. Something was wrong with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>As you long as you understand now. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I must determine the true nature of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Heheh. According to how I use him, he could be an interesting tool to work with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Heheheh.</td>
</tr>
