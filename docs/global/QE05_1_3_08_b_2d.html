<td>"I beseech the supreme..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>"The kingdom shall inherit the crown, and the heavenly gates shall open for the souls of the pure. Save us, heal us, spare us!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>"Sephiron, our great Mother, the Tree of Life, crowned supreme, we who pass into temptation, beyond the tertium sephirah, beyond the crossroads."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>"Save us, the lost souls!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Urk! I must—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Kamui, stop! This corruption cannot be fully purified. It's been collecting in Sephiron for thousands of years!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The only one who can heal the tree is the druidic priestess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No, I'm not done yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's enough, Kamui. Having you here, in the end, this is all I could ever hope for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No...no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, great tree, I give myself to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Noooo!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heh heh... It's happening. I can hear it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Sephiron is coming back to life! The ancient door is opening to swallow the curse of Beelzebub!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Great Sephiron, have you realized yet? The one you chose as a sacrifice is the Vessel of Reincarnation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It is finally achieved, the equilibrium! The balance between the Sacred Stone's curse and the great tree's purifying energy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This is what will finally bring about the awakening of the Vessel of Compassion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Finally... Finally, true justice can be brought to this—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Canon fire?! They're targeting Sephiron! Who—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Gluttony's soldiers... The Royal Army?! How did they find the village?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Heh heh. It seems like the tides have turned, Lord Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ceclidis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>As both Bishop and Paladin of the Holy Guard, your authority has always presented an obstacle to our plans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You'd most certainly have become an eyesore in our upcoming collaboration with Greed Dike. I humbly request that you...disappear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Greed Dike? I see, so you intend to oppose the peace we the, Holy Guard, fight so diligently to maintain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I knew you were an ambitious one, but I never thought you were so drunk with greed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This continent is mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It is only natural for me to desire all I may have. After all, Gluttony is the essence of this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I concede the point. That does not, however, explain your presence here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I believe I ordered you to side with King Narol to subdue this civil war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>They have joined me instead, though we do not share the same goals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I suppose you could call it a temporary alliance until you Paladins have been eradicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Lord Waginau, we are tired. You have preached about the return of the will of god, but this road you have led us on never seems to end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The task you have given us is far too excruciating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Flushing out elements of discord, instigating rebellion through them, then wiping them out. That will never end the bloodshed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You continue to shed blood to vindicate your justice... We can no longer follow your lead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If blood must flow for the sake of justice—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If that is the way of the world, then we renounce that justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No matter if we are considered evil or mistaken in the end, we choose this path in the hopes that it might bring peace and save the people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Lord Waginau, we draw our swords against your justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It seems I left you to your own devices for too long. Never did I expect such gutless idealism among the Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Gutless?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's what I said. Gutless. Spilling blood is all we know how to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That is our self-evident truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I created the Corpse as a way to protect the purity of justice in the face of evil and spite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Now look at you. You are now simply a mirror of the world I created you to destroy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You are no different from the foolish optimists that govern the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If I allow this to continue, I cannot show my face to those who are destined to return here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Both you, General Ceclidis, and those of you who have forsaken the Corpse have willingly painted yourselves with the same sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It is my duty to punish you all and let the darkness engulf the guilty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You think so little of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You should not take me so lightly. What made you think I wouldn't have come prepared for your alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You nullified... No! Absorbed my Spiritbonding?! That stone in your hand...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Enough talk! Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Do not worry, General Ceclidis will burn your precious old tree down after you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I don't have time to chat. It's time. Out with the old and in with the new!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>No! We must protect the great tree Sephiron somehow!</td>
</tr>
