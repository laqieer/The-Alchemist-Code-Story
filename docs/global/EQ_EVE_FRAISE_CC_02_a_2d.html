<td>A Few Days Later</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>…I didn't tell Moa that I went back to Eve's house. There was something about her I needed to investigate further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>If something's going on, I want to help. She's doing her best to break the curse to be with the person she loves...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yet she doesn't conform to society's expectations. I want someone as determined as she is to have all her hard work pay off…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>…Hm? What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I told you! I don't want to be a scout! I have no interest in joining any order of knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…That's fine. However--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is a critical moment for Lustburg. I wouldn't want one of our own giving aid to other countries--like Envylia, for example.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Like I said…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…At any rate, once we shut down our borders, you won't be able to wander around aimlessly like before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Stop wasting your time with that "Bridal Training," or whatever you call it, and just turn him into an insect already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A-An insect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>As long as you have children, we won't give you any grief. They'll become an asset to our country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Besides don't you want to leave behind a legacy--all the more so with the man you love?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(What's with that tone…I don’t like how she's speaking to her.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(…And why isn't Eve speaking up? She tore into that witch the other day.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>At any rate, think it over. You're a woman of Lustburg, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>…*Sigh*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>…Um…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>! R-Rachel! What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Sorry to drop by without warning. I was wondering if we could talk… What happened just now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh that…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>They've been coming here a lot lately. Seems like they want to keep an eye on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>My guess is that it's because I used to be scouted by other countries to join their order of knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>"Never act on behalf of another country! Always behave like a proper woman of Lustburg!" That's what they say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yeesh… What gives them any right to say that sort of thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…Lustburg witches are so pushy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Aren't they? I couldn't agree more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I think what they say sounds totally unreasonable…but at the same time I sort of understand where they're coming from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Lustburg may have fared better than others during the Lion Monarch's Charge, but we still suffered. So, I understand the instinct to be weary of other countries and want to protect our own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>They're not bad people. They're doing their best for their country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…That doesn't mean they can do whatever they want in the name of national security.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>True…but I'm sure it isn't easy protecting an entire country!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Look at Fraise. He's constantly working to protect Envylia. When I think of that, this kind of thing doesn't get to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Sure, they're trying to protect their country, but…still…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(That doesn't give them the right to harass their own citizens. Right?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hey, Rach. Please don't tell Moa about what happened today, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>She finally cheered up, so I don't want her worrying on my account. Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>…If that's what you want, then you should make up with Fraise. I think that'll make her happy, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>…Sorry. I know it's wrong, but… I work part time delivering letters, and…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's why I know--that you and Fraise haven't been exchanging letters lately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Lately, the higher ups have been checking mail a lot, so at first I thought they were blocking you. But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>…I-It's just a coincidence! Just bad timing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>…Then may I take the letter on your desk? I can deliver it for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Once the borders are closed it'll be even more difficult to send letters. You've got to tell him how you feel before that happens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Y-You may be right…but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>…My mom always said if you have something to say to somebody, then say it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If you don't, you'll regret it when it's too late. As long as there's someone you have something tell, you should try to tell them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Your mom said that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>She was the kind of person that would go to the forest with a bunch of food in case my dad, who had become an insect, was hungry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Sounds like a wonderful woman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yeah, well, thanks to that, the witches took all the insects in the area--for experimentation. Apparently, they grew TOO well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…How awful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>But…I still think my mom had the right idea. Even if that idea was at odds with the country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>My mom was true to herself and the one she loved. That's why I think she was so cool…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>…Ah, sorry! Look at me going on and on about myself. We're talking about you right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>…Rach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Anyway, I don't want you to give up! I want you to acknowledge your feelings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Otherwise, someday…I'm sure you'll regret it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…That means a lot, Rach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>But…it's done! I've already made up my mind! Because…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Made up your mind… But don’t you love Fraise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>W-Well…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I……......ADORE him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Then…In that case, I'll help you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Oh! My letter…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'll be taking this. It's my duty as a delivery person to make sure your letter arrives safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>EEEEK! W-Wait a minute! I'm not mentally prepared for this…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>…That reminds me. Moa told me what an absolutely amazing person Fraise is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>She did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>He's kind and handsome and, to top it all off, he's a super elite knight! What a stud!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>A knight who fights with pride is so dreamy, don't you think? I sure wouldn't mind if he rescued me, once or twice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Uh…Er…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I mean if you're not serious about him, I guess he's up for grabs, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>R-Rach?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Don't come crying if things turn out that way--</td>
</tr>
