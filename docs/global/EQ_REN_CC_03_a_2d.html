<td>About the code. About my sister.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I still think about it now. If I had been able to face everything...</td>

<td>Please leave Lady Natsume's care to me. You shouldn't have to be bothered with things like—</td>

<td>It's fine. We should change the bandages on her hands.</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ren...</td>

<td>Stop bothering the servant. I can get by fine on my own.</td>

<td>Natsume! You need to lie down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I don't like that I'm making you make that face. I know that it can't be helped, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Also, as long as I'm laid up, your training is being delayed.</td>
</tr>

<td>Who cares about that right now? Your health is—</td>

<tr>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Urgh... Natsume, are you sure you're not a demon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're fine if you can make jokes like that. Let's start your training.</td>

<tr>

<td>What is it, Ren?</td>

<tr>
<td>020</td>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(Maybe I could extend my sister's life, even just a little bit.)</td>

<td>Natsume, I...</td>

<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'll be there. You rest, Natsume.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I won't. Killing demons is part of the code.</td>

<td>Natsume!</td>
