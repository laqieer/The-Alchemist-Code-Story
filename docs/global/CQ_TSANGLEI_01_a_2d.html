<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Why?! Why can't I win?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Tsang Lei...you are quite powerful—but you are still lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What do you believe you will gain at the end of your struggle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Winning is everything! It is only because I am unbeatable that those who have once avoided me now obey me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It is unfortunate that you have yet to ascertain your true purpose despite your victories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Gaining power for the sake of power is different from gaining power for a specific purpose. You are weak because you have not yet come to understand this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Averting your eyes from what you must become, allowing your rage to drive you... How is this any different from a child throwing a tantrum?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That is why—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Rrraaaaaaagh! Shut up, you stupid monk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It was just...a dream. I left Greed Dike behind me. Must it haunt me like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Whatever! I'm free now! I'm finally free from that suffocating temple!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Calling me weak... I'll show that stupid monk! I'll become far more powerful than he could ever dream of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Now I can finally go out and challenge warriors all around the world! This is what I've been waiting for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Fighting the toughest warriors out there will surely make me stronger than ever before! Strength is justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That man's form, his look...his eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Those are the eyes of a warrior. I bet he would make a worthy opponent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(Good, good... That overflowing spirit...his willingness to kill is palpable!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You don't look like someone from around here. You must be one of the poachers who have been plaguing this forest as of late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Poacher? You've got the wrong guy. Don't get me confused with a boorish bunch like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>My name is Tsang Lei! I am he who lays waste to all those who stand against him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I can see that you are a formidable warrior. I challenge you to a duel! Prepare yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So...you're not a poacher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hey! Where are you going?! Hold it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What do you mean, "What?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Where did all that deadly spirit go?! I was ready for a fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Deadly...? Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The only reason you would have felt anything like that from me was because I mistook you for a poacher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I will not forgive those who disrupt the harmony of the forest. If I find you to be a threat to the forest, then I will destroy you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Why would I do a thing like that? I just want to fight warriors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Right. So you are not a poacher, nor do you intend to cause this forest any harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Then I have no reason to fight you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What?! Of course you do! How can two warriors not fight the moment they face one another?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Those who pursue power shouldn't be able to resist the urge to fight a formidable foe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I have no such urge. I find no joy in combat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You're a warrior with no love for combat? What the hell's wrong with you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Tch... This is such a drag. I was really hoping for a good fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That is not my prerogat—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You were saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Quiet, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hm... There are a few of them. Probably bandits who have a camp in the area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Could they be the poachers? If they are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You're gonna go for it? To be honest, they wouldn't satiate my appetite at all, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I know! This gives me a chance to show him what I can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>He'll definitely want to fight me once he sees my power!</td>
</tr>
