<td>Reido?! Are you all right?! That sounded really painful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Don't worry about it, Reida. It's just a cough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I can't just let it go! What would I do without you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Here, have some tea. It’s supposed to be very good for you, so I ordered it in specially.</td>

<td>(Reido fades away a little more every day, hour by hour. It's...surprisingly beautiful.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I was just distracted by how pale you are. Your skin is almost translucent. It's rather...pretty.</td>

<td>Oh.</td>

<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm sorry! I know it's terrible of me to think such things when you're suffering so much!</td>

<td>No, it's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm the one who should be sorry. I'm just a burden to you all the time. It is...frustrating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What are you saying?! Reido, you are everything to me! You're no burden at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I will always be at your side, no matter what happens. The only thing you have to worry about is getting better.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Reido, what did I just say? I don't see you as a trouble or a burden!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Just listen to me, all right? I'm with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Thank you... Urgh! Hrmgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Reido?! Are you alright? You should retire for the day and rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ack... That's a...good idea. I'll do just that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Reido...</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Heheh... Now that it's nighttime, some of my strength has returned. Heheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Now, it is time. With these hands, I will destroy the evil that has infested this world. Those despicable cretins who dared lay their hands on my sister will meet their demise at my fingertips...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Heh...heheheh... It is times like these when I can seek revenge on the world for treating Reida so indelicately that I know that my existence has value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yes... The night is my domain. This is when the chains that usually bind me fall away and I am free. Time to hunt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Heh...heheh... You... You are the ones who have been causing a ruckus in this area, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hooligans... I will not forgive you for casting your dirty eyes on Reida! Die!</td>
</tr>
