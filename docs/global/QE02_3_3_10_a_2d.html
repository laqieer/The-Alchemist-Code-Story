<td>You comb head! You used my right arm as a shield, didn't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Heh. What other use does that arm of yours have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You...! Mark my words; you'll pay for this once we get out of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>More importantly, look at this! There's a door!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It looks like we've arrived. Alvarez should be on the other side of this door.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Are you scared of him? Well, he did try to rob you of your future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No, I'm okay. I must pave my own path forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Right now, I'm determined to overcome any difficulty!</td>

<td>It's just Alvarez's voice! Tsk. He's fooled us again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Heheh. It's been a while, gunslinger. The last time I saw you was when you escaped at the cliff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The cliff? I see. The first Alkaroid I ran into, huh? You've become quite the chatterbox.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hehe. The abilities of us Alkaroids are constantly being updated.</td>

<td>What takes you humans tens of thousands of years to evolve into, we can accomplish in mere days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'd like to stick around and hear your bragging, but unfortunately, we're out of time. Where's Ethan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Heheh. You just missed him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Tsk! Tango! Take Ronnie and the little lady outside the room...hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well then, let's begin! This time I'll make sure to eradicate you!</td>
