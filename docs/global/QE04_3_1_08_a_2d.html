<td>Hmph. You are far too inadequate to speak of changing the future. Before you make such bombastic claims, I'd suggest spending more time improving your prospects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wait, Tehre!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...Fuu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>When I returned I couldn't find any of you. Well then, Tehre, do you intend to break the law of Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...This is a summons to the Sprite Trio Discourse. Accept it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If I don't, will you kill me? Just like you killed Alia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmph! Did you think you could beat me? You've still got a lot to learn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You still had a gun...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That doesn't make me a coward. I worked hard to get to this level of skill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I am weaker than you, but I am resourceful enough to figure out ways to defeat you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...Tehre.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Alia entrusted Saga to you...and now look at your wretched state!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...Don't forget. I still haven't forgiven you for killing Alia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tehre, I have no words to respond to that. All I have to say is this: as you know, Saga is in a crisis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Can you not find it within yourself to lend us your strength...Tehre?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...Hyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...Hnnnng!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Fuu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Now is not yet the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Then what would you have us do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Sit back...and watch me protect Saga without your assistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You say you wish to protect Saga, yet you have joined forces with the Gluttony army!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>In order to protect Saga, I would join forces with all that is evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I am certain...that is what Alia would've wanted!</td>
