<td>Heheh! This way! Catch me if you can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Eek! I-I'm sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Lord Gilfred? Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(Another frightened child... It's always wearying to see.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You...! Inquisitor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I take it you know why I am here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Begin the inspection! Show no mercy to those who will sow disorder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>H-hey! Stop! Sure, we study Alchemy here, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We've never done anything that goes against the Magna Code! You have no right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We're not here to take statements. We have all the evidence we need. All we need from you is honest answers to our inquiries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...Fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Does this laboratory allow entry to those besides the affiliated researchers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Of course not. We deal with confidential information here, so only certified researchers are allowed in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, excluding Inquisitors, I suppose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Are your researchers present every day?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Every day...? Well, no. Sometimes we go out on the field, or have days off if we're sick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Most of them are here today... Oh, except Bill. He's not in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>He's still new here. He's never had to work in a laboratory like this, so we're still teaching him the ropes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hey! Hey! Careful with that! Those are important research materials!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Keep your distance. We cannot allow you the chance to conceal evidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You can stop it with your accusations. I'm just asking them to be more careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>To be honest, I don't like letting people who don't understand the value of these materials touch them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Besides, we have nothing to hide here. We're totally legitimate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's for us to decide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Try to refrain from interrupting the inspection. Just stay back and answer my questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We aren't researching how to use Alchemy. We're just trying to gain more knowledge about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Everybody here takes pride in their work. We believe our work here will pave the way for the future of this continent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The future of this continent, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(It is true, a deeper understanding of Alchemy would benefit all of Babel. There is no doubt of that.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(But great power must be handled with care. We cannot afford to let anything go wrong. The victims of these mistakes are alwaysâ€”)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Waaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Is that...a child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hey, you! What do you think you're doing to that kid?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Shut up! This kid's been wakin' me up from my nap, runnin' around makin' a racket!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Are you serious?! This is a park! Of course kids are gonna be running around playing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I said, shut up! I don't give a damn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hey?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I see you can't even be bothered to lace your shoes properly, let alone show some common decency.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Allow me to show you what happens to egocentric ruffians who disturb the peace.</td>
