<td>Grraaaah! Agraaaahhh!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Haa...haa...! W-we did it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Phew! We made it! Y'know, for a therian, you're not bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh? Um...thanks! Hee hee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You fought incredibly well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I guess I did! Seeing how strong your commitment to Envylia is... I was reminded of someone who once died to protect me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I remembered how he was fully prepared to put his life on the line for what he believed in, and I realized...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The very thing that I'm missing is the same thing that both of you have in common.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I bet that's what Sir Gerald saw in me too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Probably. He's not the kind of person to make judgments based on race, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If you lack conviction, you will falter—and that often means death. You cannot hope to protect anyone like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I understand that now. I've also realized that I had no idea what a real fight meant until today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Haha. I bet I'd be in for a tough fight if I went up against you now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Although, I suppose there are still walls you'll have to climb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I might be a therian—but that doesn't matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Today I learned that if everyone works together to overcome something, no difficulty is too great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm sure that the same can be said for the obstacles I'll face as a therian!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I want to overcome those obstacles, and use my experiences to bridge the walls between us and connect everyone together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I see. So those are your convictions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I don't think Sir Gerald is ready to forgive the therians who abandoned his father even now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yet he has still treated me no differently than he would have if I were a human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>All he cares about is whether or not I am capable of joining him and the Scarlet Flame Guard on their mission to ensure the joy and laughter of the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That is the kind of person I aspire to be. I want to be able to fight alongside him, with an unshakable iron will, as a member of the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Haha. I like that spark in your eyes, Nina. I expect great things from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You can count on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I will protect the joy and happiness of all those around me!</td>
