<td>Phew... Who would've thought the Jam outbreak would reach this far?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Could the Gluttony army be getting closer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Tina...you're a Wind Shaman as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes. During the Ritual of Baptism, the fountain revealed my color as emerald.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Unbelievable...so there are two of you. I see. I guess it was worth the wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Voda...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I have long awaited this day when one with the power of the wind would reemerge in the land of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ever since Alia...since the power of the wind was lost, the balance of Saga has collapsed. The Jam have emerged as a result.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The Jam continue to multiply and threaten the land of Saga. The most I can do is avoid contact with other tribes and do my best to prevent the Jam from multiplying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>How does avoiding contact with other tribes lead to preventing the Jam from multiplying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I still haven't determined the identity of the Jam. However, I know what causes it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If the purity of nature can be sustained, the Jam will cease to multiply. If it cannot be sustained, the Jam will continue to increase.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But why do the Jam keep growing then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It could be because Asena's power is waning...or...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Asena's power...?! What does that have to do with the growth of the Jam?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I cannot tell you the details, but it is largely related.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The land of Saga now faces a crisis the likes of which it has never experienced before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Thus, I have long awaited one who wields the power of the wind in order to restore balance to Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Then you'll come with us to the Fuu faction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Tina, my child...that is assuming what you speak is the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hold on! Are you trying to imply that what Tina said is a lie?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No, I'm not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>However, I must determine for myself whether Tina's resolve is worthy enough to wield the power of the wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I must also consider the possibility that a careless encounter with Fuu may cause the natural balance to collapse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm sorry if such consideration makes it appear as if I doubt your story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There they are! Over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's the Gluttony army! They're closing in on us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Voda, please, stand back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I will show you once again. I will give you proof that my resolve is real!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ah...yes...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I am one who honors the unwritten laws of nature...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>My fight is not with those who uphold peace. I ask for strength in the face of evil which threatens to bring about chaos...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Give me an ounce of courage...place a morsel in my fragile hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Aghhh! What is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>A wind bow... That reminds me of that wind fox girl from the Alize people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This is indeed the lost power of the wind! Well done...Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Please, watch me, Voda. My father entrusted me with the future of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I will not disappoint him! I will use my resolve and the power of the wind to protect the future of Saga!</td>
