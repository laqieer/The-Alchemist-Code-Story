</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>If we cooperate, we might be able to save Horeb… H-Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Her Majesty has forsaken us and now we've gotten trounced by a traitor… How much more of this can we take?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>If only His Majesty, King Arius, were here…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>…He's a Fallen, now. His kind-hearted soul has been warped into pure wrath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>There's no one left to guide us… We've been forsaken. The world has forsaken us…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's…no use. We're finished...and soon we'll be wiped out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>…When you lost King Arius, you lost your light, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>He lit your path when you were in darkness. You could always count on his guidance...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>His guidance…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You're right…what we lost was immeasurable…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>King Arius embodied our future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>As long as we followed him, we were assured survival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...We came so far because we believed in him… I believed in him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>…But he's not here anymore. He's gone…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>…I know how hard it must be…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>…Calm down, Andechs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If we don't do something, they'll...die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…They've lost hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…Hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They have no reason to keep fighting. They've lost their survival instinct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…It pains me to say it, but we don't have the luxury to defend those who've succumbed to despair…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Tch--!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The day my brother fell to corruption...all hope was already lost…</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You all are my greatest pride. I wish only for your prosperity. Therefore--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Live, young one. Leave my corpse behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>…Raise your heads!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>…Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Look here! This sword--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>…That's…the Red Blade…? I thought it was lost along with King Arius… Why do you--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The queen…entrusted this sword to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Rise up, knights! The moment you clad yourselves in armor you became the king's pride!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>His Majesty, King Arius, told me with his final breath...that we must live!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The survival of our people shall be proof of the king's victory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>His Majesty said that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Stand tall! Do that and you'll have returned the kindness he showed us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I, for one, will fight! I won't surrender!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I didn't come this far just to die…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You're right… We must--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Live… We can't surrender!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This armor my grandfather left me…I've got to do it justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Quite a moving speech…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Agreed. Things are starting to look up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…Everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I've done all that I can. What now? How…are we going to save everyone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>…We're going to put a stop to Satna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But there's no guarantee we can put a stop to this calamity. So--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>…I see. So, Nimul made the request…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You'll take us in…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Of course. That's what we're here for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Sword and shield regimens! Begin evacuation procedures and lead the Ira people to safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Based on what I've heard so far, it's likely Satna's calamity will eventually reach here…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We'll make our way down to the far reaches of the borderlands where the airship is anchored!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No dawdling! Time waits for no man! Let us prove Invidia knights shine brightest when we have something to protect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...What about you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>…I have a score to settle on that mountain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I see…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Please...take care of my people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What kind of land forces children so young to wage war…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>…I mustn't think about that now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…We must do everything we can to put an end to this nightmare.</td>
