<td>Whew, we made it outside of the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes, however...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What?! The village has been completely overrun by the Jam?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>With Sephiron gone, it was only a matter of time before we lost the village, but...now the Sephira have no home to return to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Kamui...</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yet, I must live on, as I was instructed. I must do what I can to ensure that I can manage that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>General! How is the battle going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Teona? It is good to have you back with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So Waginau is no longer with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm afraid not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Frankly, the battle is not going particularly well. Ever since those creatures—the Jam, you said?—appeared, we've been losing soldiers rapidly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Our forces simply cannot stand up to these creatures in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So, Kamui, you are a Sephira... Your people must have had some way to guard against these creatures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but with Sephiron lost, there just isn't a way to defeat such a large horde of the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ah... That is unfortunate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Then I have no choice but to call for a full retreat. Sacrifice a few so that the many may escape... That is the only path left to us if we are to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I cannot imagine that Ceclidis will simply let us go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You are not incorrect. Ceclidis is indeed a man of cruel, vengeful nature. Even if we retreat, I know he will just hunt all of us down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The only thing we can do is leave some of our people here, doomed to certain death, in order to draw his attention until the rest have escaped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We'll have to find volunteers. We're running out of time, but at least people will have the chance to say their final farewells this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Has it really come to this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
