<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Are you all right, Lady Eve?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes, I'm totally fine. I came running here, so I got the perfect warm-up as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Besides, how would you say it, I think we make an awesome team!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We-well... It definitely wasn't difficult to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Right? We're already connected even before our wedding♪ We really are a good match!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well then, this time, I think we managed to actually finish off the monster, so I think I'll get started with the cooking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>About that...I wish you won't be so careless next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Long journeys on foot and capturing monsters...they're hardly the type of things a lady like yourself should be doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If necessary, I'll go and see you. After all, fighting is a knight's duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm fine. This is nothing really. Besides, the whole distinction between ladies and knights...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Lady Eve! Please, listen to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh? O-okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm sorry for raising my voice...but I can't back down regarding this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It makes me very happy that you would put yourself at risk to come and see me, but...I do wish you would avoid making me worried in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>When it comes to my happiness from having you come to see me and my anxiety from you being in danger...the anxiety outweighs the happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Lord Fraise...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I am honestly fond of your dedication and your willingness to improve, but...that's why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Please, realize that there is someone who may be worried about you getting hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You're...right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Lady Eve, I'm sorry if I came across strongly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But, I'm glad you understand what I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes. I know exactly what you mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I didn't know you cared so much about me, Lord Fraise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Eheheh. Oh dear. Sorry. Even though I got you riled up, I feel really happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>La-Lady Eve...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't worry. I got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>After all, just the thought of you getting hurt for me, Lord Fraise...it scares me a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh...ah, yeah. That's what I wanted to convey to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I feel so happy. Thank you, Lord Fraise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Um...not at all. Thank you...for caring about me so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That being said, I didn't think speaking to you sternly would make you so happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Eheheh. Well then, you're hungry, aren't you? Hold on a little. I'm gonna work extra hard to make something nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>N-no, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ahaha. See, you are hungry. I'll borrow your kitchen. It'll be ready right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No, it's fine♪ Oh, by the way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'll try to be more careful so that you won't have to worry in the future, Lord Fraise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But also...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm going to become even stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm going to blow away all the danger that comes your way♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Meanwhile, I would be very happy if you would protect me♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Lady Eve...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Whoa! So-sorry! I think my stomach is at its limit...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Heheh. Got it. Let's have lunch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yes! Leave it to me! I've been practicing a loooot for you, Lord Fraise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Alrighty! I'm gonna do my best♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Oops...I need to be careful not to overdo it so I don't injure myself♪</td>
