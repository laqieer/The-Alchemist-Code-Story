<td>We did it, Birgitta! We got them to leave!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It was a pretty forceful method, but...it worked, I suppose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, we should probably settle on a tree quickly. The sun is setting after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's right. Let's pick a tree! The biggest one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'll also look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Me too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>"I'll go with you!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>They're all gigantic trees, just look at 'em all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ravina? Is Winter Holiday not fun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmm... I mean, everyone seems to be having fun, I'm not saying Winter Holiday isn't fun, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Everyone is having a great time. When I was younger there never were events as fun as this. I'm kinda jealous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Really!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Apparently, Winter Holiday comes from another world. Some people brought it here to "bring smiles to the children."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wow, you know so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Heh. I've been doing some background reading so I can be ready for this Winter Holiday duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>One person wanted to share this joy around the world and has made so many people happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>All who cherishes this wonderful event are good kids!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...I also think so. Michael, as well as Lofia, they're doing their best for the sake of Winter Holiday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You are as well, Ravina, right? You yourself said you wanted to help out with the festivities, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...but, that's only because I thought I could be with Michael and Lofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>They always have to work this time of the year, that's why I thought that if I also worked on Winter Holiday, I could be with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I requested to do security alongside them...but they wouldn't let me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Is that so? Well, me too, Ravina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I also requested to work security on Winter Holiday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Really?! Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, Winter Holiday is when all the cake shops put out their best cakes, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Lofia said there's always a ton of sweet cakes on Winter Holiday. So I thought, I definitely gotta get in on that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>There are also cakes that aren't found in Gluttony Foss, I need me some of those cakes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I thought there'd be a chance to eat those yummy cakes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...but, but while I was looking into it, I realized something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Realized what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well...if you don't reserve a cake ahead of time, you can't get one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ah, yeah, I suppose that's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I thought to myself, "How awful, how terrible! I won't be able to eat Winter Holiday cake! Even though it's Winter Holiday!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But, then I thought, the decorations around town are really exciting, and preparing for the party with you and everyone else was really REALLY fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Winter Holiday, a day when we work to make others smile, how wonderful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Even if there is no cake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Even if there is no cake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Of course, it would be even better with cake! That goes without saying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But that's fine. It's okay to say we're lonely. It's okay to say we crave cake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...I guess so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wanting to eat cake, loving the Winter Holiday... I really feel those things!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(But I feel lonely when Michael and Lofia are not around)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(So I thought I wouldn't enjoy the Winter Holiday. But...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...I see now. It's okay to feel both.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...Thank you, Lotiyah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>This tree is the biggest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Great. Ravina and everyone are here already. I lost...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It's not about winning or losing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(I really just stumbled upon this spot...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Everyone found the tree together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I lost...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Heh, but don't you think it's great we found a tree we can all agree on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Yes! Very true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>So, let's take this tree and decorate it with Michael and Lofia in mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Then it'll be the most wonderful tree ever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Okay, let's ask the Maruda tribe if they will carry it back for us while we go home first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Phew, we are finally home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The Maruda tribe said they would deliver it to the party by sled for us, so that's settled...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hm? What happened to Klima and the rest of them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hehe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I... I think I'll just stick with what I'm wearing now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Nope! This is a Winter Holiday party! Dress like it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Ooh! I'm good at this! Perfect! You look so cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Wow, Ravina, you look great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Y-you think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Of course! You look so festive, Michael and Lofia are sure to be thrilled!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Mhmm. For sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Amazing! The town is all glittery, like the starry night sky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You were in the Maruda tribe village, Nina, so you didn't see it happening, but Ravina did all of this. Look, and over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Hey you two! Don't run! Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Oh, no, it's not that big of a deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What are you saying?! This is positively wonderful! It's as if the entire town is celebrating Winter Holiday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>The town, the people, everything is in the Winter Holiday spirit! And it's all thanks to Ravina. Look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Mommy, look! The decorations are so pretty! Winter Holiday is so much fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Don't run! If you don't behave, Santa won't bring you a present!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>What, no! I'll behave!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Well, we better do our shopping and get home quickly then, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>This year's decorations are so cute! Everything sparkles!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Only someone who truly loves Winter Holiday could decorate like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Everyone loves your decorations, Ravina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>You will certainly get your wish from Santa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>That would be nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Although, first we need to complete that tree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Even so, where did those two go? I thought they would be back by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Shall we go look for them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Hm? You guys...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Hey! Good timing! Didn't you guys see Santa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>There's been a report of a sighting nearby. We'll catch him this year!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Huh? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Those two... Those two are trying to catch Santa and expose him...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>They can't just go causing trouble for Santa like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Hmm, have you two actually finished all of your work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>"Bringing presents to unfortunate children everywhere," isn't this your task?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Hm? We were doing our work! But, something more important came along, so we put it on hold...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>That's right! It's our dream to catch Santa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>So, you're saying you haven't finished your work...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>We'll finish everything once we've caught Santa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Santa isn't some thing you can go and catch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>By the way, what was that about sightings being reported?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Oh yeah! Someone had a composite sketch drawn. The person looks like this, apparently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Th-this is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>This person kind of looks like...Michael.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>That's what I thought too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Which reminds me, we mistook Michael for Santa before and attacked him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Seems so! He looks just like Santa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Causing trouble for Michael... I won't allow that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>R-Ravina?! Calm down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>That person just now... He kind of looks like the sketch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>True! Red hat, white beard, glasses!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Which means... THAT's Santa! We gotta catch him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Oy... You don't want to stop Santa Claus doing his work, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Huh? Who are you guys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I don't know, but they don't look like one of Santa's pals, do they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>It's time for us to make some money. And I'm not gonna let you get in my way.</td>
