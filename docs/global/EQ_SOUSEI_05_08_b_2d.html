<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>But this should be enough...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ready! Valley of Siddim activated!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Grrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Grrroooooaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's...gathering magil?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Nimul, this thing is planning something bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I know, I know. But what—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This devastating amount of magil... Could it be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Everyone hold on tight! We've got a big wave coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sorry, little miss. Gotta be a bit rough here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh? Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Don't move! We've got to stay down and ride this out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>"I am Transcender of the Gate of Gluttony!" Wind, grant us protection!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Raaaaaaaaaaargghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ngh! This is just like that time it protected itself against Sagittarius!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Is everybody okay? Everyone still alive?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Adaleigh, what do things look like from up there—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Eyes in front! The thing's headed right for the fleet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Nnrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(I expended too much alchemy defending us just now... I barely have enough strength to cast anything else...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Grrooooooooooooarrrrrrrrrgghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Bwirruru!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Was that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh, thank goodness, I made it right on time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You're...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Nicaea?! What are you doing on the front line?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I had a feeling Leviathan was coming, so I rushed on over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>How's Daphne? Oh no, she's been wounded...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Very well, I suppose I'll have to take matters into my own hands then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What? You're kidding me! You stop that right now, Nicaea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>A lady shouldn't be out here! This a job for the Purple Flame Knights!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>My apologies, Imnus, but I fear this is very much my duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Wait, Nicaea—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Princess, are you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The Invidia Belt possesses two great treasures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The first is the Silver Shield, which repels evil and keeps us safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>And then there's our last resort, which is supposed to protect us at a time when the shield cannot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The people of my ancient bloodline have ruled the Invidia Belt for generations. All of them did whatever they could for their people, passing it down from generation to generation... All for this moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh Selsieg, sacred beast of burgeoning time, the time has come for you to lend me your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Bwrii bwriii!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This will be a little difficult, but...we'll do our best, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Bwripz!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>"In an age long past, on the day that this corrupted ocean gave birth to calamity, the sacred beast led us to safe havens..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>"We ask you once more to grant us peace..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Bwripz!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Grrrraaaarrrrgggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Brriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>That thing has the same magil signature as the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg? Such a thing was right under our nose this whole time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Selsieg carries the blood of a dragon that once lived in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That's why it has the power to manipulate the sea, just like the Leviathan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But it's lost the form and knowledge it once possessed. That's why it can't wield its power without someone of the royal family to aid it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Regardless, it has enough power to hold back the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>A dragon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Imnus, now's your chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Right, my apologies. Everyone, continue to retreat! We don't have the time to dawdle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Our princess is putting her life on the line to save us! Don't sully the name of the knights by putting that to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yes, sir! Everyone get a move on! We need to get home alive and well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Bz...rep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>We got to hold on just...a little longer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Brrii!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>We made it out of there somehow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Imnus, is Nicaea all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>She just fainted. Synchronizing with the sacred beast comes at a cost, even for someone like her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...What was she thinking? Using it to scare away the Cursed Beast... Completely reckless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Imnus...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>My apologies. This is not the time for sentimentality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>We've got to rally the troops and think of what to do with the Ira Belt knights we rescued.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast appeared much too close to our shores and now there is now a significant amount of damage to deal with in town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...And I fear that this isn't the last we've seen from the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'm afraid I gotta agree with you there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>We got our backs up against the wall over in the Ira Belt, they've got no other way out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Beat 'em once or twice, they're not going to give up anytime soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...Where...am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Oh, hello. Welcome back, little lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Is this capital? Ah, the battle! What happened?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Lady Nicaea did what?! Why would she—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Leviathan showed up in the middle of the battle, so she came to stop it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Wh-why... I-I am the one responsible for keeping everyone safe from the Cursed Beast...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>That's right... I... I shattered the shield...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>So that means...that I'm useless now...? After all the encouragement everybody gave me, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Do not lose heart, my knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Your Highness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Nicaea carried out her royal duty. As king, I must do the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>The Leviathan has continued to inflict more and more damage ever since the day our borders clashed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>It's clear to me that we will only face greater calamity if I continue to look on from the sidelines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>That's why I am ordering you to kill Leviathan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You want us to kill a Cursed Beast?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I understand your shock. Cursed Beasts are a force of nature after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>But if we wish to survive, we have no choice but to oppose nature's laws! Prepare yourself, my dearest knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>From here on out, we shall carve our own future with our own hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Yes, Your Highness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Your Highness, that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I know what you're thinking, but time is not on our side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>What difference does it make to face destruction at our own hands or the fangs of a Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I will choose the path that will allow my citizens to know peace for as long as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>...Even if that will call down greater calamity on us further down the line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I'm asking you to understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...I may be young, but I also inherited a responsibility to lead my people. I understand your feelings all too well. Painfully well even.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>(The people here in the region are just doing their best to survive, same as us.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>(If we want to protect them from sorrow, then there's only one thing to do.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I understand. We will do everything in our power to help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You have our utmost gratitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>...The die have been cast. The gods are no longer the ones that control our fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>We have to stand up, for our own beliefs, our own pride.</td>
</tr>
