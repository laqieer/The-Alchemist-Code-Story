<td>Here. Stand up!</td>

<td>Ack...</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>A healthy spirit resides within a healthy body! Next time you try and pick a fight make sure you've trained for it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well then...looks like the sun's already set. Oh, wow! The stars are brighter than usual tonight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You're right...how beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...Ah! You're finally smiling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, I was getting worried since you looked so pained all this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Eve...</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hey, what is that star that's shining the brightest? It's really beautiful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, when that star is visible, it means that the weather will be fair tomorrow! It'll be the perfect day to hang your laundry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Is that a fortune as well? It seems oddly practical.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heheh. This is simply an observation I made by evaluating the sky. It's not fortune-telling. Still, not just astrology, but fortune-telling in general can be quite practical.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The stars, which have seen everlasting history, are now showing us the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Fortune-telling is all about reading them statistically and simply using them as guidance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Just like you said, Eve, we must ultimately pave our own destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wow... You really like the stars, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. I love them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I see! I'm not really interested in fortune-telling, but I do like gazing at beautiful starry skies. One day, I'd like to find a nice husband to do it with...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>All right! From tomorrow, I'm gonna do my best to find one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Heheh. You have my full support.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(Yes. The first time I looked up at the starry sky, I couldn't take my eyes off of its dazzling beauty.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(That was my beginning as an astrologer. I truly believe that this love I have for the stars is what matters the most.)</td>
