<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Now we will announce the knight who handled themselves best during the mock battle. The winner is...Bertha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Th-thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I hope that you will continue to wield your powers to the fullest of your ability in the name of our beloved Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Th-the best...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Didn't I tell you? It's only natural. You had my brains behind you, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>When I was watching you during the performance, I realized that the reason you were making all of those superfluous movements was because you were trying to take on too much alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>S-superfluous...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Your role is not to work alone; no one expects that of you. Besides, gunners aren't supposed to fight without aid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If you take on so much that you render yourself over-encumbered, then frankly you ought not to be on the battlefield. Pawns are only useful when they can be moved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(I get the feeling that this kid probably is as good as he says...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(Still, the way he's talking to me makes it hard to accept what he has to say.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Now... Do you understand who I am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh? Who you are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well... You're very smart. That much is obvious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Smart?! I'd appreciate it if you could avoid using such primitive vocabulary to describe me. I am nothing less than a genius!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm pretty sure you're younger than me... Even so, you're pretty talented! It's impressive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Now you listen to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You are the impressive one here. Your movements were exceptional despite the cannon's size in relation to your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes, you moved very well, even though you are so small...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You're not that much taller than me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So, you're interested in cannons, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Why would you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I mean, you're kinda staring at them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I am not...not interested in them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Jeez. Couldn't you have just said yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, I know! Why don't you have a closer look?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I know! I'll go and get the cannon I used for the performance earlier. Can't really show you the ones we used for the mock battle, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>H-hold on one moment! May I...really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I mean, you seem like a big fan of cannons. Your eyes go all shiny when you look at them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So! We should head over there. You see? It's a nice open space, perfect for firing cannons. Sometimes I practice there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It is...rather far from the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So what? Don't you wanna get up close and personal with a cannon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Well, I wouldn't quite phrase it like that, but for argument's sake...yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Then it's settled! I'm just going to go and get the cannon, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>My, my... Despite her being considerably cautious earlier, she really is far too trusting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Here we are! This is the cannon I used during my performance. Like you said, it's a little too big for me, but it's so loud! Just you wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Y-you really brought it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I... Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So this is how it... I see... The gunpowder... Hmm... Interesting...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Y-you know, the way you keep staring could make a cannon blush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ahh... Cannons really are among the coolest weapons. Yes... If I only had a talent for the military, then perhaps even I could...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hm? Oh, nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You know, I had always thought that Slothstein was the country for artillery, but I daresay that Envylia could give it a run for its money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Heheh! Not bad, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It might be a little...old-fashioned...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>But you really are a capable gunner. That much I cannot deny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>R-really?! You really think so?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The speed with which you calculate the trajectory of your shot and the precision with which you fire... Just one of those skills would make you a knight of the highest caliber, yet you possess them both in spite of your small stature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ugh! I am so sick of you bringing up my height!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Anyway, it's nice to hear you say all of that, but I think I still have a long way to go. I'm still not nearly good enough yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Not good enough? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I want to protect as many people as I possibly can. To do that, I've got to keep improving my skills as a gunner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>So I need to keep working hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Did my words of but a few moments ago fail to convince you of how skilled you are? Your speed, your precision? Did that mean nothing? Are you not taking me seriously?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Or perhaps... Yes. I think you have difficulty recognizing your true worth⁠.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I...um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Fancy meeting you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>So you're Chao, huh? You're coming with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Wh-what's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Bertha, you should leave now. Return to your post. I shall deal with this...conundrum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>N-no! Wait! Chao!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>(I'd certainly prefer to avoid causing a scene in Envylia. However...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>(I let Bertha lead me out here; I allowed myself to be vulnerable. I cannot allow my negligence to involve her in anything unsavory.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Look at you, prancing around the continent for your studies. Luckily for me, that's given me the chance I needed to get to you. The opportunity of a lifetime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Prancing? How dare you! I am learning what is necessary for me to become a masterful strategist!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Well, it's not really in my interests that you succeed in your promising career. I've got a bone to pick with your family, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Now, we can do this the easy way or the hard way, but either way you're coming with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Ready... Fire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Aaaaarrghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Chao! Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Bertha! What are you doing?! I told you that I would deal with this—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You really thought I'd listen to that?! I couldn't just leave you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I use my cannon to protect my friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I-I warned you! Hmph... You're awfully stubborn for your size, squirt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Squirt?! Was that really necessary?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Heh. Hiding behind little girls now, are we? I hope you don't think a single gunner is going to do you much good, Chao.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Bertha. I need you to do exactly as I say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>You see? That's how we can compensate for the lack in firepower. With my strategy behind you, there's no way you're going to lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Well, that's reassuring!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>It's thanks to you that I came out first in the mock battle, after all!</td>
</tr>
