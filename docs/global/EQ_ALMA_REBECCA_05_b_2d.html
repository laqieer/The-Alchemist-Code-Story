<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Well? Did you talk to Eleonora?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I did. I was able to learn some very interesting and important things from her, although it had to wait a few days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why did Matthew become the janitor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes. I thought it was a bit odd. If you're going to run the school together as a married couple, shouldn't he be in management instead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Right man...for the job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He was the one who turned it down, saying, "Why would I manage a magic school when I can't use magic?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But isn't being a janitor a bit rough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I've got stamina...and I don't get sick easily. I'm best. For the job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We compromise and do the things we're best suited for. That way, we have mutual respect and can raise each other up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I think that is definitely the secret to our happy marriage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's truly beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Magic has always been at the heart of this country...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But there are things witches are good at and things that men are good at.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I believe now that the key to compromise between men and women is mutual respect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So men could be educated on things other than magic, such as incantations and architecture...and other important skills needed for work. I believe that we need a school like this where they can be cared for and nurtured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A school for men? Then you intend to separate the men and women?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No, my intention is for the two schools to someday integrate so that our people may be educated together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Co-education? Won't that simply bring back competition between the sexes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Competition itself is not a bad thing. In reality, the feelings of not wanting to lose can become wonderful motivation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What is important is to create an environment where men and women can bring out the best in each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Going forward, I'm sure that we will see witches who are more interested in incantations and physical labor, and men who are interested in magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>There, they will be able to find rivals that will set their hearts on fire. That simmering heat is just what this country needs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>By sharing the load, working together, and even clashing swords sometimes, everyone can come to show each other the respect that is needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We have to do away with this archaic concept of stereotyping what men and women are suited for, and move on together into a world where everyone can help each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's what I believe the new regime needs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What...do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's not bad, but to start a school and teach incantations, you need qualified staff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I have someone in mind! After this, I've got plans to discuss terms with him over lunch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I will definitely get him to agree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Do as you will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Th-thank you! I'm off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>A school, huh? Seems like she's started thinking like you now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What are you talking about, Melvy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>How I remember it, you had pretty similar ideals when you made this school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hm... It has been a century. You cannot expect me to remember such matters of little import.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Little early to be going senile, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Quite the opposite. From now on, I suppose I will be taking on more of a supervisory role.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Could be. At last, we can look forward to the rise of a new queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(Liz... This would have been impossible for the person I was before. From now on, I'll do my best to learn how to better understand people.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(Feeling other's pain as if it is your own is your specialty...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(But when I learn how to do that, I know I can become a queen who fights not only for herself, but for everyone else as well.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Next time...I won't lose to you, Liz!</td>
</tr>
