<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>We made it to shore, baby! Though I guess we've gotta dock the ship first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That won't be a problem. Due to the current situation, most of the ships are absent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>All that said, it really is incredible that this heavy metal ship can take to the skies... You'd never guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Indeed, I was plenty surprised myself when I saw it for the first time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You are...Emmel, correct? Your crew is unexpectedly...diverse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's true, we've gathered under rather complex circumstances...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm sorry, my brother would be better at explaining all of this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Don't worry about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Now that you mention it, wasn't Nimul off to see the king of these parts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Indeed, Princess Nicaea invited him to meet her father, the king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm sure that King Patricius will be eager to hear your story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I still can't believe that the princess was on the ship we rescued. Talk about lucky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If you call encountering a Cursed Beast the second we arrive 'lucky'. Speaking of which...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast of this area, Leviathan, right? What kind of Beast is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What kind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You looked like you were in pretty dire straits back there, but for whatever reason, it didn't look like you were giving up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So I thought it looked like you might've had a way of dealing with the problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. Well, there is one thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The Silver Shield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>270</td>
<td>The Silver Shield is one of the Invidia Belt's greatest treasures. As long as we have this shield, the Cursed Beasts can't harm us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>At least, that's what everybody believes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm not... I'm not worthy of carrying something so important...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh? Looks like that knight has her own troubles. How young and innocent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Doubt, confusion, hesitation, anxiety... There's no harm in worrying once in a while, though I fear the young lady might be taking it a bit too far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I wouldn't mind giving her a little pep talk, but I'm not sure how I should go about initiating something like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Good work keeping the supplies safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...Why are you standing around in a place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If you could show me your permit, then I could lead you to your designated warehouse—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oops, don't you worry about that. I'm on the job. See ya around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Sigh... This country. The people are friendly and the location is great. If only people weren't so nosy it'd be perfect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Well then, back to work...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's about time I paid my respects to the king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>All right, let me see. You were Nimul—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You're Yna and this is Eulalia. Hehe, did I get them right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Then there was Emmel, Adaleigh, Mira and Nyx too, but we left them on the ship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You didn't have to leave them behind, you know. I would've been more than happy to invite all of you in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We're already asking a lot of you, we couldn't possibly ask for more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that the princess herself would show us around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Haha, of course I would! You saved my life out there, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>If I made some subordinate lead you around in my stead, why, I'd bring shame on the entire royal family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>More importantly, tell me more about what you did out there! That arrow of light was breathtaking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I've never seen a light so gorgeous in all my years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You mean Sagittarius? It's one of the Gears of Judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh my! To think that other places possess treasures such as the Silver Shield, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Is that the shield your knight was carrying earlier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Indeed, it is one of our greatest treasures. The Silver Shield, that which keeps the Leviathan's corruption at bay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Keeps the corruption at bay... I see, so you've been able to fend off the Cursed Beast with that shield?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Well, we've kept it from getting too close at least. But this generation's shield maiden, Daphne, I believe she'll be different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You can scour the annals of history, but there has not been a single knight as beloved by the Silver Shield as her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...If only she had a little more self-confidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Lady Nicaea—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ah, we're here. My father, King Patricius, will be waiting behind the door.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Please, go on in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yes, thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Why, how unexpected. Visitors from another region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It's an honor to make your acquaintance, Your Highness. I am Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>We've come from the distant Gula Belt to request an audience with you, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>There's no need for the formalities. You saved my daughters life, so please consider yourselves guests of honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I will grant you hospitality befitting a king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Tell me what I can do for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I heard that you had some questions about our lands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>As a token of my gratitude, I'll tell you whatever is within my power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Thank you for your kindness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Allow me to explain. We came here to investigate a certain matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Oh? An investigation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Indeed, we've travelled across many lands, and on our journey we crossed paths with a certain organization more than once. They call themselves the Infinite Serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>We believe that they are planning to use the Cursed Beasts for one reason or another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Imnus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Forgive me, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>(I knew it, they must've dealt with them before. But what was that reaction just now?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>The Infinite Serpent, I see... Tell me, what do you plan to do if you learn of their plans and whereabouts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Most likely? Stop them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>We know that they give aid and relief to the people of this world, much like we ourselves are trying to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>But their methods involve great sacrifice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>And that isn't something we can overlook.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...It sounds like you intend to change this world. Am I right in assuming so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Yes. Our dream is to cleanse this world of all sin and release every region from the bonds of corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>We will do whatever we must to achieve that goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Then is it true you possess a weapon that can fight the Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Yes, we call it the Gear of Judgement. It's a weapon that can strip sinful magil from a Cursed Beast. This renders it vulnerable to destruction through human means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Then I am left wondering why you chased away Leviathan instead of killing it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>We... We used to think that the only way to restore peace to this world was through the destruction of all Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...Allow me to guess: that's when the sky cracked?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Yes, but we aren't certain if the two are connected yet. It might be because of the death of the Cursed Beast, it might be another cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Regardless, it appears that the Infinite Serpent knows what's really going on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>We have reason to believe these serpents have already made their way into the Invidia Belt. Are we wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>So that's what you're investigating...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I understand. Then I suppose we could speak to each other as allies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Your Highness! It's much too soon to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Too soon? I fear this situation does not permit us the time to hesitate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Could you tell me a little more about your situation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Of course. It is only fair that I do some talking in exchange for all the information you have shared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Our people live in harmony with the water. We are a people who have carved out a way to live upon this ocean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>There is but a narrow sea route that connects our limited land to the rest of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>We've fought with all our strength to protect this connection. Somehow we've managed to fend off the Leviathan until now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>A month ago, something unusual happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Have you heard of the Ira Belt? It's a place of scorched earth and blistering winds, a terrible and barren place, much unlike our lands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>But all of the sudden half of our borders touched this very Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>How could two Belt Regions become connected in such a way? It's abnormal, simply unheard of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>But this unthinkable event really did happen, and this sudden change roused the Cursed Beasts that live in both our kingdoms. Ever since then, they've grown wild.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>You're dealing with two Cursed Beasts?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Of course, since every region has its own Cursed Beast inhabiting it. However, it was this strange situation that triggered our current calamity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>...To make matters worse, we're also dealing with the people of the Ira Belt attacking us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>You see, they placed all the blame regarding the Cursed Beasts on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>A false accusation then... The Cursed Beasts are a force of nature. Regular humans can't understand or manipulate them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Nevertheless, we live in very different environments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>They do not have the ships to cross our oceans, and we do not have the equipment to withstand their scorching heat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>So aside from some skirmishes at the border, we've been able to avoid any all-out war. Until now, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>One of our spies contacted me the other day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>It seems that they've started constructing ships in the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Without the years of experience needed to craft vessels? Smells fishy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Indeed. It seems like some strangers arrived to offer them the knowledge they lacked. A group called—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>The Infinite Serpent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Exactly. In other words, we share an enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>We will do everything in our power to help you with your investigation, but we'd like something in return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>You called the Cursed Beasts a force of nature before, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Yes, what about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I have the suspicion that means you know something about how to subdue such a force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Are you asking us to fight on your side in this conflict?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>These so-called serpents you are chasing are aiding those in Ira Belt Region. It's reasonable to believe you may find them on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>So wouldn't joining our fight be a good way to catch your snakes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>You can refuse us, of course. But our only goal is preserving the peace of these lands. We do not wish to see the fires of war stoked any higher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>There is not such a great power difference between us and Ire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>With only our own strength, a war would drag on for a long time before it reached a conclusion, and at the end we would be left with little more than pieces of what we once were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I get it, I get it. We both wish for peace. Our goal is also to attain peace for all these lands, so we'd normally be hesitant to engage in war, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>We shall help this time. We will find a way to stop this conflict from boiling over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Wonderful, then we're allies. Imnus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Yes, Your Highness! Please allow me to guide you around the castle. This way, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Peace between all the kingdoms, hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Well, facing the Cursed Beasts is a good thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>As is searching for the truth of this world, but I can't help but wonder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Is our Nimul aware that there is only one way to maintain peace across all these lands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>The only path to peace is to subjugate and rule over all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Looks like I walked in on some pretty menacing self-contemplation here. Talk about bad timing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Oh? You managed to sneak your way into the throne room? Well, I did expect that this would happen sooner or later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>So tell me, what business does a secret agent from the Ira Belt have with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Oof, you really saw straight through me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>I guess there's no reason to keep up this disguise then. My name is Andechs, from the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>I've been entrusted King Arius' wish to preserve peace between our kingdoms—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Well, I'm basically your everyday righteous knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Your lodgings will be ready soon. Please call if there is anything you need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>I am also the commander in charge of the war against the Ira Belt, so you can direct any questions regarding our strategy my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Oh my, your audience with my father is already finished? If you'd like a tour of the castle, then please allow me—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>It'd be better if you left, Nicaea. We're discussing the war, a topic unsuitable for a noble lady such as yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>How rude! These men saved my life. I merely wish to show my gratitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Besides, shouldn't you be a little happier I made it back alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>I... Of course, I... That has nothing to do with this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>They seem very close, don't you think? Perhaps even...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Oh, my apologies, I forgot to introduce him properly. This is Imnus, Captain of the Purple Flame Knights, and my fiancé.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>...Did you need to tell them that last part?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>That's an important part! A very, VERY important part!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>...Is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Please don't involve us in your lovers' quarrel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Julia! Stop this! If we fight, it'll just end up hurting Emmel—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Only Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Nimul, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Even though it was me who always loved you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>What are you doing?! You're not the kind of man who will let a little difficulty stop you, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>I don't think so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Julia, is that you? You're still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>You're going to save the world, right? This is the best chance you're going to get!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Strangely, I feel like this kind of thing has been haunting me recently...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Poor Nimul. No one else is ever going to get that worked up about him ever again, probably. You should just give up on love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Huh? Seriously?! What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>My apologies, we're making you listen to our nonsensical chatter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>No, it's all right. This is actually a good opportunity for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>After all, we'll be fighting alongside one another, even if it's just temporarily. How about we eat something and talk after?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Then I'll prepare some tea and refreshments right away. I'd love to hear more about the outside world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>...Make sure you behave, will you, Nicaea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Of course, no need to worry about me. I'll get everything ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Then I'll help. We should invite Mira and Emmel too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Wonderful! The more the merrier! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>...And just like that, the girls are off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>No time to get a word in edgeways when they're excited like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>It's been a long time since Nicaea had the chance to receive visitors, so I understand where the enthusiasm comes from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Ever since the Ira Belt's invasion, we've had nothing but bad news...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>I know it may be troublesome, but I'd like you to get along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Oh no, it's no problem at all... Erm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>...Why are you looking at me like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>You're surprisingly understanding of others. I think I'm finally getting a grasp of the kind of guy you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>...I'm the Captain of the Purple Flame Knights. I rally my knights to protect this kingdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>At least, that's what I try to do. I didn't think I was showing you weakness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>No, I didn't mean to say you look weak. I meant that you come across as a man who fights for the sake of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>...This is a very peaceful place. Even when we're being terrorized by this Cursed Beast, the citizens get to spend their days smiling and laughing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>That's why I... Why I want to protect that peace. So that Nicaea can spend her days in happiness and laughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>It might be selfish, but please lend us your help so I can ensure things can stay that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Uhm, Daphne, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Ah, y-yes! How can I help you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>You just looked like you were worried about something. I know we just met, but I'm happy to listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Oh no, me? I... I'm not worried about a thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>Hn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>I heard that you were planning to fight the Cursed Beasts. Is that true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Yeah, we are. Though truth be told, I'm usually just watching from the sidelines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>My brother and the rest are the ones who do all the fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>You're still amazing. I don't think I could wear a smile knowing I was about to face the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>Daphne, are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>I saw it, you know... That day, when our lands suddenly touched the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>They were fighting... Right on the border where these oceans where I grew up met those scorched lands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>GRRRRRROOAR!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>Two giants on a rampage, engulfing whatever stood in their path of destruction... I don't think I could ever forget the sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>You were that close when it happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>Ever since that day, I've feared Leviathan. I've seen what it can do, the destruction it wreaks. If that thing were to notice me—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>My hands start shaking at the thought...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Daphne...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>A-ah! I'm sorry! Someone who vowed to protect her citizens shouldn't say such things...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>I don't think so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Huh? What are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>I think you've got it all wrong. It's fine to be scared of the Cursed Beasts. All of us are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>It's just—we have to fight. We must fight. It's the only choice we've got.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>The only choice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>We want to protect people. To rescue and save them. Above all, we don't want this world to be stolen from us. It might be scary, but we must face it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>So I don't think there's anything wrong with you. Scared or not, you stood up and faced the Leviathan to protect your ship back there, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>I-it'll be fine... I've just got to believe... It'll be just like in practice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>(The only way to change our fates is by borrowing the power of the Silver Shield... So I can't fail here!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>"People of Invidia, lend me your strength!" P-please!</td>
</tr>
