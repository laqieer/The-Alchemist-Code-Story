<td>Tsk! They're a tenacious bunch, aren't they!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Aye, these Alkaroid's are the AJ1000 model!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No need to explain. Fighting them tells me everything I need to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That being said, with all the security measure they've placed on this compartment...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>There's no doubt that's where Ethan is being held!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yep. I'm certain as well.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Jeez. I don't want to admit it, but the Beckrams use incredible technology. It's amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But...there is no soul there.</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If you compare Alkemono with those androids the difference is obvious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Of course! Androids should live in harmony and assist mankind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The Beckrams' philosophy is completely different than ours. We believe that people's lifestyles should be the priority!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Unlike the Beckrams, who believe in prioritizing profit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>For the Beckrams, androids are nothing more than toolsâ€”products.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>They believe there is no soul within them. After all, a soul is something they've never sought from their creations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>They believe a machine has no need of a soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But I think that's a very dangerous way of thinking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>How can people believe that, as long as it's a machine, it can be treated horribly and abused for the purpose of self-gain?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That way of thinking will eventually rob us of our humanity!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I feel like once this idea penetrates society, people will begin to forget who they are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's crucial that those who deal with machines must have the correct mindset and philosophy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The Beckrams way of thinking will never bring about true abundance to this country!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Heh. If your old man could see you now. He'd be crying tears of joy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh! So-sorry...I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You don't have to apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Jeez. Thanks to your strong determination, it's given me a newfound will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Aye, you moved us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The Sacred Stone Belphegor really should belong to you, little lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We've no time to waste here. Hold on tight!</td>
