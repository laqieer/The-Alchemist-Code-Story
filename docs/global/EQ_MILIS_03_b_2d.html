<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I-I thought we were gonna die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm not sure I would've survived on my own. Thank you, Milis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The feeling is mutual! But why was that black thing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Most likely, it was here to protect the relic that had been placed here—the one on top of the altar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Is this a book?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It looks like it. Let's see its contents—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What's the matter, Lofy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No. It's nothing. It seems like this book is something extremely important to Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Really?! That's good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Thanks, Milis. You saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Eheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Come on. Let's return to Lustburg. We need to report about these ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Also, I'm sure the knights scattered here would like to return home as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This concludes my report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well, well. I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I've heard your report, Court Mage Lofia. We will investigate this case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Putting that aside, we must give you a reward that is appropriate for the work you've accomplished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What? We're gonna get paid?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Of course. The country cannot make advancements if we do not reward fine work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We did it, Lofy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...Lofy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Is there a problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hoho! Not in the least! I see, I see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Court Mage Lofia, do cherish your friends. They are a treasure of a lifetime!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Lofy, why is your face red?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's nothing. More importantly, the promise we made...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh? Did we make a promise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>About eating together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh, that's right! Now that we've got pocket money let's go crazy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wow. There are still so many sweets I don't know about! Hey, Lofy, what do you want to eat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>More importantly, what's in this plate? Why is it in front of me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huh? I promised you, didn't I? That water lizard cuisine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This is food? I heard there was a dish called Otsukuri in Wadatsumi, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Otsu...kuri? Never heard of food like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>There's so much that I don't know about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You can learn little by little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>By the way, what are you doing in Lustburg, Milis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, well, my grandma sent me on an errand and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I-I completely forgot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hey, Lofy! Is there something called Venus School of Magic around here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Calm down, Milis! You're spilling cream!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Is that really all your errands? Have you forgotten something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No, that's everything! It's all thanks to you being acquainted with the high-ups here in Lustburg, Lofy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I've never heard of someone forgetting the reason why they came to this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>W-well, I was so hungry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Eheh. I ended up relying on you until the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I gotta go home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Are you sad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I didn't say that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I am. I can't believe that I have to say goodbye to you here, Lofy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>So this is goodbye. Yes. I'm sure this will be the last time we meet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'll come again to this city!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>When I do, let's eat sweets together again, okay? Next time I'll tell you all about my homeland!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Oh, that's right! You also need to teach me to become a gentlewoman like you, Lofy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>There's so much we've gotta do together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'm looking forward to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>If that were actually possible, it would make me happy as well. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yes. I'm looking forward to it too! I'll see you then! I promise—promise!—to come and see you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>If you have any problems, just tell me! I'll always take your side, Lofy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>See you soon, Lofy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>See yaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Bye bye, Milis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>But I can't meet you again. I can't afford to let you get involved any further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That all seems like a distant memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>It's been a while since I've come to eat that special chiffon cake from that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I wonder if Milis came to see me today as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I gave Michael the nasty job of turning her away every time she came.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I wish I could see her at least one last time. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>But I can't let her get involved any further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I can't tell anyone about the information written within the book recovered from the ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I can't believe that the Sacred Stone Asmodeus contained such a secret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>If I don't protect it, this country will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...Oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You're Court Mage Lofia, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>A Paladin? Here in the center of the city?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>To accomplish our aim, we can't allow you to remain alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>That means your aim is to...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You've uncovered too much. I'm going to silence you. Forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Huh?! Oh, blood! Eeek! Someone help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>O-ohh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Ahaha. I doubt I'm surviving this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I was planning on visiting sweet shops across the city today. I guess not being able to do that is my only regret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Now that the other side has made such a bold move, the Court Mage Order will be on guard as well. That means the country will be okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>The promise we made..that's my other regret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Yes. I'm looking forward to it too! I'll see you then! I promise—promise!—to come and see you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>If you have any problems, just tell me! I'll always take your side, Lofy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>It doesn't look like I can keep my promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Milis.</td>
</tr>
