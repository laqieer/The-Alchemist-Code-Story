<td>So you knew all this time. What else are you hiding?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Seeing that you won't be leaving alive, I suppose I could tell you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The attack on the facility your sister was receiving treatment at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It was an inside job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Why would you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Suffice to say, they decided their best interests lay elsewhere. Outside of my jurisdiction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We can't have that now, can we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Not when Eira is useful to us. To Goetia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Then what about Soren? What do you want with him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ah, I'm sure Emrys can tell you all about that cruel, cruel man, and what he did to poor Eira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It would be a shame to let all that research go to waste...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Where did you take my sister, fiend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Now that is truly none of your business. Just know that she's in good hands...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Better than yours, at any rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Whatâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(This explosion again... It's Eira!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What is going on!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's coming from the other end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Emrys, go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Find the rest and run! I'll hold them here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oof... Is everyone okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Still in one piece...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Eira? Eira! Say something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No good... She's out cold. But I think she's unharmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...And so are you two, unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I owe you one, Red. That was impressive, tanking the blast like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Now, why don't you keep our guests occupied?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I think Berith is itching for a fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Heh... Not every day you meet someone who doesn't hit like a wet noodle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Come on, Red. It's playtime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Noted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Even the damned sword is talking. You Goetia are really something else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Blair looks around for an exit, taking note of the crates piled along the walls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(These are highly flammable...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(If anything ignites them, they'll definitely cause a collapse!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(And where's Shion?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You're not laying a single hand on Eira while I still draw breath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Fine. Then watch over her from the afterlife! Hah hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Emrys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Emmy...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Emmy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yes, Eira. I'm here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>This time... I'll protect you.</td>
