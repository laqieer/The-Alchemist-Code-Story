<td>Alchemy?! What do you mean by this, Lord Waginau?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The Spiritbonding of the Sephira, this work of miracles gifted by Sephiron, is the original form of that which this world has deemed taboo: Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Alchemy was originally Spiritbonding?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Nimul and Emmel, the founders of Alchemy, were of the Sephira tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>With their deep understanding of Spiritbonding, they deciphered the wisdom engraved upon Sephiron and laid their hands on the Truth of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Truth. You have mentioned this word several times before. Lord Waginau, what is this Truth you speak of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Only the two founders know the answer to that question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Fortunately, the Tower of Babel still remains to lead us to that answer, and within it lies the Grand Excelsior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The Tower of Babel is said to have been the gate to the beyond, an imitation of Sephiron's role as the pillar of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>A gate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Why was such a thing built? If Spiritbonding was the foundation of Alchemy, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Having devoted your whole life to this technique in this small village, it is no wonder you would think like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Spiritbonding does have one major flaw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A flaw?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Only the Sephira can use Spiritbonding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Sephiron selectively chooses humans with potential and provides them with a key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>A key? You don't mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I do. The key is the sephirah upon your body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The mark every Sephira is born with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It was the symbol of a pact between Sephiron and the Sephira, the chosen people, that represented our right to wield powers above our station.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Nimul opposed this idea. He claimed Spiritbonding was a power that should be granted to all and help bring peace to the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>For this, Alchemy was created and the Tower of Babel was built to be the door accessible to all who seek this power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But...in all the stories, it was Nimul himself who destroyed the tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Nobody knows what Nimul saw when he crossed over to the beyond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Whatever it was, it caused the tower to be destroyed and the door was closed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Closed? How...? Alchemy yet exists in this world. That is why we have the Magna Code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The Alchemy we have in this world is merely the remnant of what Emmel left us through the Holy Order of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Now it does little more than utilize the Alchemia of this continent to shape the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Though it is still far more dangerous than magic, Alchemy as it is today is nothing compared to the Alchemy Source that drew power directly from Truth itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Today's alchemists simply cannot recreate miracles of the same caliber as the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But Spiritbonding can?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes. Spiritbonding is connected to the Truth through another path, Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I assume I do not need to explain what would happen if the Sephira people knew of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
