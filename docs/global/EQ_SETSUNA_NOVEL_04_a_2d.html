<td>Setsuna...</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/mash.png" alt="Macherie" height="128"><br>Macherie</td>
<td>Well, the Shrine Monarch had a vision. She said there's something here that I need to retrieve for the ritual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sets.png" alt="Setsuna" height="128"><br>Setsuna</td>
<td>We know that much, but why did it have to be you?</td>

<tr>

<td>She said that I'm...special.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sets.png" alt="Setsuna" height="128"><br>Setsuna</td>
<td>Is it something to do with your eyes? Or the fact that you can read the wind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/mash.png" alt="Macherie" height="128"><br>Macherie</td>
<td>I'm not sure, but it might have something to do with the fact that I'm still an apprentice.</td>

<tr>

<tr>

<td>So we need to get the jewel that's enshrined in this ruin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/mash.png" alt="Macherie" height="128"><br>Macherie</td>
<td>Yes. Then I need to bring the jewel to the shrine so that they can place it on the staff used in the ritual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sets.png" alt="Setsuna" height="128"><br>Setsuna</td>
<td>But why is such an important item of the village hidden in a ruin so far away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/mash.png" alt="Macherie" height="128"><br>Macherie</td>
<td>Apparently it brings about misfortune and calamity when kept in the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/mash.png" alt="Macherie" height="128"><br>Macherie</td>
<td>The shrine maidens are responsible for bringing blessings, and keeping such unhappy things away from the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/mash.png" alt="Macherie" height="128"><br>Macherie</td>
<td>I was told that our ancestors kept the jewel here to ensure the village's safety, only bringing it out for rituals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sets.png" alt="Setsuna" height="128"><br>Setsuna</td>
<td>Whatever the reason, now we know what to get. So let's—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sets.png" alt="Setsuna" height="128"><br>Setsuna</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/mash.png" alt="Macherie" height="128"><br>Macherie</td>
<td>What is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jayme</td>
<td>H-hey, Sis? I have a bad feeling about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sets.png" alt="Setsuna" height="128"><br>Setsuna</td>
<td>Indeed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sets.png" alt="Setsuna" height="128"><br>Setsuna</td>
<td>Whatever that is, I don't think it's going to make this easy for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sets.png" alt="Setsuna" height="128"><br>Setsuna</td>
<td>Both of you, stay back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
