<td>Odd... It seems like the monsters didn't live here, but were just chasing something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Setsuna, look! There's a light over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That's...Macherie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That voice! Is that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Sis! We found you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Jayme?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Macherie, I'm so relieved you're safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Setsuna... What are you two doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We were worried about you, Sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We were concerned about how you've been lately, so we went to the shrine and were told you were here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You came all this way just for that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What do you mean, just for that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It was a big enough deal that Jayme decided he had to come find you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Jayme... I see. Thank you, and I am sorry for making you worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's all right. I'm just glad to see you're okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I feel terrible. I made you two worry because I still have so much left to learn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You don't have to worry about that. Don't be so hard on yourself, because—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Nothing. Never mind. I'm just glad no one got hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(I guess it is pretty hypocritical of me to tell her not to be so hard on herself.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Setsuna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Anyway, it's your turn to explain. What are you doing here alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well, the Shrine Monarch had a vision. She said there's something here that I need to retrieve for the ritual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We know that much, but why did it have to be you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>She said that I'm...special.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Is it something to do with your eyes? Or the fact that you can read the wind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm not sure, but it might have something to do with the fact that I'm still an apprentice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I need more training like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What is this training supposed to accomplish, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to sound like I was judging you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(I'm sure it's for Jayme's sake.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So, what is it that you need to retrieve?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Let's get it and go home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What? Oh, no, I can't trouble you two any further!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's no trouble at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I want to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But... Well, I suppose you're right. I really appreciate it, you two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>So we need to get the jewel that's enshrined in this ruin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes. Then I need to bring the jewel to the shrine so that they can place it on the staff used in the ritual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But why is such an important item of the village hidden in a ruin so far away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Apparently it brings about misfortune and calamity when kept in the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The shrine maidens are responsible for bringing blessings, and keeping such unhappy things away from the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I was told that our ancestors kept the jewel here to ensure the village's safety, only bringing it out for rituals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Whatever the reason, now we know what to get. So let's—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>H-hey, Sis? I have a bad feeling about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Indeed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Whatever that is, I don't think it's going to make this easy for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Both of you, stay back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'll take care of this!</td>
</tr>
