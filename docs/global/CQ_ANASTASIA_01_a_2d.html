<td>A secret weapon indeed. I'm feared by both myÂ enemies and people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Thanks to that, like the previous battle, there are times when I remain on standby until the end.</td>

<td>Heheh...</td>

<td>That's a sad smile.</td>

<td>Me? I'm Fung Liu. I've been here all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This place is quiet...so I can focus on my knitting.</td>

<td>I see. I'm Anastasia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I know. You're famous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>In that case, do you know this? They call me a secret weapon. People shouldn't try to get close to me.</td>

<tr>

<td>Somehow I feel like you have a similar vibe to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes. So you're also bored from not being sent out onto the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh? If I don't have to go out to the battlefield, then there's no harm in that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Right. I guess that's the normal reaction. But, if that's true, then the two of us are different after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Lady Anastasia! The enemy attack has us unexpectedly cornered! Please help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Understood. I'll head there right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It looks like it's my turn to do my job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What is it? Is there something else you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Umm... Be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes, thank you. You too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
