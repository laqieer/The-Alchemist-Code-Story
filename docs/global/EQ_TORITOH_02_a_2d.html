<td>002</td>
<td>Then you had someone like that, as well. I'm glad.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Was there someone like that for you?</td>

<td>Someone that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I don't know if I can call him a friend, but... Yes, there was someone like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You liked him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>N-no, not like that! Not that he wasn't important to me, or...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Heheheh. Your face is all red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Stop mocking me and get on with your story. There is a point to it, isn't there?</td>

<td>010</td>
<td>Ngh...!</td>

<td>011</td>
<td>Keep your wits about you, Toritoh!</td>

<td>What was that? It was like my life force was being sucked away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The mortal sin that Lucifer embodies...Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It absorbs Alchemia and the very life forces of those who end up inside of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This is the world between life and death, so basically, those who don't move on after death end up here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Those who haven't yet acknowledged their deaths, those that cannot accept it... Pride can make them all succumb...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So those souls end up wandering this world forever?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's not all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Seriously?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If they are in this world for too long, then they will be completely taken over by Lucifer and become its puppets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Thus, they wander aimlessly through this world for eternity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>They're clearly targeting us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I came here as one of the living and not as a mere soul, and so, they're trying to force me to submit to Lucifer's power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I refuse to give in. Toritoh...will you lend me your power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Of course. I certainly do not want to lose and end up like them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I have no intention of letting anyone oppress me ever again!</td>
