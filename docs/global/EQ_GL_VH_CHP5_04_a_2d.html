<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Truth be told, I had expected this to happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Sieg hasn't been the same since that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I don't blame him for wanting to do something. Anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>All we can do is hope he keeps himself safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I have no doubt that he will, Miss Blair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Emrys, I understand that you first traveled in search of both your sister and a cure for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We would be glad of your assistance, but this is also far more than you bargained for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That is true, but I cannot in good conscience abandon those who have gone so far for my sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hehe! Now that's what I like to see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We'll keep trying, Emrys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Eira is doing well keeping her Alchemia in check, but it'll get harder as she grows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We'll find a way to cure her before anything bad happens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I appreciate all that you have done, truly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You've got to be kidding me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Live and let live, Siegfried. Perhaps it is for the best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm gonna take a walk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Do you think he'll...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I know him well enough, my dear. He just needs some space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh, yes. Soren, about your visions of Lachesis and the Elylon Teg...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Do you think you would be able to take a look at Eira's condition?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh! Right! Eira's Alchemia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>She's not in any danger now, but it IS a tad high...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Let's see if we can do anything about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...Uh... What do I do here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hehe! Master's so silly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Sit back and watch me work my magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Easy, Eira. I'm right here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ready? Here goes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hm? Nothing's changed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Is something wrong? Eira, did it hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Eira...feel okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Mm... I think I lost some functionality while I was deactivated...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh. Well, I guess it was worth a try, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(Guess my past is still a mystery, huh?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Lachesis holds Eira's hands tightly in her own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm sorry I can't help you much right now, Eira. I think my systems are all woozy-sleepy still.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But I promise! When we fix this mess and Master gets his memories back, 'Lucky Sis' will make you right as rain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Promise...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Something occurs to me. If Lachesis is one of your creations...might she be able to locate Atropos?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We might be able to remotely deactivate the Core without plunging into the heart of Greed Dike, provided we can reach them undetected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's a good idea. I'll go check on those cloaking devices, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Let me accompany you, Blair. Lachesis has given me an idea about Alchemia levels, and I think the sensors could benefit from such a functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Of course, Professor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Be careful, you two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Let us go by the backwoods. I know a shortcut to the Greed Dike borders, though I concede it may not be the safest. Be on your guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wait up, Master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Eira go too! Big Broooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Eira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(She's certainly grown braver... Perhaps I have been overprotective.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>- Goetia, Greed Dike branch laboratory -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Based on the notes we retrieved from the seized estate, the Core has been restored to an estimated two-thirds of its capacity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It is ready to move on to the next round of testing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Excellent. Everything is in order then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yes, Master Li Wang. All proceeds apace, and we await only your command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hah! Let's not keep the party waiting, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Rows and rows of rudimentary Construct shells hooked up to a partially reconstructed Atropos Core hum softly in the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>On the lower level, several researchers scurry between them, making the final adjustments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What news?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Nesha hands over a small binder, and Li Wang's smile grows wider as he flips through it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Impressive. Zheng Yi may be able to keep his muzzle tightly shut through all the punishment, but the rest of his house certainly isn't as willing to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Excellent work as always, Nesha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I aim to impress, Master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Schedule this for the next round, and we'll see about increasing the load.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Understood, Master Li Wang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hmph. With an army as impressive as this, no one in Greed Dike could muster the will or the power to resist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Shame I'm not the one giving orders here. Heaven only knows what on Babel the Director wants with these.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What are we but cogs in the machine? Yet some of us serve more readily than others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Not I, Nesha. Not I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Too long have I suffered under ignominy... I won't tolerate anyone looking down upon me ever again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>One day, it'll be me on that seat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Oh, the look on that insufferable Queen's face! I can't wait to see her beg at my feet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Suddenly, a loud siren wails throughout the lab.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>*WHIRRRRR*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>W-What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Aaaghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>The Core! It's going haywire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Tch... Of all the times...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Nesha! With me. Before word gets out about this unsightly mess.</td>
</tr>
