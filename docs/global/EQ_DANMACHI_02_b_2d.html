<td>Demons all scattered about... Something smells real fishy here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You need to be more careful! This really isn't the time for bravado like that, Ila.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Just stay out of my way! I don't need protection from the likes of you; I can handle myself just fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You were in danger, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I would've been fine on my own! You've got some nerve thinking you have some say in whether I need help or not...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Okay, okay. Let's all take a deep breath, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No one got hurt, right? So it all worked out just fine in the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The way Bell fights, it's easy to tell he's got his friends in mind at all times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Sure, maybe he started out his adventure with impure motives, but those moves don't lie:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>He's someone who cares for his friends, and that's his primary motivation now. There's no doubt in my mind about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Kevin...! Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Aspiring to be an adventurer means aspiring to be a hero, too. I also learned that from listening to my grandpa...for whatever that may be worth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This grandpa of yours must've been a big influence on you, from how it sounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He was. But after he passed away, I was left all alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>All alone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The person who took me in after that, and treated me like family on top of it all, is my goddess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>To be honest with you, my reason for becoming an adventurer is still...something I aspire to. But now that I am one, it's not my only goal anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Meeting Lili, having Welf and Mikoto lend me their strength... I've grown so much closer to everyone as time went on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I was even able to rescue Haruhime. I was able to push myself to fight even harder for the sake of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Everyone in my Familia is someone I think of as family, and I want more than anything to protect them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Not to mention my goddess, Hestia. I want to protect her, too. Especially after bungling the job before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I just wasn't strong enough on my own, and I wound up causing trouble for everyone instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I was disappointed in myself, so I decided I'd try to get stronger. No... I swore that I would get stronger! No matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ila, I'm sure you think the worst of me after hearing my reason for becoming an adventurer, but I want you to at least see me for the person I've become, not the person I was at the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...I can't stand you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ila...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I can't stand you. But I get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I don't know your friends, but you clearly have their support, and they have yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I wanted to get stronger too... Strong enough that I could do everything on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But that's not how things work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You need other people to rely on. You need...friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ooh! So does this mean you've made up, now, and we're all friends again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We're not friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That's what you say. But I bet somewhere deep down, you actually do think of me as one, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Grrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I can't stand you! You're the worst!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Haha. Well, Bell, it looks like you've redeemed yourself after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Except I think she dislikes you more than ever now...</td>
