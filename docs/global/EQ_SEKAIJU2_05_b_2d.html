<td>Hmm. It all began when this world became linked with Arcania.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>When that occurred, some Alchemia Particles slipped through a chink in the fabric of our world and into yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Alraune allowed herself to be swept into that current, and that is how she came to be in Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>There lay a Philosopher's Stone, waiting to be found, and who should obtain it but Alraune? She used its immense power to form a point of connection between our worlds.</td>

<td>Hence why you three were brought here without passing through the Door of Truth.</td>

<td>Why would Alraune bring us here?</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Alraune coveted that sweet, glitter glow, as well as the strength that lies behind it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>If you had been unable to subdue Alraune, her power would have increased, until Green Death ran rampant across the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>It would likely have meant the end of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/sq_pal.png" alt="Protector" height="128"><br>Protector</td>

<td>Hey, Ouroboros! Do you know what happened to those soldiers in the forest?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Do not worry. They have left the forest now, safe and sound. Alraune lies defeated, and the monsters of the forest have become placid once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/fenc.png" alt="Fencer" height="128"><br>Fencer</td>
<td>Phew! That's good to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Now then. I am not sure that this even needs to be said...however, the door that would take you back to your world lies here, and it is open to you.</td>
</tr>

<td>You may go home. On the other hand...</td>
