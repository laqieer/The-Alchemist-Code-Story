<td>002</td>
<td>I don't think you've ever seen us like this, but I'm sure you still recognize us, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm Kaede's daughter, Mikaboshi, and this is my little brother, Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This is some sort of ruse. Why would you two be here?! Wh-what even is this place?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I dunno, but I have a feeling my big sister can answer that. Am I right, Mikaboshi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is the world within the blade Sumeragi. It was impossible for you to enter this place before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But this time, your horn was used to reforge it, and it's that intrinsic link which allowed us to meet here now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's all thanks to Amane's Alchemic power. Though, that does mean our time here is pretty limited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Amane...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We don't need to fight. What we need now is to talk. So I made sure we had all the right people here for the conversation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I want you to remember everything. Together, we can return Wadatsumi to the way it's supposed to be. To the way you once knew it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You know the potential this land has. I just need you to remember it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I know no such thing! It is our prerogative to eliminate the humans and reconstruct this land as a country for demons. That, and that alone, is what Wadatsumi is supposed to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Will you let us take care of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I didn't think I'd ever see the day I could fight alongside you again, Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Make sure not to slow me down, though, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That goes for you, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>D-don't either of you dare stand in my way! If you do, I'll cut you down as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We're not going to go down that easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If words aren't enough to reach you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then we'll be happy to let our swords do the talking!</td>
