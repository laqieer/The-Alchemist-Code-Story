<td>Balt scolded me as well. He told me not to underestimate the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>Besides, if I had died, I would lose the network of people that I've worked so hard to build and I'd also break the promise that I made.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/elai.png" alt="Elaine" height="128"><br>Elaine</td>

<td>When I was in the desert, I actually wanted something sour over sweet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/elai.png" alt="Elaine" height="128"><br>Elaine</td>
<td>Of course. If it's that hot, you could suffer from a heat stroke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>Right! I think there's a need for salt in the desert! I have to obtain some!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/elai.png" alt="Elaine" height="128"><br>Elaine</td>
<td>Look at you; a true merchant. Even when you fall, you have them pay you to get back up again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>Fall? What're you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/elai.png" alt="Elaine" height="128"><br>Elaine</td>
<td>Huh? I mean, you lost all your supplies that you brought with you on the caravan, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>No. Anyway, I learned about a much more valuable business prospect, so it doesn't matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>Besides, with the absence of bandits in the desert, I think trade across the desert will increase a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>Balt aims to create a land filled with trees and plants. They might have to start with an oasis, but I'm going to bring them the things they need!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/elai.png" alt="Elaine" height="128"><br>Elaine</td>
<td>Ahahah. How reliable of you, Elrike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>If I'm going to help Balt, trust will be even more important than before. I need to do my best to prepare!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>All right. Let's hurry back to Envylia so that I can start preparing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>Even while we're eating sweets, tell me about these things, Elaine. You enter the desert more often than me, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/elai.png" alt="Elaine" height="128"><br>Elaine</td>
<td>Fine, fine. I need to teach how to properly defend yourself as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>A land overflowing with trees and plants...an oasis. I need to do my best to make my business strive!</td>
