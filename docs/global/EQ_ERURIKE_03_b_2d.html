<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Arghh! Balt, you scum...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's a worthy end to a villainous sorry-excuse of a mercenary. Go make amends to your victims in the after life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Aghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's over, Elrike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Where are the children?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>All the children in the hideout are safe. Now, all we can do is search for the record books and see if we can investigate their trail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>He-hey, are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Y-yes. Now that everything is okay, I suddenly feel faint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You did well. With the amount of courage you have, it's almost regretful you're a merchant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But how did they know where the hideout was?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's thanks to this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The chain on your leg? You said it was a memento of your comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(Oh! That's right. He said it served another purpose too.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>In this road less dessert, we are all bound together by this chain, even those of us who are gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What?! That's amazing! Is that something specific to this desert?! Or is there a special craftsman?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh, but...if it's a memento then...ah, nothing. Sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wh-what's gotten into you all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>How would you expect a merchant to react after encountering something so rare? But never mind that right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hmm. As I must also report about what occurred here, I'm going to head back to Gluttony Foss. What are you going to do, Elrike?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'll...return to Envylia once. After all, I've lost all my goods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see. Well, if you feel like you want to cross this desert again then call me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No, let me help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I don't have that chain, but...I have my network of people that I have encountered as a merchant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I don't want to end that connection here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's why, as a merchant, I want to help you return this dessert to the way that it used to be. After all...you'll need supplies, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Heh. A chain linked together by people, huh? You're quite the merchant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why thank you. Anyway, I'll be waiting for your order, all right? Oh, that's right...I should pay you for everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You don't have anything on hand, right? When I order supplies from you, just minus that amount from the costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huh, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>My comrades are calling me. I'll see you around, Elrike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But...! Wait, are you sure?! ...He's gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hey, next time you get involved in a big incident like this, try to put yourself in the shoes of those who are worried sick about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh, Elaine! Yeah. Thank you...and sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This time you were lucky and just happened to be with Balt from the Sand Hawks. Otherwise, you would've been dead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Also, it just so happened that I had been hired by the Guild. That's why I was able to come immediately, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Try to take better care of yourself next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hey, what's the matter?! You usually never let my lectures get you down! You look so depressed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Balt scolded me as well. He told me not to underestimate the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Besides, if I had died, I would lose the network of people that I've worked so hard to build and I'd also break the promise that I made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Mm. Okay. No matter talk of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Once we get back to Envylia, let's go eat something sweet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Are you sure? I don't have any goods on me and practically no money as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh well. I have you covered. Just think of it as a welcome-back-alive celebration. Actually, a really good shop just opened! I want to go there with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>In that case, I'll gladly accept it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>When I was in the desert, I actually wanted something sour over sweet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Of course. If it's that hot, you could suffer from a heat stroke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Right! I think there's a need for salt in the desert! I have to obtain some!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Look at you; a true merchant. Even when you fall, you have them pay you to get back up again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Fall? What're you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Huh? I mean, you lost all your supplies that you brought with you on the caravan, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>No. Anyway, I learned about a much more valuable business prospect, so it doesn't matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Besides, with the absence of bandits in the desert, I think trade across the desert will increase a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Balt aims to create a land filled with trees and plants. They might have to start with an oasis, but I'm going to bring them the things they need!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ahahah. How reliable of you, Elrike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>If I'm going to help Balt, trust will be even more important than before. I need to do my best to prepare!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>All right. Let's hurry back to Envylia so that I can start preparing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Even while we're eating sweets, tell me about these things, Elaine. You enter the desert more often than me, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Fine, fine. I need to teach how to properly defend yourself as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>A land overflowing with trees and plants...an oasis. I need to do my best to make my business strive!</td>
</tr>
