<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Father...! What is his condition?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We tended to him, but we only have temporary measures. Eventually, his body will begin to corrupt again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There is still no true way to purify the blight of the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No...! Are you saying that there is no way to save him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Any possibility would lie with our Sprite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Sprite who is well-trained in the ways of Mother Nature may know of some way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>He took on the curse to protect me and the children of our village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I will deliver him to the Sprite!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>To Voda...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes. In any case, I am a wind shaman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I must report about Gluttony Foss's invasion, the truth about the raids, and what I have witnessed with my own eyes. Don't you agree, father?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Don't worry about me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ever since I began investigating the Jam eco-system, I knew something like this would happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>My failure has caused considerable trouble for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I would like to apologize to the people of the Toxotes tribe for this disturbance. I am Mocca...from the Neva tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Please, raise your head. I am the one who should thank you for saving my daughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Please, it was nothing. Saving a fellow individual from Saga is the least I could do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The Neva tribe...are you from the Fire Sprite Fuu's faction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>My tribe belongs to that faction, yes. As for myself, I have no intention of being tied down to any faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But...neutral trading villages are one thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But it is prohibited to enter villages of other tribes unless in the event of an emergency. You are aware of that, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I believe that all of Saga is currently in a state of emergency.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You said that you were investigating the Jam's eco-system, didn't you? Are you talking about that outbreak we had?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Indeed. It's not just limited to this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I learned this from having traveled across the land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>All across Saga there have been mass outbreaks of the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If this situation is left like this, it will develop into a serious situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I've been investigating the Jam's source while alerting each tribe I travel to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But...why are you doing this on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If this situation is so dire, then shouldn't those of the Neva tribe work with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I am working alone because of the tribal boundaries you just mentioned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If I were to go around with my tribe, there is a possibility that other tribes would not accept me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>So...what does any of that have to do with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You said that you were looking for me...didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Looking for Tina...? What does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Please, I would like to request that you leave her in my care for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wh-what...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Tina is...a wind shaman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ever since the destruction of the Alize people, there have been no Shamans to take on the title of Wind Sprite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The wind crystal Matter has lost its power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And wind shamans are no longer being born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I believe that the massive outbreaks of Jam began when the wind Matter lost its power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What does that have to do with my power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>To settle this problem and return peace to this land...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I believe that the Sprite Quartet must be restored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>To do so, it is crucial to restore the power of wind Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If someone with the power of a Sprite can shower the wind Matter with their Ouija, I believe it will regain its strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I would like to ask for her assistance in this...as a wind shaman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Y-you want me...to restore the wind Matter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>To be honest...I thought I was chasing an impossible dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>But...I actually managed to find her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>In the fight just now, I sensed her potential as a wind shaman...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It filled me with the desire to bring her full potential to fruition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Please. Would you let me take her with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>We could revive the wind and bring back the equilibrium of the past...and restore peace to Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But why does one of Fuu wield the wind Matter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Excuse me, Chief Adone! We've identified what appears to be a Gluttony soldier on the outskirts of the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>How large is their army?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>W-well...there's only one of them! However, this is no ordinary individual!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Father! I'll go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>When I think of the village...my instincts tell me to stay. But when I think about Saga as a whole...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>There he is! Over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Who are you? Weren't you supposed to go and fetch Chief Adone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Tsk! I am Adone's daughter, Tina, the eventual 45th chief who will lead the Toxotes tribe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Oh? In that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Show me what you're made out of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
