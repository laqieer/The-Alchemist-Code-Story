<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/moca.png" alt="Mocca" height="128"><br>Mocca</td>
<td>I am working alone because of the tribal boundaries you just mentioned.</td>

<tr>

<td>And wind shamans are no longer being born.</td>
</tr>

<td>To settle this problem and return peace to this land...</td>

<td>I believe that the Sprite Quartet must be restored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/moca.png" alt="Mocca" height="128"><br>Mocca</td>
<td>To do so, it is crucial to restore the power of wind Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
