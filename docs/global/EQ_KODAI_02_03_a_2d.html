<td>Anyway--</td>

<td>Well, to be honest, I kinda figured you'd take off as soon as I told you how to kill a dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/math.png" alt="Matia" height="128"><br>Matia</td>
<td>Please, I'm not that heartless. I mean, I am heartless, but not *that* heartless.</td>

<td>You do realize that staying with me puts a target on your back...</td>

<td>Erm, at any rate, did you need something from us?</td>

<td>...Maybe.</td>
