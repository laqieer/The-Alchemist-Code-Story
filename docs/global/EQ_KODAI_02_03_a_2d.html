<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey hey, Carnet, you're not stealing again, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...Will you shut up? I'll win next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Even so, you're all outta cash, aren't you? Or what, are you gonna steal from Lord Aedith's pocketbook again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's not stealing, all right? His money is my money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm the only reason he's still alive, so sharing his cash is the least he can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...Speaking of which, it seems there was another attempt on Lord Aedith's life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There certainly have been a lot of those lately. That man has made more than his fair share of enemies...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Resentment, grudges, karma... They're all a load of crap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Life speeds by like a bullet, and we've all pulled the trigger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Once it smashes into something, the journey's over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...Well, you're right that we've only got one life to live, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hey Carnet! Lord Aedith is calling for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...Time to get to work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>All right, well watch yourself out there, Carnet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Lord Aedith cares about you, you know. He couldn't bear to lose you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Thanks, but we're not like that at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You called for me, Aedith?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ah, there you are, my angel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So? Who am I gonna kill next?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, you certainly get right to the point. Some of the others around here could stand to learn a thing or two from that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What's with all the flattery today? Did something bad happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I barely said a thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah, but, well... Just a bit of trouble with someone, but nothing to concern yourself about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I won't. So what's the job?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh, I have quite the wholesome assignment for you today. There are some vermin infesting this layer and I need you to be my exterminator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Vermin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>--Target in sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Graaaaa!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Kill confirmed. That's gotta be the last of 'em...right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Such a pain in the ass...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>How did I get stuck out here hunting beasts? When he said "vermin," I didn't think he meant *actual* vermin! What the hell is he thinking...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...Tch</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Wait, that sound... A dragon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...Well you did better than I expected, at least... But your landing could use some work...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well sorry, but it's the best I could do given the circumstances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yeah, it looks like they shot through your wing joint. You're not gonna die, but it's not great either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I don't think I can fly anymore. And becoming a dragon again is off the table for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>*sigh* ...But we sure did manage to escape, didn't we!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>This must be...the Sloth Layer? The layers are all in flux here, so it's hard to say just how far we came.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>For now, we should just look for a settlement. We need to get your wounds treated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Does something like that even exist out here? I heard the Sloth Layer is deserted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Well, it's true there are no dragons out this far, but there should still be plenty of people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh, I see... I'm a bit worried that I might stand out, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You're not wrong there. But they say this is the kind of place where everyone stands out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The Sloth Layer is a land of corruption and depravity--a melting pot of all the worst parts of humanity, forsaken by even the most merciful of dragons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hey, you over there... How about a little fun? I'm cheaper than I look...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>How about some gold?! Takes decor to the next level! Cures what ails ya! Or how about a full set of gold teeth?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Watch where you're going! You wanna die!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Yep, the Sloth Layer's largest pleasure district...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Redington.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>"Pleasure," like...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>People don't shy away from their desires here. In Redington, pleasure is life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It looks like it's grown quite a bit since I was last here though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Come to think of it, you said you were on a trip, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yeah, didn't you realize? I'm on my honeymoon... Not. I'm traveling solo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>At any rate, this isn't the kind of place you'd want to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>For everyone here, their own enjoyment comes first. They couldn't care less about anyone else. In other words, it's the perfect place to hide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Plus I've got a few old acquaintances here. They should be able to help us out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...You've been helping me out, so maybe I shouldn't say this, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You don't seem like the kind of person who'd have a lot of friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Pfft, and just what's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Or, maybe you hadn't noticed, yourself...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Heh, heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What are you on about? ...Look, stop gawking at everything around you before you crash into something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>No, it's just I've never seen this many people all at once before and--ow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...Anyway, for now let's just get you treated and get some rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Follow me. The inn I used to stay at is down here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...A dragon? Here? ...I should tell Aedith about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ow, ow, ow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Stop squirming! This salve from my hometown works wonders, but it stains, so sit still.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Oi! I said sit still!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...Hey, watch it! You're going to give me even more scars!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>So then stop moving. ...Ok, that should do it for the treatment. How's the wing? Can you move it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Not really. I don't think this wound is going to heal so easily. Something about that bullet must be disrupting the Magil...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Yishai Ignacio... They say his gun can kill dragons. And from the looks of it, it was no exaggeration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I could sure use a weapon like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I don't know if you're dextrous enough to handle a delicate weapon like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Hmph, rude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Anyway--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I really appreciate how you helped me, Matia. It's because of you that I escaped from Ophioneus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>We had a deal, remember? I'm just holding up my end. Make sure you do the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Well, to be honest, I kinda figured you'd take off as soon as I told you how to kill a dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Please, I'm not that heartless. I mean, I am heartless, but not *that* heartless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You do realize that staying with me puts a target on your back...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I'm counting on it. That Yishai guy should make another appearance sooner or later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>...What, are you looking for a fight, or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You know the best thing about you? You've got a lot of enemies. That's why I like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>That is *not* the best thing about me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Hey there, girls! You got a moment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Eep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What do you think you're doing, entering a girl's room without knocking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>If I didn't already know you, you'd be dead right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>What about you--trying to kill someone all of a sudden in their own establishment!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Do you two...know each other?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Yeah, last time I was in this layer, I saved this poor guy's life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>And I gave you free food for a month, so how about a little gratitude?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>...Did that happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Yes!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Erm, at any rate, did you need something from us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Right, right. I was actually gonna ask you to take on a job like last time. You're still broke, I assume.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...Maybe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>(What does it take to get a straight answer out of this girl?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>There've been some beasts running amok around town lately. The merchants have already been attacked several times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>And?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>In this town, other people's problems can make for a good source of income. The town's leader, Lord Aedith, has offered a reward to anyone who can get rid of 'em.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>So how about it? Think you're up to the task?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Hmm, sounds interesting...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Let's do it, Schmeier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Ok, well you stay safe out there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>You're coming too. Get off the bed and let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>But I'm hurt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Come on, just spit on it or something and it'll heal right up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I already told you it's not healing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Well, we've got no choice. There's no such thing as a free meal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>But you got a whole month of free meals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>We'll take the job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Well all right then. I'm counting on you girls!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>...That girl is something else. Never thought she'd bring a dragon guest to my inn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I can't even remember how many years it's been since I saw one of them in this layer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>...I'm just going to tell you now: I can't do anything but provide some support.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>That'll be plenty. I just need you here to lure in the beasts. They love the smell of blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>So you're just using me as a piece of meat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>What's wrong with meat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>GRAAAAAAHHHH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Looks like we've got some takers already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>...Hold on. There's something strange about those beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>What's with all this magil? Creatures like them shouldn't be able to hold anywhere near that much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Is that so? Well, we'll see how strong they are without their heads. Take this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Hey! Are you even listening to me!?</td>
</tr>
