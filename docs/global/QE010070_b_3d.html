<td>This is the ruins of Fort Mugarde! Where's Agatha...? Agatha!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We meet again, boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Sabareta!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So, it was you not Zeke who led the Blue Flame Guard here. Well, that's somewhat anticlimactic.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Where is Agatha?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>She's been imprisoned in a cell. It's deep within the dungeon and is crowded with monsters who've consumed Philosopher's Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Whatâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>My apologies, but I'm pressed for time. I must go and resurrect an ancient weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The Philosopher's Stones... You're planning on resurrecting the Demon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Heheh... Will you save the girl first? Or will the Demon be resurrected first? We shall see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sabareta, you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Is there nothing left for me to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I know that this will bring sorrow and suffering to everyone. Yet, can I only observe helplessly from the sidelines?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Is there no way we can resist this tragic fate? Is this the end that the gods desire for us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No...! It can't be! As long as we are alive, there must be meaning to it all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We live, and so we are allowed to dream of a peaceful future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Please stop this mistaken choice, this future that threatens to be stained with the cycle of sorrow!</td>
