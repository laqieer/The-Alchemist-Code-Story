<td>Well... I see now that there's no way I can beat you. Clearly, it was no fluke that you managed to successfully fight your way through six of the Belt Regions.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>But my work here is done, anyway; my mission complete. Now that you have been thoroughly distracted, I must take my leave. Farewell!</td>

<td>Stop, Adaleigh! Don't chase after him.</td>

<tr>

<td>But if we don't stop himâ€”!</td>

<td>I know. But if we pursue him, we'll just be playing right into his hands. We need to prioritize regrouping with Nimul first and foremost. We've wasted enough time here.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're right. Sorry, I wasn't thinking clearly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. We all lose our heads sometimes. Now come on; we stick out like a sore thumb here. Let's get moving!</td>

<td>Right!</td>

<td>(Nimul really does have a choice to make, though. And if things continue as they are, I fear his hand may be forced...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(He's the kind of man, after all, who would give himself up if it meant he could save the world.)</td>
