<td>Well... I see now that there's no way I can beat you. Clearly, it was no fluke that you managed to successfully fight your way through six of the Belt Regions.</td>

<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>But my work here is done, anyway; my mission complete. Now that you have been thoroughly distracted, I must take my leave. Farewell!</td>
