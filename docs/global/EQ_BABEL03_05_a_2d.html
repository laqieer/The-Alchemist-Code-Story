<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>This is our settlement. We found you passed out on the edge of town and carried you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I see... So I survived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You should try and stay still. Your injuries are still healing. I'm Carla, and this is Hawk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What about you? You got a name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Name's Balt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Nice to meet you. You can rest here for a while. If it suits you, that is. Hahaha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well, you shouldn't push yourself while you're injured. If you hang around even after you're all better, though... Well, that's just negligent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Call me if you need anything. You can use this room as you see fit. I'll come back later, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What should I do now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You really are a tenacious one, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, it seems like you've started to care as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Heheh, that's true. You've been praying so much... If these crops don't start sprouting soon, we'll be in trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You shouldn't be up and about! Wait, but if you don't also push yourself a little, it'll take you longer to get better. Huh... Well, you know yourself best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm watering the seeds that I've planted here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>In a place like this? But that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>See, even Balt agrees! Hawk just keeps saying that he'll make them grow, no matter what! He won't listen to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You'll never know unless you try. I'm fond of this desert, you know, so I want to protect it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Protect the desert, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes, exactly! I want to revive the plants and trees in this region, to make it so that more people can live here. The desert is a dry, harsh place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's why people's hearts are dry and harsh here, too—at least, that's what I think. That's why I want to do what I can to enrich them, starting with the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But doesn't living in the desert mean living in a dry, harsh place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If you live in the desert, then I'm sure you already know this, but...when Sephiron was still around, life still thrived in the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>However, after the great tree was lost, life in the desert began to dwindle. I believe that this is because Sephiron's power of regeneration was lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Water, sand...and life. Everything is part of a cycle, but now there is nothing to complete it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The circle of life, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Life moves in a circle. Those that die turn to sand, become stars, and then watch over us forevermore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Life hasn't completely disappeared from this land. Look, there's a hawk flying over there. You know, there's a legend in the desert that birds carry life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If birds still fly here, then that means that life isn't truly gone. We just can't see it. Its potential is hidden, just like the seeds I've buried in the soil here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So regeneration isn't impossible. We just need someone to make it big enough for us to see. That's why I'm growing crops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This is just the first step. No matter how great a mountain seems at first, if you just keep climbing, eventually you will reach the top.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's what I hope... No. No, this isn't just hope. I have faith in the desert and the people who live here, so I know it can be done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I have to believe. You have to do everything you can to protect the things you care about. Balt, I'm sure you understand what I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Protecting the things you care about...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ah, gosh darnit! You're so honest and strong-willed, I can't believe you're the same guy who is completely useless when it comes to physical strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Protecting the desert is a bit vague, and I don't really understand what you mean—but I know you can do it, Hawk! I believe in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Heheh... I don't have time to waste being hesitant, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Neither do I! That's why I've decided that I'm going to protect you, Hawk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I see... Rather than standing around worrying, I should spend my time getting stronger...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So that I can protect the things I care about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wait! Where are you going? Your injuries...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If I have time to rest, I have time to train and get stronger. That's what I want to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's important that you let your injuries heal properly! Okay, okay. I have a proposition for you. Once you're all better, I want you to spar with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>With you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Trust me, it wouldn't even be training if Hawk was your partner. We should spar and train each other up. You look pretty strong, yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>But you have to take it easy until then, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>In that case, I'd be grateful if you'd lend me a hand with caring for the crops during your recovery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>All right. Fine.</td>
</tr>
