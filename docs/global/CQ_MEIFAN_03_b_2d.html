<td>Supreme Commander! Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It is already over. If you are this slow to react in battle, you'll end up at the bottom of the sea in no time at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>M-my sincerest apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's fine. Despite your incompetence, I'm in a rather good mood. Now, take him away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ngh! Dangit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He's nothing more than a tool. I'm sure he has no information that's valuable to us—but it would be good to make an example of him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>As you wish, Supreme Commander. I will take my leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You can come out now, Vivi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Phew! That took way too long!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It can't be helped. That was important. I was hardly just wasting time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, I'd wrap up that kind of thing quickly if it was me. I have much more fun talking to you, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Why did you come here, Vivi? I believe I told you never to show your face before me again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Did you really think I'd forgive you so easily? I don't mind having you tortured, like I did with that intruder just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You wouldn't do that to me! I trust you, Mei Fang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Besides, it's normal for friends to come hang out once in a while!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>F-friends?! You would still call us that, even after all I have said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I have said some terrible things to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, that's the thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Mei Fang... I'm really sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I didn't mean to upset you. I didn't know you hated sea cucumbers so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I wanted to apologize earlier, but I got stuck finishing that job. I... I really am sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Vivi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(Trusting others leads only to weakness. That is why I don't need friends.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(However...Vivi trusts me. She even calls me her friend.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(Surely that cannot be weakness. Yes... I will choose to trust her as well.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>N-no. I am the one...who should apologize. I...was a little harsh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Really? A little?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Wh-what?! I have never apologized to anyone before! You should be grateful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hahah! I'm just kidding! So, now we're all made up, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Tch. You really are insolent. Heehee... Ahahahaha! Oh, you do amuse me, Vivi.</td>
