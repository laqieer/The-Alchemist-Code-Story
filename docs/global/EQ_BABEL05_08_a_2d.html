<td>I didn't think I would be so disappointed to face the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This isn't like me at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I should know that longing cannot change anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>For it is already broken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Now, I have no means of reporting my observations of the past and future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If I attach a castor... Yeah, that should work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I rather overworked this one. Silly me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I can tell. The bottom's all worn out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The mount has a bearing built into it, so you should opt for a wheel radius on the bigger side that won't lean into it too much. That should give it what it needs to deal with uneven ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You'll want some elasticity in the tire component, and if you're not too picky about the price, you could go with a heavy-duty type like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Come to think of it, it'd probably be better to have a stopper, too. This machine is for some kind of research, isn't it? What sort of work do you do again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm investigating ancient ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I suppose that you could call me an observer of history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>An...observer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The drill sensor that I had you install last time was incredibly precise. I must say that I was impressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I just thought that something that can catch Alchemia directly would be better for geological surveys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, you were most correct. I have every faith in the castor that you've given me this time, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oof... It's really heavy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, sorry. Here, I'll help you turn it over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There are even more parts than there were last time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I've been to many places since then, and have had several skilled mechanics like yourself look over my gear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Antie just keeps getting fatter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Antie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's its name. Archeological Surveyor Antie, version 5.3.1. I think it fits rather nicely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yeah, it's...kinda cute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If you give something a name, you begin to feel attached to it, even if it happens to be a machine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What about that large machine over there? Doesn't it have a name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Not yet. It's a work in progress. My father and I are working on it together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>He hasn't been able to work on it much lately, though. It'll probably end up being finished after he... Well... That's why it doesn't have a name yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm sure you'll find a good name for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>All I can do is pretend that I don't know anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Isn't that right, Magnus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Slothstein - Ruins of an Ancient Babel Civilization</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>This castor really is superb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm glad I have a lantern with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I suppose I'll have to thank that blockhead the next time I see him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's necessary to light one's way in the darkness, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It seems the time has come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hello, Kaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Lord Waginau...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What is the Bishop of the Holy Order of Babel doing in a place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Surely you weren't caught unawares! Not the Crimson Dragon herself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Since leaving the Holy Guard, I have felt a presence dogging my every move, watching me from the shadows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Were you so conceited as to believe that no one would dare go after you, the possessor of the Alchemia Pura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I knew that if anyone did intend to come after me, they would likely come prepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>A definitive answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>An obvious one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You are approaching the Gates of Sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Sorry, I don't speak cryptic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>All will become clear to you in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well, it would have done. Meanwhile...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Both Magnus and I are to be...erased, I presume?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It's inevitable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>And now, I've learned something new.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What would that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>There is a truth that you are desperate to keep hidden at all costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>A little arrogant, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I'm not going anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You said it yourself, did you not? If anyone did intend to come after you, they would likely come prepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You may be confident of preserving your own life, but what of Zain's?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The time has come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Should you resist, you will be endangering not only Zain, but also the lives of all of the knights in the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I am afraid that you have little choice but to cooperate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>No... Nnnnrrgh! Haa...haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Are you saying that if I go quietly...you'll let them live?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I'm not saying any such thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>However, you would do best not to mislead yourself into thinking you can resist me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'm hardly...going to just play along!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Very well, then. One can only hope that you will reconsider.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Sometimes it is the most useful pawns who become the most troublesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The sound of a lantern smashing upon the ground echoes throughout the ruins.</td>
