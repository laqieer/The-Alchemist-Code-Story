<td>Huh? Am I still alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Why? I shouldn't be able to exist now that I'm severed from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes. I know. I've felt it all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It was for my sake that you almost destroyed this world. It was because I wished it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You collected the memories for me. You even tried to collect worlds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Your actions may have been misguided...but you were responding to my desire to connect with someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sorry. And thank you...for everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's okay. Let's embrace our eternal sleep together now, where we won't cause trouble for anybody.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I need to properly say goodbye to everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh? But...I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Okay. I'll do my best. Thank you...goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hmm. They managed to successfully sever just one-third of Rena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That was quite a risky idea. Sometimes humans can be so unpredictable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That might be what I like about them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh?! Everyone...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Rena! Ohhh, I'm sooo glad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Sakura?! Hey...don't wipe your eyes and nose on my clothes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Sakura, calm down a little. Phew... I'm glad everything went well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's really all thanks to you, <p_name>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Um... How did you manage to severe the Rayvner from me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Let me give you a brief explanation. Under normal circumstances, it would have been impossible to severe you from the Rayvner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>However, that human's wish opened the Door of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Here, only in this moment, your three worlds exist simultaneously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Therefore, you exist as three overlapping beings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>In contrast, the Rayvner exists between all dimensions. Thus, no matter how many worlds overlap, only one version of it will exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Taking advantage of this anomaly, I severed one-third of your existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This part of you contained only the past of your three existences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Altogether, your past amounted to one-third of who you are. This I left within the Rayvner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Right now your existence consists of two-thirds of youâ€”your present and future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I doubt it'll inconvenience you going forward, but, even if you were to run into the Rayvner again, you wouldn't recall your past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Just know that it's still not too late for me to use my powers to make you one with the Rayvner again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You decide: Discard your past and live a life without memories in an unfamiliar world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Or you can return to your past and embrace eternal sleep there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hey! What are you going on about, miniature Haoumaru?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wow. So much attitude, even after you know who Ouroboros is. Still, Sakura...in some ways I respect that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But it's true. Rena has to decide herself what she's gonna do from now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Rena! Of course, you should come with...mmphh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Sakura, hush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Mmmphhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I...I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well, let's meet again when we have the chance! Next time, I want to take things easy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Even if we are apart, I won't forget any of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Come on. Hurry and pass through the door. What a handful you have been until the very end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Sakura, Tyrfing, I'll see you again someday. You too, <p_name>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We can always meet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Somehow I think we will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Well then...good bye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>See you around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Take care, everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Let's go too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Um...well...I don't have any memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yes...but it'll be okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Rena, there are many splendid things that await you in your future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>So embrace your new life with your head held hide!</td>
