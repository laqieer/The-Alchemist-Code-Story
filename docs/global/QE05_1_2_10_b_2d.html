<td>I don't sense any darkness. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with her Alchemia, either...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It doesn't seem like it is the change in Sephiron that is affecting her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>So does that mean she'll be okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It seems like she just fainted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Th-that's good! Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm more concerned about Sephiron. What is that bright light?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The Sacred Stone is attempting to awaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Lord Waginau?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I came here as soon as I heard there was something unusual happening with Sephiron. Hm... I thought that might be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You know what is causing all this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I have an idea, but no proof. However, I know of another time Sephiron reacted in this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Tell us! What was it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It was Beelzebub. Someone came here with the intention of releasing the Sacred Stone, and Sephiron began to go into a frenzy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The bright light of Sephiron is a result of its attempt to awaken and purify the gluttonous power as it also begins to unfurl. It is trying to prevent these lands from being taken over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Sephiron is...attempting to awaken?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. That is Sephiron's role as that which holds a certain "door" within herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But...she is weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Lord Waginau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It is nothing. I am simply thinking out loud. Why don't you return home for the time being?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I heard that you were caring for a boy... Hisham, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>He will be quite distressed by these sudden changes as well, I suspect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This is true. Please excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Sephiron is old now. With this meager light, she will not be able to stop the curse of the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We must come up with a plan to stop this now. If not, the land will again be swarmed by the crushing jaws of gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>To prevent that, the Chief of this village must be courageous enough to call for a resurrection ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Father...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Malta... You're awake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Father, I received a prophecy from Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>One that said...the time for the resurrection ceremony draws near.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's... I see. If the great tree, Sephiron, demands it, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Forgive me, Malta, that I am so powerless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>No, I understand the situation, Father. To save this country, these lands... This is all that we have left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I am sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Kamui...</td>
