<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Dammit... You're pretty strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Thanks for the compliment! Now that you've had your fill, let's end it here, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No way, we're just getting started.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Uh? What are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hey now! Is that all you've got?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You said you were going to teach us a lesson, so I thought this was going to be fun. I'm pretty disappointed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The hell?! You've got some nerve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You there, what are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Magnus, Wilhelm! And you two! How dare you cause a ruckus at this hour...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hm? Why are you grabbing Wilhelm's lapels?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, um, I was just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well? Out with it, in detail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Uh... I apologize for any inconvenience caused by our personal fight within the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I have been reflecting deeply on how to avoid having this happen again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Uggghhh, this is so annoying! Why do we have to write a letter of apology for a simple fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Just think of it like practice. We're probably going to have to write a lot of these in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ugh. I'm not good at this sort of stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I didn't expect Vice-Captain Monzein would show up. What a great coincidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>'Course he would. I woke him up, so he probably rushed over to see what was up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What? You woke him up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Before I headed over to where you were, I swung by his room.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I decided to play a trick on him that would make him jump out of bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>So that's what that Alchemia spike was. I knew you were pulling something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So he was that pissed because he got woken up, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If you're really gonna fight seniors, isn't it better to have a third party watching?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If I hadn't been caught by them, what would you have done? You know he's watching us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If it hadn't worked out, he wouldn't've just punished us, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I've only lost when I give up on a bet before I've taken it. Looks like watching you has gotten me interested in gambling, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huh. You've got quite the character on you. But why would you go that far to help me out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Well, some delinquent wouldn't come back to our room even though we would both get in trouble if one of us got in trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I don't wanna be called a delinquent by you of all people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Besides, I was a little interested.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Interested in what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You've been spending all your time researching Alchemy since you joined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You think Alchemy research is probably useless just like those seniors did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>So why did you get that pissed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I already told you, I like Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yeah, that wasn't a lie. But it's a card you can throw away to hide the real card you've got up your sleeve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's a well-worn trick for a skilled gambler like you, hiding the truth within a truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Sorry, but I'm really good at reading people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>First you see through my tricks and now you're looking at my whole hand. You may hate gambling, but you've a talent for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You seem like a real hassle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You've got someone you care about, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I was right about you. You're a pain. But I guess it'll be hard to hide things from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Sigh... Still, it's not like it's that important of a reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I've got a little sister. Our mom told her that we wouldn't be able to see each other again after our parents split up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>"You have a brother who is aiming to become an excellent alchemist."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>"I'm sure he will become a great Paladin and a wonderful alchemist. He will be a brother that will make you proud," she said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What an irresponsible thing to say, right? But thanks to that, I had to become a brother she'd be proud of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That's why you quit the Wratharis Army and started researching Alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If her big brother becomes an Alchemy genius, that'll be something to be proud of, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Sounds like you're telling the truth. But I'm even more confused by you now. How can you do this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You're betting your life on something for a sister you haven't seen in forever and don't know if you will see again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I already told you that I love gambling. So betting my life like it's a chip is an easy thing to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Look at you making such a sweet face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>But I get it now. You really like gambling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>(And you really love people.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(People who truly love people from the bottom of their heart are...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Why are you laughing right now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I thought I didn't like gambling but seeing you has changed my opinion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Your gambling style is interesting. I want to see it from as close up as I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Really? I'm honored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>But if you want to see it up close, joining me in doing it is the best way. Don't you think so, Will?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Heh. You're right. You know what? Stirring up trouble with you might be good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>If it's with you, I think it'll be fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'm glad I met you.</td>
</tr>
