</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>
<td>What an irresponsible thing to say, right? But thanks to that, I had to become a brother she'd be proud of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/wilh.png" alt="Wilhelm" height="128"><br>Wilhelm</td>
<td>That's why you quit the Wratharis Army and started researching Alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>
<td>If her big brother becomes an Alchemy genius, that'll be something to be proud of, right?</td>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
