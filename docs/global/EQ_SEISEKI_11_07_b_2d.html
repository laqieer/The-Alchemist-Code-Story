</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Realized it was impossible...? Something terrible must have happened to make you lose hope so completely.</td>

<td>Bright flame... Lord Zahar is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>S-so then... What was left...for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>The one who took Zahar from this world, and so the one who turned your dream to ash...was me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You, girl... I must...apologize to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I...disgraced your father...with my actions. This is...the only path...to atonement...left for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I...will not...force another...to sully their blade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Wait! No! Please, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Live by the blade, die by the blade... This is the path I choose! This sword which has been at my side through it all... It now gives me a clear path forward!</td>

<td>Farewell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>That fool...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
