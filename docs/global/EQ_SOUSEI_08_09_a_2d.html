<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/bian.png" alt="Bianca" height="128"><br>Bianca</td>
<td>For the Creation to work, whosoever carries it out must bear the will of a Creator. They need enough resolve to destroy everything that is, so as to realize their vision of what might be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/bian.png" alt="Bianca" height="128"><br>Bianca</td>
<td>Nidhogg...was too kind. He could not ignore that decision. He could not overlook the sacrifice that would be required.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Moreover, the Shell of the World was under the protection of Ouroboros—the God who keeps destiny affixed.</td>

<td>Ouroboros...</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/bian.png" alt="Bianca" height="128"><br>Bianca</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/bian.png" alt="Bianca" height="128"><br>Bianca</td>
