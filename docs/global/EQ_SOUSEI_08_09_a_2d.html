<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Phew!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Those winds certainly aren't to be trifled with. This region's weather is harsh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's enough to seriously affect combat, even. If this is the norm for Superbia Belt, I feel bad for the people here. It can't be easy getting constantly battered like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My arrows sure can't do much in this, I'll tell you that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If you fight within Mesarthim's Area of Effect, my shield can block the winds for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I don't have the magil to keep it up forever, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There. That's the last of the monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I am in your debt, travelers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So, are you truly the leader of these lands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes, and of the Infinite Serpent. Does this surprise you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>In a word? Very, very much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What kind of leader begs his enemies for help?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hahaha. That is a loaded question, and one I'm afraid I cannot adequately answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>However, this was a very fortuitous situation for you, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That depends. Would you care to explain yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Of course, of course. But let's not stand and talk out here whilst the winds whip us. Come, I'll show you to a more comfortable location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Why don't we just talk inside the airship? There's plenty of shelter from the winds below deck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>My, you are all so guarded! It would behoove you to follow me, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Don't you wish to see the altar upon which the Ceremony of Creation will take place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So it's all true, then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Such a scary face! I trust that you are already aware of what the Ceremony entails.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But you are still curious about it, are you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>As thanks for saving me, I'd be happy to give you a tour. You'll be able to see the true heart of our organization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Bianca, if you'd please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Sure thing. Just a second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This...is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The foundation of the Ceremony of Creation. It is the true center of Superbia Belt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And proof of our sin, as the descendants of dragons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This is the Genesis Altar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The Genesis Altar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It looks an awful lot like the arboreal altar in Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The magil here is just as pure, too. This is indisputably the beating heart of this Belt Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So Gula Belt also has such an altar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It seems Nidhogg doesn't know when to quit either...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Simply that your precious Guardian Dragon, Nidhogg, was also unwilling to give up on the Ceremony of Creation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Lies and slander! How could our Guardian Dragon seek the same end as the Infinite Serpent?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>This man's words...may be true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>In order to seal Beelzebub, Nidhogg allegedly required a Vessel of Purification—Emmel. But did he really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>We've already seen countless attempts to control the Cursed Beasts without any such Vessel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Such as Icona's Valley of Siddim Protocol...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>And Quence's Space-Time Manipulation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>And Zafeiris' dragon technique as well, perhaps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I believe so. In each of those cases, the technique alone was ultimately not successful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>But each was still able to control the Beast to some degree, without a Vessel. And two of the wielders were human, no less!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's inconceivable to think that Nidhogg, before falling to corruption, wouldn't have enough power to do the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>In a way, he was the ruler of Gula Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>We had always lived under his protection. You see what I mean, Waginau, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Well, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I see it. Nidhogg most certainly had the power to control the Beast. Or, to expound upon that a bit further...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>He was the only dragonkin to have possessed such power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Which is why I had to destroy it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It was necessary in order to claim Gula Belt for my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I don't hear any signs of remorse in your voice, Zafeiris...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Because I bear none. I do not believe my actions were in the wrong. I merely chose the method most likely to produce the results I desired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You two get along surprisingly well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Putting all of that aside, if Nidhogg didn't require a Vessel of Purification to control the Cursed Beast, then he must've needed it for another reason altogether.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>One which we don't presently know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>The Ceremony of Creation is a secret art we developed for the express purpose of reviving the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It only stands to reason that the last living dragon, Nidhogg, would've done his best to dig his talons into that Ceremony and not let go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That doesn't change the fact that he failed, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That's the only reason Gula Belt still stands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yes, that's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>So there must be some issue with the Ceremony, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>And I don't think it has anything to do with the number of sacrifices. It's something more...fundamental than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Outstanding! Your deductive reasoning is exemplary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Though it's nothing new, I'm sure. You must have come to this conclusion long, long ago...Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>But you are correct. There is one single, glaring flaw that plagues the Ceremony of Creation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>The dragons never reached any sort of consensus on what kind of world they should create.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>No matter what spectacular tools they used or the breadth of materials they gathered, they had no future for which they yearned, and thus no plan upon which to move forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>That's why they entrusted humans with the Ceremony—the one species that never gave up on the idea of a better tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Bianca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Long time no see, Nimul. You seem well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>A girl! Nimul's getting close to another girl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I'll have to tell Emmel about this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Mira, we're kind of in the middle of a really serious conversation right now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>For the Creation to work, whosoever carries it out must bear the will of a Creator. They need enough resolve to destroy everything that is, so as to realize their vision of what might be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Nidhogg...was too kind. He could not ignore that decision. He could not overlook the sacrifice that would be required.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Moreover, the Shell of the World was under the protection of Ouroboros—the God who keeps destiny affixed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Ouroboros...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>But the yoke has been broken, and God is asleep. This world is now adrift, under the watchful eye...of no one. It is, in a very real sense, up for grabs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>And Nimul, because of this, it is possible to grant your wish...now, and only now. If the Ceremony of Creation is held at this very moment, its success is guaranteed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Absolutely not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>...That is the response I anticipated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I can't imagine anyone would be surprised by it. We've journeyed far and fought long and hard in order to save the people of every land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>We've rejected from the start, and will continue to reject, the idea that anything or anyone must be sacrificed in order to save the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I don't intend to remake anything. I intend to save it. All of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Very well, then. You leave us no choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I'm sorry that this must become a spectacle of force, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Nimul, this is not a good place for—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Everyone, stand down. This is my battle, and mine alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>But—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Let's do as he asks, Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Andechs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Things are all progressing a little too predictably—a little too easily. I smell a trap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Eulalia can clear away the corruption in the area if push comes to shove, but if she's interfered with, things could get rough. Can I count on you to watch her back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Brace yourself, Bianca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I will unlock this world!</td>
</tr>
