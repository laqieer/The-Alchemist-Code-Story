<td>All right, it's opening time. I hope I don't get any annoying customers today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey, Mister Weirdo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Urgh. So I get the most annoying one first. Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Mister Weirdo! Misterrrr Weirdoooooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't run in my shop, you little savage! And I'm not a weirdo, so stop calling me that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You make toys and play with your machines all year round. I bet you talk to the dolls when you get lonely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Your hat is funny-looking, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh? So that's what you think of me, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hey, Richie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Tch. Why do you drop the "Mister" as soon as you use my actual name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, um... Heheh. I, uh... D-do you have any fun toys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hmm? Ah, now that you mention it... Recently, I procured a game called shogi from Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's an interesting little game that requires wit and tactics. Speaking of which, what's that game you're always playing, again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You know the one I'm talking about. You fight with those strange little armored machines... Ah, Mech War Games! That's it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>M-Mech War Games?! I-I wasn't talking about that. This has nothing to do with Leema! It's not like I came here to talk to you about Mecha Lance, or—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're not much of a thinker. It would be a good way for you to study tactics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Anyway, so, uh, I...wanna mod my Mecha Lance! Yeah! That's it! I don't have a request or anything specific in mind...but yeah, if you could teach me how to service machines, that'd be really...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You're not listening to me at all, are you? What do you mean, "how to service machines"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You know, if you suddenly go quiet or avoid my eyes, it's a bit of a giveaway that you have something to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Please, Richie! I've been scoring really low in Mech War Games lately, and I ended up fighting with my mechanic, Leema!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>She services my gear for me so it's her fault, but she just won't accept it! She said that if I wasn't happy with her work then I should do it myself, 'cause maintenance doesn't do itself...or something like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>And I told her—I will do it myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>So I ran off and signed up for a tournament that's kinda like the Mech War Games held in Real Heaven! I'm competing all by myself, and that's why I need your help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(Hmph. Just when I think she's clammed up, she starts talking at a mile a minute.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So, please, you gotta teach me how to service machines! Please! I'm begging you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why?! I need to be the best, no matter what! I don't care if I have to do it alone—I'll do whatever it takes! I will be the strongest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(Hmph. This girl really is an insufferable little savage.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Customers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>More like...regulars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hello! I'm here to rob you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>He says he's here to rob you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's what we call a regular around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, then. If I get rid of these guys, you can thank me by teaching me how to service machines!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>H-hey! I'm not agreeing to anything!</td>
</tr>
