<td>Well well. Looks like we meet once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Are those Magitek Axemen working for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I guess you could say that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But they've stopped listening to me...which has proved to be somewhat problematic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...They've stopped listening to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>They went rogue and somehow ended up in this bizarre place. I've tried various means of escape with little success.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We're in the same boat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'd really like to be getting home. What about you, boys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm here to investigate the mysterious monsters that have been appearing around these parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>He's accompanying us as we believe our appearance here may somehow be related to that of the Magitek Axemen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So, you've joined forces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And the Magitek Axemen came with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Probably.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We're currently making our way to Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Been there done that. There was some sort of commotion going on there. Doubt it has anything to do with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Slothstein has nothing to do with this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Not as far as I could tell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(This isn't related to the power of the Sacred Stones...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It appears we've hit a dead end. Any other suggestions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>My investigation is based on the information I received regarding strange occurrences happening simultaneously within Slothstein and on the country border.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If it has nothing to do with Slothstein...then the only other alternative I can think of is Babel...or the Door of Truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Dude, another one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Something tells me it's not here on a diplomatic envoy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Is this also an Alkaroid from Slothstein?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It appears to be an upgrade from the last one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I won't go easy on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Don't get ahead of yourself.</td>
