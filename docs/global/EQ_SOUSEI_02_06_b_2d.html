<td>Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hmph. I let down my guard. I forgot myself, and now an attack has come while I am separated from Nimul and the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Perhaps I ought to make my way to Adaleigh's position, since they're closer. Or...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, you parried my attack. How unexpected. I was sure you wouldn't even notice me coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ugh. I thought this would be easy since you're all alone. What a pain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You...! Mira?! No...I'm sensing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>A Fallen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Who are you? Why do you look like those twins?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ugh. Let's just finish this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You will not answer? Then you leave me no choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I missed? No, she manipulated space in order to change my attack's trajectory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But it takes her a moment to prepare her attack. This is my chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This is so annoying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(What is this? How can she be so unconcerned?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No! It was a trap?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I commend you on your resilience, but aren't you tired of this already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I must...make...it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Tch. Too bad. I thought I'd pick some of you off now to make it easier for me later, but I guess it wasn't meant to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There's no more time, though. Asmodeus is calling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Calling to us to stop them, to kill them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Just the same thing, over and over... What a simpleton.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh, well. What can you do? That's the nature of the Cursed Beasts, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I-insect...beasts? Come...to save me? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And those Fallen... What in the world is going on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>For now, I must reunite with the others. Nimul, Emmel, please be safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Why are there so many of these little—?! There's no end to them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm running out of ammunition! How's it going over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Not good. They're weak, but there are so many of them... I cannot hold them back for much longer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yeah... They're completely focused on us, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Haven't you noticed? These ice beasts are only trying to attack us, not the townspeople.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Now that you mention it...you're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Why aren't the ice beasts going after anyone else? I mean, I'm kinda relieved, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It'll be easier to simply show you. Both of you, stand back. You're in the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hey, what? Rude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Aren't those the insect beasts we see outside of town all the time? But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No. Look, that one's larger than the other ones. It's colored differently as well. Perhaps it's their leader?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Fellow insects! This is the moment we have all been waiting for! Look sharp! Stand ready! It's time to protect our home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Aaahh... Aaaaaghh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Urg...ekk...keke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Eek! Keke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Keke! Eek kekekeke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I...uh...what? I think I just... What did I just see? What? Am I dreaming?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'd say it's more like you were just awakened from a dream of sorts. From the illusion of their human masks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It is a spell that Ambrosia cast to protect this town, where the insects live as humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What?! What are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I mean...think about it. If you'd come to this town without knowing any of this and saw such a huge gathering of insects, how would you react?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That's...uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I would think they were attacking the town...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But they aren't doing anything like that. They don't want to hurt anyone. All the insects want to do is live out their lives here in this village, as humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Now that you've spent some time with them, you can see that, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>So the Cursed Beast only wants humans. That is why the townspeople have always been safe, because they aren't actually human beings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Exactly. This place had been completely forgotten by the Cursed Beasts. It's like...insect paradise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Th-thank you so much... But...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Eek! Keke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I-I'm so sorry, I am not sure I understand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>In any case, they seem to have saved us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Waginau?! Oh, and...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Emmel! Whew! We've been looking for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Mira? Um, what is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Emmel, explanations can wait until later. First, let us find Yna and the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You three should get back to Ambrosia's place! I'll go by myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Don't worry, Nyx is with them, so I know exactly where they are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I'm going to jump right to them! Peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>She's gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hurry! We should make our way to the witch's home posthaste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Well, well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>My magil reserves are only at sixty percent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Tsk... After saving their lives and putting them up in my own home, the least they could have done for me was wait patiently until my preparations were complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Still, this is a chance that I cannot let slip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Prepare yourself, Asmodeus. This witch who has never known love will sing a requiem for your end!</td>
</tr>
