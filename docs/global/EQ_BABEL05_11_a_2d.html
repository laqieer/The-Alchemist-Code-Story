<td>The birthday I lost my parents...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What's your name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Cheryl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Your parents were researching sorcery in Slothstein. Do you have any thoughts about what they were doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Discontent with simply studying magic, they overreached by breaking the taboo on Alchemy to study the very foundations of magic itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Would you like to see your parents?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Your parents seemed to feel that they needed to understand the truth of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What do you think of that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I would say that it is foolish nonsense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Here I am again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The country of sloth, ever dependent upon the power of magic, the applied art of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>In this, my hateful homeland, I was never indolent. I knew only self-control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I recoiled from the things I loved, and instead took all that I loathed upon myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I was not a greedy child. I didn't ask for much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So long as I was good, my parents were always kind to me, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We never went on trips together as a family, or anything like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I suppose they had little time to spend with me. Looking back, I merely surmise that they must have enjoyed their work very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I never sought anything, yet still I lost so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The only thing I ever asked for was that we might stay together. I wished for nothing else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Helpless rage will inevitably morph into twisted hate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I knew this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yet, for the first time in my life, I began to desire something. I wished for it, over, and over, and over again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I wanted Alchemy to cease to exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Slothstein, Real Heaven - Lowest Level of the Slums</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Cheryl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I haven't seen you in a while, Courage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You could try contacting me once in a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Aren't you happy to see me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I didn't say you aren't welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>How are you getting along with Reagan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh! You have to hear this! I just mentioned that it's been so many years since father left, and do you know what he said to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>He said, "Knowing you, if you saw him again, you'd end up sobbing and burying your face in his chest."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Can you believe that?! I'm not talking to him right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmhm. It's good to see that nothing has changed around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hey! What's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Well, this is the fourth time you've told me this story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The sixth, actually. It's still bugging me, so there'll probably be a seventh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>May we come in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Sure. It's messy, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Anyway, shut up, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I haven't even said anything yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You need my help, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Well, no, I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Your face says it all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That's not really—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Spit it out already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You're the one who told me to shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>So what if I did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Courage, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Who is this, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Her name is Lofia. She's currently on the run, due to some...special circumstances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>And you are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>This is Courage. She is perhaps the most outstanding gunner in all of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Cheryl! Did you have to say it like that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>There's no need to be bashful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>There's nothing more embarrassing than when your family talks big about you in front of strangers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>F-family? W-well, that's... I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hah! Look who's blushing now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Are the two of you related?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>My parents used to take care of Courage, back when they were still in good health.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Yeah, right after my father disappeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hey, you! What do you think you're looking at? My eyes are up here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Wha—?! No! I wasn't...! I was just thinking that your outfit was really nice, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>See? I knew your eyes were wandering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>N-no, I really wasn't...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Oh, Nyx. You've gone all red. I'm surprised at you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>No, no, no! You've got it all wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I must say that I do not appreciate this behavior, Nyx. This is no way to treat one's host.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Will the three of you cut it out already?! I don't have time for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You've mentioned that, but your eyes were awfully busy just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I just couldn't help but notice how nice her clothes and accessories are, that's all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Huh? Really? Well, thanks, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Her outfit, huh? Yeah, right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Accessories, indeed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Oh, come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Look at him, trying to act all charming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I definitely caught his eyes lingering on several places where there are no accessories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>No fair! Don't gang up on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>These are all homemade. I use a special magical filament to run Alchemia through them and make them glow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Aren't they lovely?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Y-yeah... Super pretty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>(There are gadgets in this time that I've never seen before, and the people here wield Alchemia in ways I've never even heard of it being used.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>(Who knew you could use Alchemia for things like this?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>You can still feel a little buzz from the Alchemia when you touch them. Here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>O-oh, really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Just what is that hand of yours reaching for, Nyx?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>C-Courage! What do you think you're doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Huh? I-I was talking about my accessories, not me! The accessories!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Nyx! Nyx! Hey, Nyx!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>What do you want?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Why don't we step outside for a bit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Sure. J-just let me think in peace for a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>(I'm such an idiot!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>(What was I thinking?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>(I can't even think about touching anything under these circumstances!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Can we talk about something else now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Other than your work as a mercenary and the gunner competitions that sometimes take place in other countries, you are always home, are you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Well, you never know... Father might come back someday! Don't forget, I have those maintenance jobs from time to time, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Real Heaven is a slum city that you will not find on any map. It suits our purposes well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>In the extreme case that something should happen, however, Courage will protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>You want me to watch this kid, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I can protect myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Remind me, Courage... What is your daily training routine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Huh? I go up to the clock tower after every meal and scope out the town with my sniper rifle, three times a day. Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Wow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>What? You got something to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>You have to keep an eye out for your father, just in case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>You know it! I can't afford to miss him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>So if there happened to be someone suspicious near Lofia, here, would you notice them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Urgh! You're always lumping things on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>You would be doing me a big favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>That's what you always say!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>It would only be for a little while, as long as it takes for me to make the short trip to Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Then I'll come straight back here to see you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>You know, with Lofia here to mind the house in case of your father's return, you could even go outside of the slums to search for him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Consider my magic at your disposal. Just so you know, I can't make anything but dessert, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>It's fine. I have other options for a house-sitter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Other options...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>I suppose you just up and left without telling your friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I can't really talk about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>(She just left without telling them anything, huh?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>(Or maybe... She really couldn't talk about it, to them, either.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Fine. I'll do it. I might as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I don't really get what's going on, but once this is all over... Make sure you tell your friends about it, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>I'm sure they'd appreciate it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I will now present my account of what has occurred before the Holy Order. All of the evidence I need has been recorded in my monocle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>I expect that my investigation into the Holy Guard will progress much more quickly with the full might of the Inquisition behind it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Your unjust persecution, Lofia, should also be swiftly resolved. You will only have to hold on a little while longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I didn't think I'd get to see her...my friend...again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Thank you, Cheryl. You've done so much for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>There's no need for that. You are the one who made this possible, Lofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>In fact... You saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I refuse to live my life being controlled and used by those in power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Power must be controlled. I will be the one to keep it in check, and to pass judgment on those who would misuse it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Now, the opportunity to do so is upon me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>I must live long enough to see it done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>The Space-Time Manipulator!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>I can hear the ringing of a bell, and... Who is that speaking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Adrift in the sea of time, the pendulum stirs the depths of the waves. Gather where the light falls, so that I may see you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Wait, this is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Where the hell is this voice coming from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Sea floor and cerulean sky, woven and unfurled. Be it chance or be it fate, we are chased by dreams both infinite and finite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Mira?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Now, come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Ahhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Chance Encounter!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>What in the world?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Wh-where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Phantoms?! Wait, no, that can't be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Chance Encounter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>A space-time technique which, for a limited time, pulls together people who hold the same convictions from their separate times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Even people who have no idea what's going on? Isn't that kinda rude?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Well... It is somewhat random.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>It's a big help, either way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Nyx...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>What?! How do you know Nyx?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>No, you aren't Nyx at all. Where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>H-how did we get here? Just a second ago we were—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Grooooorrrgggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Ahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>What manner of...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>I have no idea what's going on, but they're not our enemies, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Probably not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Yo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>You wanna lend us a hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Who are you, anyway, old man? You're suspicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Heh. I'm not an old man. Call me Mister Will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Only an old man would want to be called "Mister".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>What?! The hell kinda logic is that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Besides, Will is an old man's name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Oh, is it now! Is that so? Hell no, that ain't so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Are those...Demonic Soldiers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Now how do you know that, pretty lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>P-pretty lady?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Yeah, you. Don't you like it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>W-we only just met!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Was I being too forward?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>N-no, not at all! I mean, I...! I will not penalize you for that nonsensical statement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Anyway, it doesn't really matter who you guys are right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>We don't have the strength to fight them at the moment, so would you mind doing us a favor and helping out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>To what end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Our survival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Y-your eyes are all red. Have you been crying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Someone very important to me just passed away. I want to live on, for their sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>So, please... Please help us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Very well. I accept your request as reasonable and just.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Cheryl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>I need no reason to execute these disgusting products of Alchemy, believe you me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Moreover, by fighting beside these people, who are only trying to survive, and by experiencing this other time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Perhaps we can find out why.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Why...you were killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Maybe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>Don't cry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>I want to keep on living, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Just like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>Th-thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>Magnus...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>I'll be back soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>The same...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>She said that this technique pulls together people who hold the same convictions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>I suppose she did, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Which means that we must share some convictions with them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>As well as with each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>Perhaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>I've been wishing for something...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>Even though I know in my heart of hearts that it will never come true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>I just can't help but want to see her again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>I accept your request as reasonable and just.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>Hahah. Why are you acting all high-and-mighty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>You do realize that I am an inquisitor...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>Yes, but you're a lenient one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>Only on those who are closest to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>Let's have tea together later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>Very well. Perhaps we might have something spicy for now, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>Where do you keep all those pickles, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>Would you like some?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>Hmmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>Yes, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>Hmhm. Here you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240</td>
<td>Umgf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>241</td>
<td>Oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>242</td>
<td>How are they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>243</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>244</td>
<td>They're not spicy anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>245</td>
<td>Boot up, Campanella!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>246</td>
<td>It's so bright! Is this...Alchemy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>247</td>
<td>It's so pretty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>248</td>
<td>Father, mother, Magnus... Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>249</td>
<td>It's family vacation time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>250</td>
<td>Grrrroooooorrgghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>251</td>
<td>Ah, this is the true pleasure of traveling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>252</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>253</td>
<td>Nothing beats raising hell with the people you meet along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>254</td>
<td>Well, we're not strangers anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>255</td>
<td>It's like a picnic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>256</td>
<td>Like going out together as a family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>257</td>
<td>I guess that makes us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>258</td>
<td>Lofia...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>259</td>
<td>Something like a family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>260</td>
<td>You're lenient on those you're closest to, right, Cheryl?</td>
