<td>Ack... The Jam's corruption has reached as far as Asena's fountain. I wonder if Asena is safe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Is this the place?! What a beautiful fountain... I've heard the stories, but I never expected it to be this beautiful!</td>

<td>O great Godwolfâ€”</td>

<td>Pleased to meet you. I never expected you to be so divine... What's the matter, Tina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Nothing...it's just that something appears to be different from the last ritual. Something appears to wrong...but what is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What the...?! What's happening?!</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ack...! Mocca!</td>

<td>Tina...my beloved daughter...it's been a while. Have you been well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Fa-father...?! Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...Have you lost weight? You must be pushing yourself too hard. Ever since you were small, you always tried to shoulder too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Come over here. Let me hear your voice. Come now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...Father!</td>

<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm coming to you now...father.</td>

<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Even if you walk away...I am sure someone else will handle this task. Now...it is time for you to rest!</td>

<td>It's impossible for you to shoulder all of Saga on your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...Huh? Father...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Leave the future of Saga to someone else...and let us rest now, Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...No. My father would never say "it's impossible" or "leave the future of Saga to someone else!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...Hyaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Tina!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That was not...what my father wanted! My father entrusted the future of Saga to us... That's why...that's why I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I will overcome everything that stands in my way in order to fulfill his wish! ...Reveal yourself! I will not have you insult the memory of my father any further!</td>
