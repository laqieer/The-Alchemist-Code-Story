<td>Oh, that's odd. Your soul...it's separated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Who are you? I'm...Tyrfing. My memory is a little foggy.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Where is this place?</td>

<td>005</td>
<td>I am Ouroboros...the observer of destiny who bonds this world with truth.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is the Door of Truth.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hmm. I see. Within your body, I can feel your soul glimmer with something that is different from Alchemia. Are you a warrior from another world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Glimmering inside my body...? Are you talking about my Killium?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Killium? What is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, nothing... The word just fell out of my lips.</td>
</tr>

<td>The name doesn't matter. Its glimmer is the key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>My memory is hazy, but I can feel it in my bones: this world isn't mine.</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What should I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I can see in your soul the light of a warrior. Perhaps there are things you will understand through fighting?</td>

<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh! I'm Killer Princess. Yes. That's what I thought! I need a commander in order to fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I guess I should search for a commander...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You must find the answer to that yourself. I will observe your glimmering soul.</td>
