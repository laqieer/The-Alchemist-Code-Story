<td>Yeah, you're looking good. Nutrition levels are also fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You're free to walk around outside now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes! Thank you, Miss Malta!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh, but don't go overboard, okay? It hasn't been long since you came to our village, and injuries are bound to happen in an unfamiliar place, Hisham.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Aw, but I'm not stupid! I can take care of myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm sure you can, but you just recovered. Don't ruin it and rest up, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Okaaaay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Very good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Kamui and Isidore should be back from their Spiritbonding training soon. Let's get ready for lunch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What about you, Miss Malta? You don't need to go train?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I was just wondering. I mean, I thought it was like a big deal or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That Spirit-something whatever? Isn't it the duty of the people of this village to train?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, well, you know quite a lot, don't you? Did Kamui tell you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Don't you worry! No matter how much they train, I'm still the best Spiritbonder in the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What? No way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No joke. When it comes to Spiritbonding, not even Kamui is a match for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Really? Are you exaggerating?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What's with that suspicious look? You don't believe me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, I've seen what Kamui can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You know he can blow up a bunch of beasts in a flash? Like boom! Kablam!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>There can't be that many people who can do what he can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm just saying, Miss Malta, you don't really look that strong. Weren't you the one just telling me not to overdo it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(I'm kind of offended that this is how Hisham sees me!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(Even though I'm the oldest and smartest, and therefore the most deserving of respect! Hm... I know!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Fine, fine. Then I'll prove it to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey! Hisham, we're back! I hope you've been behaving yourself—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Both of you, get ready right now! I'm going on patrol with the two of you today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>C'mon, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Don't worry, Hisham. There's nothing to fear when you're with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ah, uh... Okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hisham, what's going on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Uh... I don't really know. She just got really fired up for some reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Something about being best Spiritbonder in the village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Malta is pretty competitive...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm sure she hates anyone thinking she's not the best in her own field of expertise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I mean... I appreciate the help, but to waste her talents on beast patrol? That seems like a little much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wait, what? Is Malta actually really strong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well, you'll see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You can run...but you can't hide, not from me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Gyarr?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wh-where is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>She sensed the Alchemia of the beast, most likely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Even you didn't sense it, Kamui? We're really outclassed here... We'd better train more...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Seriously?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The time of daylight is our blessing; time quickens, allows us the provision of this time and place—</td>
