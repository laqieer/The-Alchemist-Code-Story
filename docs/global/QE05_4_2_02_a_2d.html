<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>You're with the Holy Guard?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes, I stand as the Captain of the Holy Guard's 4th Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why would you do something like that?! You should know that they're the ones plotting foul deeds in the shadows of history!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Of course I know! You see... I, too, am involved in those machinations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What did you just say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I am a member of Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Dias! How could you join Corpse?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>They're the ones that caused the ruin of Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That is exactly why I joined them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Logi, this world is crooked. Good deeds bear no fruit while evil laughs from the shadows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>To rectify this truth, to change this sad world, we need power. We need unstoppable, absolute power in order to uphold order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I will become the Lord Commander! Everything I am, everything upon which I stand, guides me toward that single purpose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Logi, my hands are already stained red with blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I've championed my own justice and decreed others to be evil. I have trampled over countless dreams and wishes. I can no longer turn back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Which is exactly why I am the one who can—no, the one who must—change this world! I will restructure this system of life that perpetually gives birth to sorrow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Take Agatha and get out of here, Logi. Go to Saga or Wadatsumi... Wherever Northern Pride's influence is at its weakest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Please... Wait for me there. Wait for me to change this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I will remake this world into a place where the you two of you can live without fear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You know we both want the same thing for Agatha. We both want to protect—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No... No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I can't do that! I, too, have ambitions! Things I've sworn to myself that I will protect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I have comrades who have followed me all the way here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>How could I possibly run now, knowing that I'd be leaving them all behind?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I suppose you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Somehow, I knew that that would be your response.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Which is why I must do what is necessary to end your career as a warrior!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Nngh! Th-this is just like when—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Do not be so foolish as to assume that my powers are the same as they were before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The Holy Guard has taught me all about the power of Alchemy! The art of harnessing the strength of this power is ingrained within my very being!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>This is where your journey ends, Logi! Leave your regrets and bloodshed with me! I will bear them all in your stead, forevermore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That is not for you to decide, Dias!</td>
