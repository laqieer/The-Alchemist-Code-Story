<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>You are such a glutton, Ephylinde.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's been a long time since I've had such an appetite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So you have not had nightmares since?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>None. Does that mean that Your Highness has not as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>None. I sleep very well every night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I no longer mindlessly sit at the breakfast table after a night of insomnia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>A feast so fragrant you can taste it, so beautiful the sight of it fills you up! Such luxury!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Not to mention...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Good food is best with good company.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Heheheh! Truly? Heheheh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I feel as though I can eat forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There is more where that came from, but don't you forget your manners, Ephylinde.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Be sure to finish everything on the plate. And try not to spill anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(Pure and noble. And therefore easily corrupted. I remembered that high elves were such people.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hehe, I will. Thank you for the meal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I will be your tutor regarding life in the royal palace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(Their purity draws corruption in and makes them stand out. A target that is easy to pervert.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I declare to you all, my beloved people! Oh, wait. This is your Princess Ainanna speaking. I declare!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This is about the future of our village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Our village of Fairgreen has long avoided the inclusion of other races.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(A country deprived of diversity.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That is the method we chose to ensure our longevity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(Like rotting food or an infectious virus, when filth and contagion invades a host...they cause decay and deterioration.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I believed the absolute eradication of what might corrupt us was my responsibility. I believed this was the one true way to protect our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That is what I believed. You most likely believed the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(And that is why the high elves of this country never developed tolerance for others and believed that any change would cause their life spans to be reduced.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(Having grown extremely frail and sensitive, they established a village in snowy lands to reduce the deterioration and effects of corruption, even by a little.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(As a high elf who left the village... I'm... Far more than you, I...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But rather than spending eternity disparaging others in the midst of my own loneliness, I want to welcome the teachings of the outside world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(But you... You dreamed my dreams and wanted to know more.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's the kind of country I want ours to be: one in which we are able to live alongside even dark elves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(Surely you know it too, though, Your Highness... That that's all it can ever be. A dream.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(The rejection of outsiders has been ingrained over hundreds, thousands of years.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Even if I am merely chasing a phantom dream alongside my people, I want to try and make it a reality, no matter how long it takes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(There's no way a culture so hardened and set in its ways can change so easily!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Long live Princess Ainanna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Long live Princess Ainanna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>How...can this be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We stand behind Princess Ainanna! We stand with Princess Ainanna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The princess protected our village! This village has no future without our princess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ainanna... Your Highness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Long live Princess Ainanna! Long live Princess Ainanna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh... I feel strangely...shy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Princess Ainanna... I loathe to ask this, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I would never cast an illusion on my old friends of this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...I see. I am ashamed to have doubted you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(Those beliefs were not the only thing to have been cultivated over these long years.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I know that not everyone will support this, but I will devote all of my time and effort to convincing the rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Your Highness... You...have...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(This response is only possible because you've earned the people's trust.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh? Do I sense incoming praise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(From this smile of yours to the words you've exchanged with the people... Everything you do is designed to conceal your exhaustion and hide it from us.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Of course. The highest of praise. You deserve it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Eheh... Heheheheh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>(In that case, I, too...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hm?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Princess Ainanna... Please, excuse me for a time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Ephylinde?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>(Letitia... Letitia...?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Letitia! Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Haa...haa... Letitia, can you hear me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You can, can't you? You're enjoying this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>This is it... The day I laugh alongside you, at last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I've dreamed of this day! We just might see the birth of a land where we can live in peace and laughter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Right, Letitia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I sense joy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>This is the springtime of our world, Ephylinde.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>The light scents wafting about the village, the cheerful voices of the people, the sound of light footfalls...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Humans, dark elves, and high elves interacting freely... It's not chaotic, but it is a lively and productive scene!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You have done well, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Haven't I? I've done very well, haven't I!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Indeed. Far more so than I ever could have... There is nothing more I can teach you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>No. There is so much more I want to learn from you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Be that as it may...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Have you tired of me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I could never.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Truly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>From the bottom of my heart, I am grateful to have returned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Then will you stay by my side, always?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Are you sure? Always is a long time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>As sure as can be. Always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Then will you join me in my bed tonight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Wh-what? Certainly not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Was that too greedy of me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>G-greedy... Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I wish to have no more nightmares.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>But if I must have nightmares, I will not be afraid if you are with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Your Highness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I'm exhausted from my work... I will not be so selfish as to ask you to sleep in my bed, but I ask that you sleep near me if you will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>It... It wouldn't be proper...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>No one is watching or listening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Please sleep with me and don't leave my side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I cannot stand to be alone in sleep. Only then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>That night, the village was accosted by a blizzard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>A village which had only ever known clear skies was suddenly enshrouded in dark clouds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Despite the whirling snow and the winds whipping against the palace walls...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>...the ominous sounds did not reach our ears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>We slept deeply, embraced by the comforting, sweet-scented bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I had never slept so soundly as I did that night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Good night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Good night, Your Highness. What time shall we wake tomorrow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>A good question...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>It was a night engraved with the most wonderful of dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Let us sleep until we wake of our own accord.</td>
</tr>
