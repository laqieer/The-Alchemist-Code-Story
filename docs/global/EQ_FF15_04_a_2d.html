<td>This is the King's Stew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...It's delicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(A hand cooked stew... How nostalgic.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Heh. Who knew you could loosen up like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Eat your vegetables, Noct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...I seriously don't think this monster grass is edible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If you're not gonna eat it, I can eat it for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...Fine, fine. I'll eat it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That being said, the monsters we encountered earlier were a breed that I'm completely unfamiliar with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Likewise, I've also never seen the monsters and soldiers we've just fought here either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, the world's a large place. Our two worlds may be connected in unexpected places.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>One can hope so. I would like to return as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh, come on! I can't connect to King's Knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're way too addicted to that game.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I won't be able to get my consecutive login bonus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I can't connect with mine either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>May I ask what that is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This? Umm. I'm not sure how to explain it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's a communication device...or was. In its current state, it's pretty much just a box.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Isn't there a better way to explain it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Never mind that. Look at the sky. It's the same as our sky in Lucis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It differs drastically from Crown City.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh! I wanna go home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(I wonder how long it's been since I spent a night like this with others.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, look who woke up on the wrong side of the bed again this morning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Let's quickly depart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yeah, let's hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Love to do that, but it looks like we've got company.</td>
