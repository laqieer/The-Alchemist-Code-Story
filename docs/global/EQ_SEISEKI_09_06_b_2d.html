</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No matter how strong a foe, there's always a weakness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huzaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Idiot. Your lightweight sword won't even scratch me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Agh...gh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Basheeny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ugh...ghh! I...I'm not down yet! Ca-Captain Monzein wouldn't give up here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's right...you said that you inherited Monzein's soul, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If that's the case, then I'll use my arm to obliterate both you and that soul of his!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Arm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What was I thinking? I was so blown away by that tremendous arm of his that I was completely taken aback...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...Huzahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hey, Hero of Lost Blue...what're you gonna try this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I thought I'd follow in the footsteps of the old man for once. Let's face each other head on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Sorry, but Basheeny's been entrusted with the future by the old man. I won't let you hurt him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That proud arm of yours or my technique...let's see which one wins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Captain Othima!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You're hilarious. If that's you want...then I'll eradicate you with my fist!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yeah, you're fast... If I miss this attack, I guess you can call it over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This is to help Basheeny as well...old man, lend me your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Dieeeee!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ill Atmosphere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Captain Othima!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Heh... That's unfortunate. Before you could show off that little technique of yours...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Agh... N-no...in fact, I did show off my technique...to its maximum degree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...! What the...?! What's this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You...froze his legs?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I concentrated it just at your legs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Sorry, but that ice...you won't easily break it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ugh...! You scum! What're you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I-I was too taken aback by the tremendous strength of your arm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>After thinking about it, I finally realized that's not where your strongest weapon is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The thing that was harming us the most was your side-to-side movement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well then...now that you can't move around...what're you going to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Captain Othima...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Honestly...your jaw looks stupid. I'll leave the rest to you, Basheeny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Even with my lightweight sword...if you can't move your body, I think I can inflict some level of damage on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wouldn't you agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You don't get to do whatever you please anymore! Take this...Quad-Assault!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Tsk...fine... At least I fulfilled my role as a distraction to buy time. Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>?! He disappeared?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Looks like he reached out for that forbidden area of Veda. I guess it wasn't a lie after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>When I fought with a young girl called Acht in Lustburg...she disappeared along with the magic she cast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I was wondering what kind of trick it was...but, if he was telling the truth, then that explains everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Most likely, they have the ability to go back and forth between another dimension...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>In case of an emergency evacuation or when things go wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>This must be that guy called Sol's doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Another dimension?! Are you serious?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>The fact that he disappeared without a trace is more evidence than anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Their inhuman power and their god-like appearance...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It seems like little by little we're revealing their secrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Captain Othima! The soldiers have broken through the barrier! Currently, they are engaged in conflict with the Greed soldiers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Are things all right over here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yeah, somehow. Although...I did get some help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Ah, nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Well then, let's quickly finish off the Greed Dike soldiers. Then we've got to hurry to Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Huh? Saga? Not Northern Pride?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Ah. That guy Neun was trying to make us go to Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I mean, you saw his wooden performance, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Are you saying that they're trying to keep us away from Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>In other words...Orion and the main Greed Dike army...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Most likely, they're in Saga. Our status report to Northern Pride...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Understood. Leave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Thanks. Whatever is going on, attacking Greed Dike's army is our priority. Are you ready to go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I never thought I'd be able to approach and close in on someone moving at such a fast velocity as he could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>He really saved me out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Old man Monzein lent me a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Well, I guess that makes up for the lunch he owed me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What? What is with this wind? I've never felt such an ill-willed wind before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>What does it mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I'm not sure...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Commander Kanon! I bring bad news! They've breached the border!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>At the same time, it appears that numerous fires have started in the city below!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>The wind is fanning the flames causing the fire to spread throughout the city!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>That's not it...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>The wind is what's causing the flames! Its heat is what is setting fire to the city!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>The wind is causing the fire?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Reporting! The castle has been infiltrated!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What?! In such a short period of time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Ugh..?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>We're under fire! Get back, Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I-it's dangerous here! Please run...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>No...! How can so much devastation be caused in such a short amount of time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Th-there's no way we can win against an enemy with such attacking force...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>...?! Run, Kanon!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>!!! Ka...Ka...non...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Agh...ahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Ah...ack! Ugh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Kanon...!!!</td>
