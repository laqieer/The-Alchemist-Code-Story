<td>Found her! She's over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>S-stay away...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You're making this so much harder than it has to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Stop dilly-dallying! Grab her already, and stuff her in the carriage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No! Get back! Stop! Get off me!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Noooooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Not again! I keep having the same dream lately. Nngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh? Wait, what time is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh no! I need to hurry, or I'll be late!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ines? It's about time. Is everything taken care of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Whoa! You're already here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No time to lose, then! I should be fine dressed like this. First, we need to get the festival items all sorted...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I believe they're all in...this bag, yes! Gotta take special care setting them up, though. We don't want to disrespect any traditions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Um... First is the staff, then the crown, the bracelet...then incense, I think? After that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>After that is my charm, official or no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ines? Aren't you finished yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sure am! Be right there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You're late. And you still have bedhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Honestly... A proud high elf such as yourself should always keep up appearances. How many times must I tell you that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Maybe just don't? It's really no big deal. I'll go wet my hair. That'll fix it right up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Dear me. I thought taking over as festival representative might've made you more...cognizant of your demeanor. But I seem to have been mistaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You will be representing us high elves—the most elite of elite in this world—to the humans. A disheveled appearance is plainly unacceptable. What's more—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Look, I get it! All I need to do is fix it and we're good, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You haven't time to fix anything! Our human guide will be arriving at any moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What? Already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>For her to even be allowed into this forest, I guess she really must be from a family line blessed by the high elves. It's hard to imagine a human here, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's correct. Under ordinary circumstances, no human would ever be permitted to enter our sacred forest at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But our predecessors allowed them access so as not to see our past conflicts resurface. It was a compromise of necessity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It's for that reason that we must treat these humans with respect and acceptance. That being said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I feel a disturbance in the forest's Alchemia. The animals are restless, and it is no doubt due to the unwelcome presence of humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>One must wonder if something as droll as a festival can even bring true peace in the first place. It's only been a few hundred years, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Don't talk like that! This festival is really important for our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's our chance to join hands with the humans and ask the spirits to bless us all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's...what my mother always told me, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's why she entrusted me with this position. So I could make sure our relationship with them stays strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>So yes, I'm well aware how important all of this is. And I'm going to go into it with my best foot forward. For our people, and as my mother's successor, I promise you:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I will uphold the cordial relationship we have with the humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Well said. This festival is crucial for the high elves. The pact we've made ensures our forest's continued safety. You seem to fully understand that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And that's wonderful to see. Reducing threats to our livelihood is of paramount importance indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I suppose what truly concerns me, however, is not whether you understand the gravity of the event, but...if you're personally okay with it all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What do you mean? Okay with what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>As our representative, you will be forced to deal with many humans. And you will have to do so impartially. I'm asking if you feel you can manage that task.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm sure you must still be having that same dream, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ever since you were almost kidnapped by those humans, you haven't quite been yourself. It's hard not to have some concerns—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'm fine! Really. That was a long time ago. Trust me, I'm okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Very well. Pay me no mind, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(I do still worry whether her past may affect the blessing of the spirits, though...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Just...promise me one thing. If the spirits are upset in any way, it could disrupt the festival. So if anything should happen, I'd ask that you please inform me immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Of course. Thank you, Nasario.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh? Well, hello there! It's a rare treat to see you little ones in the high elf forest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Careful, Ines. Something's not right here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Nununu, numa!</td>
