<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh? Ah, you again, little lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The strange man from some time ago...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Now that we've met again, it looks like I have to believe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I guess the so-called fate you mentioned before is real!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I heard you lament your regret at not being able to save others. Have you decided now to seek power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>My regret at not being able to save others...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ah, of course! Alvarez! Tsk. Now isn't the time for this! Sorry, can you quickly send me back to where I just came from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Even if you returned, what would change? Were you not seeking power to escape your dilemma?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...Don't need it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If I were to ask for help here, I'd be no different than that loser Alvarez.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Right now, I've gotta fight with the power I have within me, or else it's pointless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hm. So it was a waste of your time to come here then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No. I believe in your power. It's enough that I was able to return to this starting point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If my power isn't ultimately enough, then...I'll call it a day and come back here to chill.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Agh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ugahh... Is this...my limit?!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I can't even move my hands or my legs...kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hmph. Either way, humanity is already on its path to destruction. There's no need to rush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I-I'm a...knight. At least...let me meet my end in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Your code of chivalry, is it? Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Uck. Y-you know, on second thought, unlike him...I'm not a very good liar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What...?</td>

<td>Whohhhh!!!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ack... Al-Alvarez! I've completely grasped your moves! Bubabab!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Your existence is pretty much a natural disaster! This fighting spirit that I've accumulated for over 20 years...I'm going to pump it all into you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>N-n-now is the time of release! Hwo-ooahhh!!! Br-br-brace yourself for the full force of m-m-my soul!!!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Bubababa!!! Y-you! I-I-I'll never forgive you for this!!! Bababab!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You don't have to. Just aim all of the power you have into this pulse of light on the ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Huhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What's that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Anyway, I'll leave this to you, Tara baby!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Wa-wa-wait!!! Bubababa!!!</td>
