<td>Heh. That's some big talk. Might wanna save your breath, though. Your breathing's a little ragged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Nngh! Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You did pretty damn well for just one man. No idea what made you try so hard against hopeless odds, but it's all over now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Good night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What made me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I wanted to protect that which is important to me. I wanted to carry out my oath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That much should be obvious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So what is with all these...feelings?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And why does your face come to mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>D-don't just...lie there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No! Don't youâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Snap out of it! You're being so stupid, Gerald.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>How many years have I stood by your side? You might not realize it yourself, but it's clear as day to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I can see right into your mind. "Vettel would do better." "Vettel is already way ahead of me."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Those are the kinds of useless, unproductive things you're dwelling on right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Is Vettel all you care about?! Are you so consumed with him that there's no room in your heart for me? We swore that oath together, didn't we? The three of us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Gerald, you're such a fool. That foolishness is exactly why you should be holding your ground!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You idiot... You've got to prove that the path you chose is the most righteous one! Force your opposition to believe in you with the sheer power of your will! I know you can do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>N-Natalie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Nngh... Getting mad makes your blood pump faster. I...forgot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I suppose that...makes me a fool, too. A fool who decided...to prop up...another fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Natalie! Hang in there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You are not alone, Gerald. I am here, and all of the Scarlet Legion are with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If you still don't understand, then...I'll have to dissect you after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>We're all...here...for you. Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Natalie! Natalie, wake up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Damn it! Look at them all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Natalie! Brother Gerald! Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wh-what are you all doing here? I never...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>When we couldn't find you anywhere, we feared the worst... I'm just glad we made it in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Why didn't you tell us what you were planning? You're always charging recklessly into things. Why don't you ever ask us for help?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I mean, we might not be as strong as you, but we're all members of the Scarlet Legion, aren't we? Which means we're all in this together! Let us help you, Brother Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We're not letting these bandit scum win! You got that?! Our captain is counting on us! We're all going to live another day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Show them what it means to be a part of the Scarlet Legion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>All of you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I've been watching others, preoccupied with what they are achieving instead of what I am doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>But that wasn't what he tried to teach me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Having something to protect is what will make you strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>For example, what I want to protect in this world is you. You and your mother. That is what centers me. It gives me the willpower I need to fight to protect everything, as a knight should.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>So, ask yourself. What is it you want to protect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>What was my answer back then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Here, we swear that our iron will shall stand indomitable in the face of hardship in order to ensure the joy and laughter of the people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What am I fighting for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Is it not to protect that which is important to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Ask yourself this: what do I want to protect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What am I doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The bonds I have worked so hard to forge, the friends I have made... Are they not plain before me now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Denying the path that I have walked...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>That would mean denying those very bonds. My own friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I won't let that happen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What is it I want to protect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The answer is clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>And now that I know it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>All that's left is to defend it by sheer force of will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>For that is the knight my father taught me to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hah... Bwahahahah! What's happened to your fangs, Legion dogs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Brother Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hmph. It's all the same to me if another dog joins the pack. Get him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Hahahahahah! Skewered like a pig on a stick! Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You...dog!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Like I said. Nothing's more effective than a frontal assault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Brother Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Don't worry. My injuries aren't fatal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Your captain's not going down that easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Understood, Brother Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Nnrgh... You're still outnumbered, dogs! You can't win!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Oh, yes we can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I forgot myself for a while there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>But thankfully, I have friends, good friends, to help me remember who I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>For their sake...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>From this point onward, it will no longer be just my willpower or my faith...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>But my very being, my heart, the blood running through my veins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>All of it will become as steel, glittering for all to see!</td>
</tr>
