<td>One day, I stumbled across a girl surrounded by a group of men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>They were ganging up on her, claiming that she had bumped into them. She was just a little girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>At the time, I wasn't accustomed to fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'd never fought against so many people, let alone those who were far bigger and stronger than myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Still, I couldn't leave the girl alone there. She was crying... My body moved on its own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You've gotta run! Quickly! I'll take care of things here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It'll be all right. There's no way I'll lose to a bunch of losers like these chumps!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ooh, you're a plucky one! Don't think we'll go easy on you just cause you're a girl, though. Get her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>They all rushed me at once...and then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Aaaaarrghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>H-huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hush, now. We'll talk after the battle! For now...sit back, and behold the splendor of my battle fury!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>U-um...! Th-thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I don't need thanks. I merely acted in reverence of the beauty of your spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The odds were against you, but did you care? Bah! You stood your ground when others would have turned tail and fled...and it was beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Not to mention that outfit! Radiant! Do you always fight in such garb?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Um, no... I've got a uniform that I wear in the dojo. I kinda have to wear it, or the old masters won't let me hear the end of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I really wish I could dress up like this in the dojo, too, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But they said that cuteness and martial arts don't mix, that it'd get in the way, that it's just a silly fancy I'll have to let go of if I ever want to succeed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Really, now? I must say that I wholeheartedly disagree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>After all, look at me! Am I not equally strong and beautiful? Are these qualities not in perfect harmony within me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Y-you're right! You're totally harmonized!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You see? Those who possess beauty and strength in equal measure are stars, my dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Strength and beauty... I don't have to choose! I get it! I guess you must be a star, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I suppose so. My country's people certainly seem to think so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Um... Do you think strength and cuteness would also work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh? Well... I don't see why not. Yes, I think you're onto something there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Th-then...! I wanna master it, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I wanna be both cute and strong! I wanna be a star!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Right... In that case, I shall be your very first fan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Even when alone, so long as someone is there to see you shine, you're a star!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Now, keep that chin up! Be proud of your starry shine! For, one day, you'll find your very own glow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You got it, Mistress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I see... So that is the reason why you so value strength and cuteness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>My dream is to totally master cuteness itself! Both my dad and my grandpa were against it, but Mistress Laila talked to them for me, and brought them around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>She said that strength and beauty are both things that improve the self, and that cuteness is no different! She told me that there's no way it'd go wrong, 'cause she'd teach me herself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>She had to apply a little pressure towards the end, though... But so what? She taught me that I have the potential to harmonize my strength and cuteness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>This Fan Club Event is a huge milestone on the path along which she led me! That's why I've gotta make sure it's a huge success, no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I understand, and having heard that wonderful story, I am more compelled than ever to make certain that this event goes off without a hitch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Now, then... If you would be so kind as to let me have a look at that program... Right, first of all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>First up is the Extreme Long Distance Forest Run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Don't "Aww" me! Shayna made this program just for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Not that I don't understand how you feel! But isn't it her hot-blooded streak—contrary as it may be to her adorableness—that makes Shayna so charming?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yeah, I guess that is one of the things that makes Shaynie so darn cute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Well I, for one, can totally get behind this complex foldout part of the guidebook she gave us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What about you? I believe this is the first time we've met...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I can't deny it; I'm a fan of her looks. She's adorable as a kitten, and strong as a mountain lion, to boot! I can't get enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Really? That's what you choose to bring up? Plebeian.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>We all know that she is equally adorable and powerful. Please... This is why I can't stand newbies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>H-hey! What's wrong with what I said?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Have a look at this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Your Fan Club Membership Card? What about it, huh?! W-wait a second... 005! You're number five?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hah! Not only that... Behold! The Fan Club Monthly Bulletin, first edition! They used to be handwritten by her, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I also have this! One of the dumbbells, complete with Shayna's voice, that were given only to those Fan Club Members with single-digit membership numbers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Cuteness is justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Whoa! Sweet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hmph. Now do you understand? I love Shayna the most, out of anyone here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Tch... I don't have a dumbbell! I didn't even know they existed, goddamnit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I've heard that Sir Alfred has even had the supreme pleasure of fighting alongside our Lady Shayna herself! Ooohh! The very thought is making me weak at the knees!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Heheheh. Well! Let me just say this; no one has witnessed Shayna's gorgeous legwork from quarters as close as I!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>To this day, the memory of her sweet smile...her elegant movements... Ahhh... How they warm my heart. Truly, they do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Oh, this is just hideous. Fans squabbling over their petty achievements... How vile!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What?! Who goes there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Membership numbers, old merchandise... You've done nothing but proven yourself to be fools who are trapped in the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What you flaunt as love for Shayna is nothing more than narcissism! It is really disrespectful of you; even now, she thinks only of your enjoyment of this event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Preposterous! No man loves Shayna more than I!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I will not stand for anyone, even a lady such as yourself, saying otherwise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>If you feel that strongly about it, then prove it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>P-prove it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Why, yes. If you claim to be her fan, then you ought to have a measure of both strength and beauty within you. Are you quite ready? Here I go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What?! But—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Domination! Victory! Bear witness to my Beautiful Revolution!</td>
</tr>
