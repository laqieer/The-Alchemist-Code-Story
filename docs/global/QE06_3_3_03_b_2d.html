<tr>

<td>That should just about take care of the Hidden Ogre menace out here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Shall we find Judius, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke, what's the situation?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Amane? What's going on? Where's Judius?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Headquarters...is collapsing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Only the commanding officers of the Blade Fox should be aware of this mechanism. Who is responsible for activating it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I think we're missing a few crucial details here. Care to fill us in on what happened in there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Jubei. Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>She's...trying to save us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm all too familiar with her methods. Always the same: wantonly acting upon her whims, without a word of explanation to anyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Stop. Do you intend to forfeit your position and leave the corps, without so much as a farewell?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I've broken the rules. There's nothing I can say to change that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I don't believe you'd do anything of the sort without adequate cause. I suspect you had your reasons, and I'd like to hear them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The facts are the facts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Jubei!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I don't know how things will turn out in the end, but there is one thing I'd like to say to you before I go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And what's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Just that you needn't bear alone all the burdens you've packed upon yourself—not the resentment, nor the anger, nor even the Black Star. Things may look bleak now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But someday, I hope you'll be able to settle down and read your books undisturbed. Never stop moving forward, sword in hand, until the day everyone in Wadatsumi can know such peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Farewell, my young pupil. If fate wills it, we'll meet again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...That infuriating woman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Celis and Jubei alike are just far too impulsive, always doing whatever they think needs to be done, without saying a word to anyone else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Without so much as a nod to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's really been eating at you, hasn't it? That's why you've been so uppity all this time. You just wanted to see Jubei again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Is that a fact?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You're mistaken. I just decided long ago that if ever I did see her again...I'd thump her thick skull.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You're not fooling anybody.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Reminiscing aside, our next move is unclear. How should we proceed? ...Wait, look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What is it, Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Figs, humans. Pepper, mushrooms. Burdock, corpses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Burdock, corpses. Spring herbs, toadstools. Cucumber, winter melon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Count to one hundred, and get a demon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The demon parade has come again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power has returned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Why, hello, everyone. I'm so glad to see you all looking well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Whoa, there! Let's not get carried away, little miss. I'm not here to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>There's a little matter I'd like to speak with you on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You want to talk? After you've snuffed out the flames of so many?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hmm? You got quiet for a moment. Are you prepared to hear me out, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>One matter. You may address one matter with us. Make it count.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>In that case, I pose a question to you: was it not the humans who tyrannically wielded their ideologies over us first?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Don't even listen to this beast's drivel. It's not worth your time. Shouldn't you be planning how to cut it down instead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I want to know what it's talking about. There's too much we don't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Good, good. I expect you'll find this subject quite interesting indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>So, let me rephrase my question a bit: why do you believe humans are in the right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Humans, as a rule, attempt to eliminate anyone who isn't like they are. Can that truly be called righteousness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What do you mean, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Allow me to provide an example scenario.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Let's say there's a man who has a close friend, and let's say their bond is even stronger than blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>"I'll stand by you, no matter what."<br>The man and his friend both say something trite like this to each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>And nothing actually changes between them. Nothing at all aside from outward appearance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Yet outward appearance is enough, it would seem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That man's appearance changes, and on that fact alone, his dear friend tries to kill him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>The man can't make heads or tails of it. Mostly because, at the time, the man doesn't even know his own appearance has changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>He only notices when, after barely escaping with his life, he happens to catch his reflection in the surface of a lake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>"I'll stand by you, no matter what," they'd both said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>But that was clearly just an empty platitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>So, in this instance, who is in the wrong? The man had no desire to fight his friend. He never fought back. He simply defended himself from what would've been a mortal attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I-I don't—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That man never truly understood why his friend had turned on him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>If, say, you were that man...would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'm...so confused. What does all of this mean?</td>
</tr>
