<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>—The footsteps of disaster have arrived on our doorstep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The beast stirs. Soon we'll be able to feel its breath on our necks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This is why we need hope. The choice to accept the end...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That ending which was predetermined... To erase the sins of the past and start afresh—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>So this is where you've been.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh? Now this is a rare sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What inspired a people-hating shut-in such as yourself to leave the room in the middle of the day?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh? It's not like I hate people, or even particularly dislike them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Bold words from someone who can't even make eye contact with anyone besides me or the master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm not that bad. Are you sure you're not mistaking me for someone else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm just teasing you, grumpy. Don't get into too many fights once I'm gone, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm afraid I can't hold it off much longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So... You're really going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah... There's not much time left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If we humans wish to survive this calamity, then I'll have to venture into the outside world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There must be something we haven't tried yet. We only just started our observation and research, so if you could wait a little longer—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...I leave that in your hands, Ambrosia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>While you search for a solution within these borders, I will search outside of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then, even if one of us is to fail, the other will be able to pick up the slack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...Snf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>C'mon now, no crying... You know I'm terrible with this kind of thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Don't worry. I'll definitely be back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No matter how far I go or how long it'll take. I'll definitely be back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That was the last time we spoke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It may be some silly long forgotten promise by this point, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>—it was a promise I made to someone I saw as a little sister. I can't go breaking it now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>So I'll definitely come back. No matter what I must sacrifice to make it happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>This I swear in the name of the Infinite Serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>—The continent shudders with what is to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Wrath... Rage and loathing that burns with endless flame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>They wriggle and writhe in that sea of crimson in their attempt to change the very core of humankind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Will Satna's wrath be able to cleanse the Ira Belt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I wonder what lies ahead...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You are determined to go, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes. This is the only way to gather more information and stop whatever the Infinite Serpent is planning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's why we must infiltrate the heart of the Ira Belt, where their castle lies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'll be there to guide them, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Honestly, I fear I wasn't too much help in subjugating the Leviathan back there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>So all I can really do is beg and plead for you to save my country anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No need to be humble. You were quite helpful in that last battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And your guidance through these foreign lands will be more than enough aid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Unfortunately, I fear we won't be able to approach the Ira Belt by airship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What?! My baby is capable of withstanding any weather or terrain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We can handle it! Didn't I carry you through that blizzard in the Luxuria Belt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I seem to remember you crashing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yeah, you crashed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That was for unrelated reasons! If it wasn't for Asmodeus we would've been fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>He's not wrong. That airship of his can take a beating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So even I'm a bit confused about why you wouldn't want to take it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Remember the words of the Fallen King Arius for a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Haha, fools! You don't even understand that much? Your techniques rely too much on concentrating the magil into a single blow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But my magil is the type that burns down everything it touches! It will not bend to such a weak will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>He may have been a Fallen gripped by madness, but his sword was steady and his tactics were executed with purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But he did not use any magic or other such techniques... No, rather...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It would be more accurate to say that our—Mira's—powers had little effect on him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Exactly. That's what I'm thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It's possible that magil isn't a readily available resource in the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>A...resource?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>For example, if Ambrosia's magic is something that adds color to magil...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Then the Ira Belt is a place that makes magil burn and deteriorate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It's possible that our techniques were less effective on the mad king for that very reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I see... Space-Time Manipulation is especially dependent on manipulating the magil in the air.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>If something meddles with the magil in any certain location, the effects of Space-Time Manipulation would be considerably reduced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Wait! Doesn't that mean we're just deadweight?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Oh... I see. And the airship needs to absorb a lot of magil from the atmosphere to fly, so—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>There's a chance it won't have the power to keep moving when we get there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Indeed. It wouldn't be so bad if it was just some minor malfunctioning machinery, but we can't risk a crash.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>This ship is our primary mode of transportation. We can't afford to lose it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Perhaps it is overly cautious, but that is why I'd rather not use the airship this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Aw, man. I mean, that makes sense. Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What're we gonna do instead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>We could take the airship to the border and then continue on foot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>But I fear there won't be any place to hide the ship when we get there. We'd have to risk leaving it out in the open.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Actually, I have a proposal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>If you're departing for the Ira Belt, please allow us to lend you our aid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You would?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You've helped our kingdom survive to see another day. Please allow us to return the favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>We will deploy the Purple Flame Knight's fleet. Additionally, we will construct a garrison near the border and prepare for a quick evacuation if necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>We appreciate the offer, but do you know what you're offering here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>If you do this for us, the Ira Belt will likely consider it an act of aggression.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>It will be seen as an attempt to launch an invasion by your side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>We understand the consequences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Rest assured, we do not act solely for your sakes. We have our own concerns as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Your own concerns?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>The "night of fire rain"... Andechs, you spoke of this calamity before. Did you not come to seek our aid in order to prevent this disaster?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>In other words, this calamity threatens the existence of the Ira Belt, not unlike the way Leviathan threatened ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>It would be easy to save our own hides. All we'd have to do is shut you out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>We could avoid tragedy by pretending there isn't one playing out before our very eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>But I could never do such a thing. It goes against everything Invidia Belt stands for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>As those who were saved by another, so do we have the duty to save others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>We must lend a hand to those in the Ira Belt, for they are humans just like the rest of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Your Highness, will you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Yes. I've made up my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>From here on, we will do everything within our power to save the citizens of the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>We will strike down the Cursed Beast that's causing this calamity, as well as the mastermind who orchestrated this conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Furthermore, if the Ira Belt is to reject its people, we will receive them with open arms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>So you'll take in Ira Belt refugees? So that's why you said you'd set up camp at the border.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>But the Invidia Belt is limited in space...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>If you undertake such an operation, your own folk may be forced to compete for resources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>There's no need to worry about such a thing. Right, Imnus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Yes, my liege!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>The ocean has started to recede with the defeat of Leviathan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>The ocean is receding?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Indeed. It's been centuries since we've last observed such a phenomenon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>But at this rate, the Invidia Belt's territory is set to double by the time it abides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>We will be able to cultivate these new lands and we hope that doing so will allow us to enter a new era. One where we can allow even more people to live freely within our borders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>You're the one that brought about this blessing for us, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>This was our doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>That's why I tell you not to worry. Instead, focus on your own goals, and choose the path that will save even more people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Nimul? What are you looking at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Oh, Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I was looking at the ocean. It's slowly pulling back, just like the king said. They're going to have the move the harbor at this rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Isn't it great, though? Your actions managed to reduce the causalities in this region, even if it was just a little bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>True...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>What's wrong? Tell me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I thought you'd be happier about all of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I am. There's just something gnawing at my chest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I know that the Invidia Belt expanding its territory is a good thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>But I feel...displeased with the idea of saving people just by accident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I still don't understand the truth of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I barely understand what my own actions entail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Isn't okay not to understand it in its entirety? You still saved all these people. That fact doesn't change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>It's fine to take it one step at a time. Or to make mistakes, or get confused sometimes. As long as you just don't give up and keep going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>We'll just keep on moving. I'm sure the sky at the end of the road will be the most wonderful color.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>...Yeah. I hope it will be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Make haste, make haste! Be ready to sail at dawn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Our lead ship will carry the airship! Careful now! Don't scratch it! All our hopes ride on it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Are all the supplies on board? Excellent, get ready to set sail!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Dang, look at that spirit and dedication! Wish I had someone like that to work for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>You've got to be popular for that to work. Take a look over there. King Patricius just oozes charisma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Think you could act like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>No... No, I could not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Mira's going to scold you guys if she sees the two of you playing around like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>You can depend on them when it matters, but it really is like watching kids sometimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Heh. Someone sounds like a cranky old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Do I...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Nimul, preparations for departure have been completed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Yes, thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>There's one more thing. I'd like to accompany you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>It'd be a great help, but are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Yes. This was also the king's wish. As the Shield Maiden it is my duty to protect the peace of these lands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Well, your help would be very welcome then. By the way—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Do you know what she's doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>L-Lady Nicaea?! Why are you on this ship?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Phew, I made it! I just figured I should come and lend a helping hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>You have to do no such thing! Why are you here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Well, when it comes to the ocean, no one is faster than Selsieg here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>That's why we'll be doing patrols! At least until we hit land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Bwrii bwriizp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>I didn't hear a thing about this! Don't tell me you snuck onboard without permission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>I-I swear I told someone! I even asked Imnus for permission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>...Fine. But don't be too reckless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Of course! I'll be good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Bwirruru, bwri!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Oh, Selsieg? Did you spot something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Not good! Stand back, my lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Gyuuuugyuuugyuuuaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>The monsters of the ocean critters must be bewildered by the change in their habitat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>I'm sorry, little ones. But this is our ocean now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Return from whence you came!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Briiiwp!</td>
</tr>
