</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eula.png" alt="Eulalia" height="128"><br>Eulalia</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Exactly. That's what I'm thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>It's possible that magil isn't a readily available resource in the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>

<td>A...resource?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>For example, if Ambrosia's magic is something that adds color to magil...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Then the Ira Belt is a place that makes magil burn and deteriorate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>It's possible that our techniques were less effective on the mad king for that very reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_niku.png" alt="Nyx" height="128"><br>Nyx</td>
<td>I see... Space-Time Manipulation is especially dependent on manipulating the magil in the air.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_niku.png" alt="Nyx" height="128"><br>Nyx</td>
<td>If something meddles with the magil in any certain location, the effects of Space-Time Manipulation would be considerably reduced.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adre.png" alt="Adaleigh" height="128"><br>Adaleigh</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>There's a chance it won't have the power to keep moving when we get there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Indeed. It wouldn't be so bad if it was just some minor malfunctioning machinery, but we can't risk a crash.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>

<td>If you're departing for the Ira Belt, please allow us to lend you our aid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>You would?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>You've helped our kingdom survive to see another day. Please allow us to return the favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>We will deploy the Purple Flame Knight's fleet. Additionally, we will construct a garrison near the border and prepare for a quick evacuation if necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>We appreciate the offer, but do you know what you're offering here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>If you do this for us, the Ira Belt will likely consider it an act of aggression.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>It will be seen as an attempt to launch an invasion by your side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>We understand the consequences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>Rest assured, we do not act solely for your sakes. We have our own concerns as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Your own concerns?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>The "night of fire rain"... Andechs, you spoke of this calamity before. Did you not come to seek our aid in order to prevent this disaster?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>In other words, this calamity threatens the existence of the Ira Belt, not unlike the way Leviathan threatened ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>It would be easy to save our own hides. All we'd have to do is shut you out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>We could avoid tragedy by pretending there isn't one playing out before our very eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>But I could never do such a thing. It goes against everything Invidia Belt stands for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>As those who were saved by another, so do we have the duty to save others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>We must lend a hand to those in the Ira Belt, for they are humans just like the rest of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Your Highness, will you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>Yes. I've made up my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>From here on, we will do everything within our power to save the citizens of the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>We will strike down the Cursed Beast that's causing this calamity, as well as the mastermind who orchestrated this conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>Furthermore, if the Ira Belt is to reject its people, we will receive them with open arms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/iena.png" alt="Yna Ku" height="128"><br>Yna Ku</td>
<td>So you'll take in Ira Belt refugees? So that's why you said you'd set up camp at the border.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>But the Invidia Belt is limited in space...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>If you undertake such an operation, your own folk may be forced to compete for resources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>There's no need to worry about such a thing. Right, Imnus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>Yes, my liege!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>The ocean has started to recede with the defeat of Leviathan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>The ocean is receding?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>Indeed. It's been centuries since we've last observed such a phenomenon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>But at this rate, the Invidia Belt's territory is set to double by the time it abides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>We will be able to cultivate these new lands and we hope that doing so will allow us to enter a new era. One where we can allow even more people to live freely within our borders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>You're the one that brought about this blessing for us, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>This was our doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>That's why I tell you not to worry. Instead, focus on your own goals, and choose the path that will save even more people.</td>
