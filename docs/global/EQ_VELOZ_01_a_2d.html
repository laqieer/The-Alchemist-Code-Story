<td>001</td>
<td>The same sky... The unchanging view...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The cityscape down below also hasn't changed in the slightest. It's almost as if time has stopped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Just as it has for me...ever since that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Whoa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A-a kid? What are you doing here? Are you lost?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, are you the new protector of the clock tower?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No, I'm...how can I explain it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wow! Amazing! This view is so pretty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What? A-ah... It's pretty incredible, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ever since he told me about this place...it's been a favorite of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Young miss! Where are you?! Young miss?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm going to run out of patience! Please, come out! Young miss!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh, it's Ethan! Over here, over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huff...huff...! S-so this is where you were!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You suddenly disappeared. I nearly had a heart attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I was talking with this man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hm! Veloz...did you bring the young miss here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>N-no, I didn't! You're mistaken!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>He was sitting here! He said it was his favorite place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Were you sneaking into here again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No, well...I was just...remembering things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I see. But rules are rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Only protectors of the clock tower are allowed inside here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Sorry. By the way, who is this girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I never heard about you having a daughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I-idiot! Don't be rude! This is Mayor Edward's daughter, Miss Fiona.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Mayor Edward has a daughter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm responsible for her today. Don't do anything rude, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hey, Ethan. Is this man a clock protector?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>His name is Veloz. He's a mechanical engineer who works in Real Heaven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>He is quite talented for his age. Occasionally, we have him inspect the clock tower's mechanics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Flattery won't gain you anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hahah. No need to be so modest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Besides, it seems like we'll have more opportunities to offer you work in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Right now, we're testing out the use of a security Alkaroid for this clock tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>A security Alkaroid...?! Are you talking about that Alkaroid that the Beckrams announced?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hahah. Look at that change in your eyes. You're pretty sharp-sighted when it comes to new products like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Once the practical application of Alkaroids is implemented, you should have an increased role.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But why Alkaroids? This clock tower has been under the management of the Elesters since ancient times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Also doesn't the Elesters have the Alkemono series?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It seems like the Beckrams are desperate to sell their Alkaroids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>They even asked the Elesters to try them out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>These are people who may very well be our rivals eventually. Honestly, the master is too kind-hearted sometimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ohhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It's the sound of celebration bells! Wow, wow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Indeed. You can hear it louder than anywhere else here, can't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It's the...sound of happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The sounds of happiness...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ye-yes... What's the matter? Did I say something strange?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>No. It's just that I knew someone who said something similar. It surprised me a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hey...has time...still stopped for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...Sorry. I should be getting back to work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Veloz...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>See you, Veloz!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The sound of happiness, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Lord Alvarez, preparation has been completed. All 30 deployed Alkaroids are under control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>All right. Begin immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>There should be some kind of clue in that clock tower. Don't miss even the smallest detail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>This towering clock tower from an ancient era...there must be some hint that leads to the Sacred Stone Belphegor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>All right, repairs completed. I guess that does it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hey, what's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Whoa?! Hey, don't call out all of a sudden. It's dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Wait, Fiona?! What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>There are so many machines! Hey...do you work here, Veloz?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Y-yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Oh, I've seen this before! It's a machine that makes bread!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Very good. This is a bakery cauldron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>At first glance, it appears to be a normal cauldron, but it's different. A special material is used for the coating inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Special...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>It's created with a special cutting-edge material that has high heat conductive value. Put in numbers, when comparing it with current products...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Heat...conduc...tive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Ah...sorry. Of course, you don't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Heheh. I guess you like machines. Jeez, Veloz. You remind me of Ethan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Ah...I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Oh! This photo...there's a woman in it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>That's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hey, this person... Is she the one who told you about your favorite place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Well, yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Is she your lover? She's so beautiful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Yes, she was beautiful. And she was very kind-hearted...more so than I deserved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Did she go somewhere?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Yes. Somewhere very far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You can't see her anymore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Yes. Unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I see. It's sad, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Anyway, did you come here for something specific?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Oh, that's right! My father sent me on an errand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Your father...you mean the mayor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Yes! He told me to call you up to the clock tower!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>But don't you think it's dangerous? Maybe it's best if we call someone from the Beckrams...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>No. First, we must determine the cause on our own. It may be a risk to the entire city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Excuse me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Ah, I'm glad you came. Let me introduce you. This is Mayor Edward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>So you're Veloz. Thank you for always looking after Ethan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I've hardly looked after him. I'm just a mechanical engineer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Why did you call me here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>The thing is...last night, we had an incident where the security Alkaroid...the Guard Droid went rogue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Went rogue?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>That's not all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Do you know the bell in the clock tower? Its power unit has been occupied by the rogue Guard Droid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Hey, hold on. You're not expecting me to go there and stop it, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>I heard that you are well-versed with mechanical technology. I want you to lend us your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>He-hey, hold on! Why me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>First of all...shouldn't you be dealing with someone associated with the Beckrams?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>You should be calling the Beckrams not me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>No, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>To tell you the truth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Before we call the Beckrams, we want to be sure that there is no serious flaw with the Alkaroids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Master...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>It's okay, Ethan. What he says makes sense. But...I want you to consider this for the sake of the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Currently, the Beckrams are rushing to expand the uses of their Alkaroids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>That alone is not problematic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>However...if there is a serious flaw in this product that they're so proud of...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>You think they might try to hide it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>We can only make assumptions at this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>But...if something like that were to happen, the victims would be the people of the city who use their products.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>As mayor, I must prevent any danger from occurring in this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>You're interested in Alkaroids, aren't you, Veloz?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Honestly. How can I resist when you put it that way? I may not be able to obtain the necessary results. Please don't rely on me too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I'm sorry for asking the impossible of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Regarding the bell, I'll need to see it first before I can say anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>First of all, we need to decide what to do about the Guard Droid.</td>
</tr>
