<td>So this is it...the cave where the Sephirium is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You called it the Temporal Cave, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ye-yes. According to the ancient traditions, it is said to be a passage that connects this world with the underworld.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The truth is that it's just a regular cave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(But...I'm scared. Deep within here is...an ancient darkness...the old world of death.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmm. All right. Let's go then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh...oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(Why aren't they afraid of this darkness?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ohh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(I...need to go too!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's pretty dark in here. Careful, dad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Don't treat me like an old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...Sorry, but I don't like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't understand how you could be so frightened of dying while you're still alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Maybe what you're really afraid of is being alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Or better put...you're so afraid of dying that you've become scared of living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Are you...really alive right now? Or are you dead even as you live? That's how it appears to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We are those who unite wisdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(It is human nature to fear death. It is inevitable for those who live to die. Afraid of death?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Dead even as I live...? Unite wisdom? My...compatriots? I don't understand. What...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(What am I afraid of?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Le-let's go back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Seriously? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We can't! We must not go any further!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Look. I don't mind you being afraid, but could you not get in the way of ourâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No, you don't understand! Ku Yogi...you...you're going to die soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yeah. I know that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm sick. Miuna knows that as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...If you know that then why are you doing this? Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...There was this man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>He came to me with a request to weld a weapon. He wanted a sword that would lose to no other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>There was a strong sense of determination in his voice-an unwavering belief in something. It was the voice of a man who had resolved himself.<br><br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Resolve...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes...resolve. However, I am a blacksmith hired by a man of a certain status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm not supposed to accept requests from other individuals. That's why I turned him down. I turned him down, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Heh. I was moved by that man...by the resolve in Zehn's voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yes...I don't have long to live. That's why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>For my final creation as a blacksmith, I've been itching to make him that sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>("Until the moment I die, I want to listen to the voice of the iron that I strike, weld, and sharpen!" That is Ku Yogi's way of living...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Uzuma...I won't discount your fears or your way of thinking. We can't help what we're afraid of. Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Can you help me complete my final creation until the end? Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(But, still...this man is headed to his death! If he continues this way...Ku Yogi will die!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I don't know... Wh-what should I do...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If you don't know, then I'll tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Come with us. That's the answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Seriously. You guys again. You really are an annoying bunch, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Say what you like. We are here to accomplish our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Your mission, huh? Well, the same goes for me. I'm here to complete a very important job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Enough! How dare you place our noble purpose and your so-called job in the same boat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>How dare you! Everyone carries their own purpose in life. I'd appreciate if you didn't pass judgment on mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...It appears we can't see eye to eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>For once I agree with you! Miuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Heh. I summon you...slave of wisdom...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Gurrrr...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>They've summoned a monster...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hyahahah! We're taking Uzuma with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Tsk! Those scum!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Gurrraaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Ack! Get out of the way, monster!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We've finally...finally obtained Uzuma! Our long-cherished wish can finally be achieved!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Your long-cherished wish? What are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Heh...heheheh...hyahahah! We've found it! Behold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Oh! That's...the Sephirium!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Yes! This is the resin secreted from Sephiron. It is literally Sephiron's blood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>We can now fulfill our long-cherished wish...we can resurrect our mother, the giant green tree Sephiron!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Re-resurrect Sephiron...?! Is that possible?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It is. All we need is the Sephirium, you, Uzuma...and that hourglass of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Why me...and why the hourglass?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>So you had it all this time without knowing? That hourglass contains the Sands of Life that once nourished the roots of Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>That sand can nurture various life...it is the only substance that can restore life to Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>After we plant the seeds of Sephiron reproduced from the Sephirium and allow it to germinate in that sand...the only remaining ingredient will be you, Uzuma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Your flesh and blood will serve as nourishment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Rejoice! Your body will serve as a sacrifice to Sephiron! Hyahahahahah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Ah, so gathering from what I heard from your speech, your mission is to plant a tree, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Ku Yogi...Miuna?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Well, I'm sure it's an important tree, but...I'm not fully convinced that it's worth exchanging the life of this young girl for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You...! How did you get this far?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Here's how it is: I'm practically blind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>...No way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Instead, my hearing is exceptionally good. All I did was follow your loud voices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>(He can't see? It didn't seem that way at all until now. More importantly...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>(Did he come all this way without being able to see...and being fully aware of his own impending death?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>(Is that what it means to be resolved? What strength...the blinding radiance of life!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Dad, the Sephirium is here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Yes, even I can tell. It's still alive. I can feel its strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>But it's resin, not ore, right? Can you really make a weapon out of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Heh. Sephirium's resin is many times harder than your average ore. There won't be any problem. Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I'm Ku Yogi. Whether it be resin or diamonds, there is no substance I cannot use to make a weapon out of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Yeah, got it. All right, let's get our hands on it...even if we have to use force!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>We're not going to let a blind man and a brat rob us of our Sephirium!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>It's not just us. There's her as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Hey! Scaredy-cat! You're afraid of dying, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>At this rate, you're going to be turned into fertilizer for that tree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>(I can feel Miuna's radiance! It's blinding! How can people shine so brightly?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>(I want to shine as well!!!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Don't tell me you're willing to remain silent while they kill you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>No! No, of course not! I'm going to live!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Haahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Aghh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Not bad! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>We won't allow it!</td>
