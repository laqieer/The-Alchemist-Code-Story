<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Whoa! This ship's fast! No other pirate boat can keep up with this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Indeed. I wasn't sure how this private vessel would fare, but it demonstrates a fine use of magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's amazing! It was fortunate those on shore lent it to us, since they can't sail with all the pirates around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We should reach our destination in no time. We need to hurry to investigate, and restore peace to the waves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes, we do. It's my first time on a treasure hunt, yet with you all here I feel reassured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Still, I hope I will make myself of some use. The topography is somewhat similar to a desert, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>By the way, are you planning to search dressed like that, Xiao-Xiao?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh? Of course! We were originally going to guard the beach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes, but with the area deserted, there's no need for us to protect it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>With the nearby waters becoming flooded with pirates, it's no wonder really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's to be expected. Pirates can't pass up something like a map with buried treasure on it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>True. But deciphering the map with its codes and bits missing is tricky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We figured it out thanks to Su Yi, but it would seem the other buccaneers haven't discovered the cave yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Fights keep breaking out between the different factions still looking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That is a problem. Treasure hunting seems so adventurous, but it's also a boatload of trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The sea should belong to everyone, but this is making mayhem for even those not looking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You have a point. Things at the beach aren't good. We should try to get this over quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Everyone seems to have become acutely aware of the trouble pirates can cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes, I've heard stories... Like there was a pirate who summoned a strange monster from a cave while looking for treasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It stole swimwear and caused a ruckus. Still, it seems people were able to safely deal with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huh... That sounds oddly familiar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Seems odd rumors have spread surrounding the details with the octopuses... Such a shameful thing. But it is what it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>And yet...the treasure map...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Have you realized something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>In our time, the whole area must be dug up. I don't think the treasure will be there now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>And it's odd how rumors of the map have spread so absurdly fast among pirates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>True... And it's bizarre how there are copies of the map circulating with the rumors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes, there is something mysterious about all of it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But if you think there actually might be a treasure, doesn't that get you excited, Su Yi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Uh, well... I think things seem suspicious, too. Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If the map is real, then I am grateful I get to go on another treasure hunt with you all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You put it so well, Su Yi! It's the pirate's life for us! One of thrilling adventure and derring-do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's all well and good, but don't get too carried away with the romance of it. No wandering off in strange ruins again, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I couldn't know I was stumbling across an evil cult worshipping a giant octopus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>When you get lost...you really get lost. Do you have ANY sense of direction? I hope our ship's heading is correct...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Not to worry! Su Yi knows the currents better than anyone, and Liu Shen is a master helmsman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Pfew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh, that's right! I wanted to check on the supplies you brought on board together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(Shenmei entrusts the routing, supply manifest, and even helming the ship to her subordinates.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(She seems to have a good sense of how everything works, but... There's something off.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Nefertiti? Is there some reason you've been staring at me? Do I have something on my face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No. I was just observing the talents of the captain of the Xiao Shenmei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What?! An attack?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Shenmei! There's a ship headed our way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Your orders, Captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It looks like they're going to hit us! We have no choice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>All hands prepare to intercept! Remember, we're borrowing this ship, so try not to damage it!</td>
</tr>
