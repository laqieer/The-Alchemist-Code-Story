<td>Come one, come all! The freshest vegetables straight from Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Water and food, enough for two weeks. The cheapest you have is fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I can't believe we can't get started yet! We came all the way out here to build some noble their mansion, and we have to wait?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So, this is the Desert Zone, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>A bit unrefined, but it's got a good, lively atmosphere. There's something not quite right about it, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This place is too put together to have just received Liberation Army and Sephira refugees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ow! Hey, watch it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh. I apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hm? Hey, did you come from out of town?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes, from Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh! That's rare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I escaped the civil war in Gluttony and came here in search of my friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Have you seen any refugees around here recently?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Uh, did you hit your head or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The civil war in Gluttony, right? With the military coup that ended with the general becoming king?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That happened, like, decades ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That battle against Ceclidis and his forces was decades ago?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Decades?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Was I wandering the desert for that long?! Impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If it had really been that long, I would have aged!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Alchemy is a deep and varied art. While pushing the limits of its possibilities, at some point I realized I had become more spirit than human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This immortality is my curse for plunging into the most forbidden depths of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No... It couldn't be that, could it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If so much time has passed, any leads that might help me find my friends must be cold already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Still, I can't give up. I swore to find them! I must believe they survived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Even if it was ages ago, there must be someone who remembers what happened! I just have to find them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Are you certain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yeah, they didn't have the mark on their bodies or whatever, but there was a community of refugees who escaped Gluttony some decades ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Do you know where to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I could tell you, but if you don't mind me saying, I don't think you want to go there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Why would that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>They are retainers to the nobility. I don't know how or why, but the upper class of this country protects them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>All that can mean is that there's something shady about them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Let me give you some advice, sir: stay away. No need to stir up unnecessary trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But even so...I must try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If you say so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The settlement is in that direction, beyond three oases. Just be prepared for a rough time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>This is...worse than I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The Alchemia held in the sand here must be destabilizing the climate in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This is no place for people to live. Could the Sephira really be here? Well, I suppose that would be a good deterrent to anyone poking their noses around this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Halt, traveler.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>There is only barren wasteland beyond this point. You will gain nothing there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You will not find whatever it is that you seek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>On the contrary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The people I seek must be here. Those whose devotion to Sephiron and her compassion is emblazoned upon their bodies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You..? Could it really be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>My name is Kamui. I've come to fulfill my duties as Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>K-Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Could you be...Hisham?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It really is you! Your eyes, your face... Everything about you is just as I remember!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hisham... You've changed quite a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Of course I have! Do you have any idea how long it's been?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Everybody I cared for... Everybody we knew, they're gone, and I've... I've been...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hisham, I'm sorry to have made you wait for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Uuh... Uuaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The soil is withered... Could this also have been caused by the loss of Sephiron?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That's what the wise women who survived said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>They said that Babel is adjusting to a new natural order after the destruction of the old one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The expansion of the desert is the result of that? I take it this new natural order does not like humans very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Life in the desert isn't so bad. There is much to be learned simply by surviving day by day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hm? Did I say something funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Oh, no. I was just remembering... You always enjoyed the pursuit of knowledge. You've really grown into an impressive adult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It has been a long time since anybody talked to me like I was a child. This is...somewhat embarrassing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>On the other hand, you have not changed at all. I'm surprised that you don't feel worse after all that time in the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I know what you mean. It almost scares me, how good I feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>It has been too long since we were separated on that battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Time turns all emotions, anger, and sadness alike into dust and carries them away on the wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Yes, I cannot disagree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I am grateful that you kept the Sephira survivors together, especially since it has made it possible for us to meet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Unfortunately, I was not a particularly good leader. We lost many before I gained the experience and wisdom to lead well. By then, I was already beginning to really feel my age...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>If we had not been separated from Isidore...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>That day, the Jam descended upon us like a tidal wave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ea-earthquake?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>No... I sense that energy that makes me feel like my skin is on fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>A giant wave of the Jam?! Hisham! Get over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I-it's no use! They're gonna...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Ngh—aaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Isidore...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hurry! Take everybody far from here! I won't be able to hold this for long!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Everybody! Hurry, this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>That was the last person! Isidore, hurry! Over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>What?! Oh, n—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I-Isidore?! Isidore! No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Isidore and Malta were never found.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I see... I'm sorry. That must have been tough for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Yes... The years have been long, indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>That day, the sephirah disappeared from the skin of most Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>In addition, we all grieved the loss of Sephiron's protection from this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>And yet...you survived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Yes, we survived. Sadly, that's all we've done. We haven't managed anything more than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I don't know how they find us, but there are some raiders that target the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>The nobles of this desert see the Sephira bloodline as nothing more than some resource to be taken control of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>If things remain as they are, we will soon be torn apart and forget the importance of our heritage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Perhaps that might be best for the Sephira in the long run, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>It is too early to give up, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Yes, I do. We must believe there is some purpose to our survival. To that end, it is necessary to continue to protect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>No, not just protect. We must also teach and share the Sephira's traditions, crafts, and the compassionate will of Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>A strong bond among the Sephira people is paramount to achieving that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Have you decided on a name yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I have. We shall deliver the Sephira, the fruits of the desert, into the next generation. If that is our task, then—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>We shall call ourselves the Fruit Peddlers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>A secret society?! Sorry, but I don't know about anything like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Besides, those Sephira that you speak of... Sure, some decades ago, a bunch of them came here as refugees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Since then, I've heard that most of them were actually just mercenaries or former soldiers of Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>While they were here, public order went right down the drain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>To be honest, most people don't even like talking about that period of time, so watch who you bring this topic up with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Thank you for your advice. By the way, could I get one of those fruits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Well, you're a big spender, ain't ya? Most travelers just stock up on water and the cheapest food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Uh, um... I was just going to visit a friend, and I figured it would be rude not to bring a gift.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Heheh, let me guess. She's cute and you like her, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I-it's not like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Well, whatever. Here you go. I've even wrapped it up pretty for you. Be careful out there, kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I will. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I should've known it wouldn't be that easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>I came all the way out here with the information I gleaned from mother's stories, but I guess this is the end of the line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I guess it really was just some rumor that Sephira survivors built themselves a community in the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Hey, kid! Watch where you're going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I'm sorry, I didn't mean to! I was so lost in thought—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Hey, now... Those are some pretty nice clothes you got. You a noble or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Well, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I can't believe this. We work our asses off all day to make a living, while nobles like this waste of space get to take cute little vacations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>I-it's not like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>(He's alone. I'd prefer to talk this out, but he doesn't seem to be willing to listen.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>(I'll just make a run for it when I get the chance.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Just looking at you pisses me off! Hey, guys, get out here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>There're too many! I might be in trouble here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Thugs really are the same, no matter where you go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Do you not find it shameful to outnumber a kid by so many? Let me assist you, young one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, uh, thank you!</td>
