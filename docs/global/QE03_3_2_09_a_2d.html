<td>There's still a way! The sweet alcohol you have is a hint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The caramel jaeger?</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That sweet alcohol originates from Slothstein, right? That made me remember something.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It was such an extreme rumor that I didn't believe it at the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It must lack credibility if even you didn't believe it, Alma.</td>

<td>What Dias said earlier confirmed it though.</td>

<td>Dias?!</td>

<td>It was a rumor that a man had infiltrated this country a little while ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>He was caught a few seconds after entering...but apparently, he'd entered from Slothstein.</td>

<td>Another man that isn't Dias?!</td>

<td>A Paladin is one thing, but it's hard to believe that a regular man could enter this country's security...</td>

<td>Belphegor...?</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I heard that you were after the Sacred Stone, but...</td>

<td>Don't tell me you're also trying to get your hands on Belphegor as well!</td>

<tr>

<td>Wh-what are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's not a redeeming quality to interrupt people's conversations!</td>
