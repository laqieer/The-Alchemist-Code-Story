<td>Get over there, you numbskulls! And make sure the power's thoroughly cut!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I swear, not a drop of competence to be found!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There, there, Master. They're scientists, not soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That said, this is quite the headache... We can fiddle with these robots all we want, but the directives remain a confusing mystery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And Zheng Yi is as frigid as an iceberg. One wonders whether his bedroom is really a cemetery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Keep trying. Apart from throttling him entirely, turning up scraps of instructions buried in some stinking ditch is all we can do about these useless robots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Li Wang angrily kicks at a Construct's severed head, sending it rolling to a stop at someone's boot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>D-Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>These "useless robots" will one day shape a perfect world, Li Wang. Have care what you utter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I understand. My apologies, Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>As they are now, however, they are little more than thoughtless killing machines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Rather similar to humans, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...Perhaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hm. The Core's true functionality is only a fraction of what I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I take it that the directives you procured were not complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Rest assured that they will be, soon enough. I have received further pieces of the puzzle not two hours ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>As you were, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Grimm gives the haphazard laboratory a look of mild derision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You'd do well not to repeat this incident, Marshal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Your promises to the Director were rather lofty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Insufferable suit. As if he wasn't terrified of losing his precious master's affections.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Enough. We have more important things to clean up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You! What are you gawping at? Get these directives installed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(How was the Director able to figure out a robot's functionality simply by glancing at its severed head?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(Wiser to keep dancing to their tune...for now.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Several days later, at the outskirts of Greed Dike...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Strange...this has a totally different feeling from that little town we met in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The closer it is to the capital, the more opulent and luxurious it gets. Pure posturing, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I don't like this place. It feels so...oppressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The coast is clear. Should we split up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>There are multiple paths to our destination, but all are delineated by a deceptively simple waymark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Follow these markers along the dirt path, and stick to the shadows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Stay close to me, Eira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Okay, Emmy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That's amazing... It's so easy to miss these. They camouflage so well with the cobblestones!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Humans never cease to amaze me even after all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If only it was merely pleasantry and none of the violence we're so prone to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The still air brings to mind the musty aroma of long-dried flowers and a vague hint of steel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>*cough* What is this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Looks like something terrible happened here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>One of our safehouses. They have been in use for quite sometime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>This one hasn't been ransacked by Li Wang's men, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Shion feels for something behind a creaking bookshelf, and retrieves a tiny key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>He fishes up a small lockbox from a hidden compartment beneath the floorboards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>This was as much as we were able to dismantle. The main Core was too large to conceal, so we salvaged its parts instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>These look like...metal plates of some sort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hmm...Sister Atropos's components.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I wonder if that would help, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Um...Sister Atropos is really resilient. Even without several components, she can continue functioning, but...it won't be the same, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>But she should be easier to stop, since she's just operating at a basic level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That was close. I saw a patrol combing the fringes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>They must have been ordered to search for something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Eira...don't like this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>No doubt for these components. We should get going beforeâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Just then, the door opens abruptly.</td>
</tr>
