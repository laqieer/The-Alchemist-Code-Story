<td>Huff...huff...yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Well done, newcomer! Not bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Heheh. Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Still...they were stronger than I had anticipated. With the way things went down, we must prepare for considerable damage when we engage with their main army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't worry! I'll fight even harder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm counting on it. Still, we can't afford to suffer casualties. Perhaps we should call on Lucian for help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Lucian? Who's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>He's one heck of a mercenary. He usually works alone, but we usually call on him for the larger missions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Recently, he succeeded in taking out a band of unscrupulous merchants on his own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What...?! Um. Is he a kinda cool-looking guy who wears a hood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Indeed. You know him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yes! I do! I've been searching for him...all this time! I see...so his name is Lucian!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, if you know him, that makes things simpler. He should be at the tavern at this hour. Go and get him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes! Of course! Gladly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh...hey! I haven't told you which tavern yet...honestly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There's the tavern! Finally...I get to meet my bro Lucian!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(I'm different from when I met him. Will I be able to show him what little strides I've made? I wonder if he remembers me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(Whoa! I'm getting nervous! My journey has finally begunâ€”my journey to becoming a true man like my bro Lucian!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...All right, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Lucian! ...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Who are you? You don't look like you're from around these parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Um... Where's Lucian?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Who the heck is that? If you're not gonna get anything then leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Lucian isn't here...? Oh...maybe he's at another tavern. I should've asked for directions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>All right...here we go again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Lucian! ...He's not here either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This time...! Nope...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Please, be here! ...Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Sigh. I can't seem to find him anywhere. Are the stars telling me that it's too early for me to meet him again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I've come so close, but...my feet won't go any further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What am I doing? Because of my own stupidity, I've thrown away my chance to meet my bro Lucian.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>How can I face him now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I am certain you will meet him again. The stars guarantee this. The stars will guide your way, Retzius. May they bless your journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Right. The stars are with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Enough with your whining! I'm going to find him! I promised Deneb!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>No way am I giving up! All right! Let's do this! Next tavern!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ah, there you are! You just rushed off before I could finish. I've been looking for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, you're from the tavern earlier...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You're looking for Lucian, right? The tavern that Lucian often goes to is just straight up the road and down that alley on the right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You...ran all this way to tell me that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Lucian sometimes hangs out at my place. Are you going to hire him? Well, good luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Um... Straight up the road and down the alley on the right! Finally...finally I get to see my bro Lucian!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(Please be there, Lucian!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(This is where he's supposed to be...!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Phew...! All right...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(...! There he is! It's my bro Lucian! Finally...finally I get to see him!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(Calm down...keep calm, Retzius...! Wow. I'm so nervous! But...I can do this!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Lucian, here you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>My name is Retzius! As a mercenary and as a man...I'm totally obsessed with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(Deneb...Lucian and I...our stars have finally crossed paths again!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(I'm going to find what it is that I want to do! I'm going to begin my journey alongside my bro Lucian!)</td>
</tr>
