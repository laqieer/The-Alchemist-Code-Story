<td>Isidore, what is this power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I...am not sure. I just suddenly found that I could use it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My purifying powers as a Sephira seem to have diminished in exchange, but...I need this new strength to fight.</td>

<td>(This feeling... Has Isidore turned to the darkness? Isidore? Of all people? Why?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Is everything okay, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I am just concerned for you. Any power in excess will bring ruin.</td>

<td>I am aware. I will not make the same mistake again.</td>

<td>Their reinforcements have arrived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I will slaughter them! I will shred their flesh with this—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Nngh... No! No, I can't. Losing myself to battle wouldn't solve anything. I must...suppress it. Hold on...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(Isidore is beginning to lose control of himself. We should fight as few battles as possible...but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We must fight through this wave if we are to catch up to everyone.</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Kamui, I will cut a path for you. Go to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What are you saying? There's no way I'm just going to leave you behind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We will both fall at this rate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Something is wrong, Kamui. I'm burning up inside. It's like a fever I cannot shake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Isidore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's too late for me. All I feel is fury. All I can do is hate the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The voice in my head... It demands that I kill...and kill and kill...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ignore it, Isidore! That is the darkness tempting you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That voice is trying to turn you away from your righteous self!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I...know...b-but this hate... It's part of me! It's too difficult to resist!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Your death will break Malta's heart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That is the price of your death! Think about it, Isidore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You're...right. It isn't like me to be swayed by such dark thoughts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Urk! There're too many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Urgh! I...can't move?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Isidore, behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Behind me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Kamui! Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Teona?! What are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I rushed here when I was told a village was on fire in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm so sorry. Had I been here sooner...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But there are still lives we can save! Right?</td>
