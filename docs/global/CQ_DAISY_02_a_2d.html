<td>(I might be wrong, but it seemed like those thieves were after Daisy. Hmmm...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Little savage, were you aware that the Mafia are involved in that tournament in Real Heaven?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>They are likely involved in your little tournament as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's all right! It's a perfectly safe competition, nothing to worry about! Anyway, more importantly, hurry up and teach me already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(So she had no idea...but she is strong, I'll give her that. Perhaps that's why she's drawn attention to herself.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey! Don't ignore me! Hurry up and teach me how to service machines! I'll mod my Mecha Lances until they're way better than anything Leema could come up with! I'll get stronger, and stronger, and stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Listen to me, would you? This is important! That tournament of yours is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>La la la la! I'm not listening! I won't listen to a word you say until you do what I want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Tch. Fine, fine! But you'd better listen carefully to what I have to say, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes! I can do that! Hehehe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>H-huh? You're gonna close the shop? I guess you're serious about this! All right! I'll give it my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What are you doing? Quickly, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wh-where are we going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>To Drest Hill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why do we need to go outside the city?! All I'm asking you to do is teach me how to service machines—and how to make 'em!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No, what you really want is a way to get stronger, is it not? Hurry along, now, or you'll be left behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I-I guess, but... Hey! Wait up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What about this one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't make me repeat myself! It's a flower with a yellow center, about this big! The one you are holding is entirely light blue, is it not?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Why are we searching for flowers, anyway?! All I want is to get good with machines, so I can get stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We will get to that after you have helped me with my toy-making!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Jeez! How did I get stuck with a harebrained weirdo who doesn't even realize how ridiculous his hat is?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hey! Get up off the ground, you brute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ah, this feels nice. I didn't know this place was here. Hm...? Hey, wait! Isn't this the flower you were looking for, Richie?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>About time. So you finally found it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's so cute and white!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That flower symbolizes beauty, hope, purity, and peace. There are kinds with different-colored petals, but the white ones mean innocence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Innocence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>This flower is called...a daisy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Daisy?! Like my name?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Both you and this flower require nutrients from sunlight, earth, and rain in order to blossom beautifully and innocently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Your Mecha Lance may be important, but you have need of something far more valuable. Do you understand what I am trying to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yeah, but...I wonder if Leema will forgive me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>As I have just said, your charm lies in your innocence. You're not much of a thinker, so why don't you try simply tackling your problems head first?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That's not a bad idea... Wait—not much of a thinker?! Don't you think that's a little rude?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hey! You're Daisy, right? Sorry, but I'm gonna have to rough you up a little. Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I knew it. You're here on behalf of the tournament organizers, I assume?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh? What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You've gotten mixed up in some illegal gambling. I assume you heard that she was quite strong, and worried that she would interfere with your plans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You're a sharp one. I just need to rough her up enough that she can't play properly in the tournament. Don't worry, little girl—this will all be over soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh, I get it now! So that's what's going on, huh? Hee...hee...hee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh, dear. That laugh of yours always spells trouble. What are you planning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>My charm lies in my innocence, right? I was just starting to feel like I needed to stretch my legs, so you lot better be ready!</td>
</tr>
