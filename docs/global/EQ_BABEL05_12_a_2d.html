<td>Lofia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hm? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I want to get better at controlling my magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Because I... I love you and Michael so much. I never want to leave your side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But I've still got a long way to go. If I want to keep up with the two of you, I need to try harder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's the spirit! I'll lend you all the help I can, Ravina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I just keep remembering things from the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Things like...how the main reason to eat sweets is because they make you feel happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And...how the reason for inviting someone to a tea party is because eating together makes the food taste better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I guess I can't help but reminisce.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I was trying not to remember things like this since parting ways with Milis, because it hurts too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well... I'm sure I'll see her soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You do need bitter tea to enjoy sugary sweets, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's finally afternoon tea time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No snacks for you yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You've been asleep for several days, you know; since you got caught up in Chance Encounter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Time travel is hard on both the mind and the body; not to mention that your transfer point was a battlefield, of all things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You should've seen the final boss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It was quite imposing, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Pfft. No way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Anyway, I feel just fine! Argh! Nngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Told you! Lofia, your wounds were particularly bad. They aren't fully healed yet so just take it easy, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Where is Courage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>She's out on her daily patrol of the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>During our encounter, we met a girl who looked just like you, Nyx.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That would be my twin sister, Mira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>She's the one you were looking for, isn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I apologize on her behalf for all the trouble she caused you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Not at all. Besides, this is great! You've finally found her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well, yeah, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Nyx...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You know that man we met there, that Mister Will fellow...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The old guy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I knew there was something familiar about him, and now I know why.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Every single individual who has left the Holy Guard is recorded in my monocle database.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I once mentioned that there was a Wilhelm from Lustburg, did I not? According to my records, he left the Holy Guard several decades ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yet his appearance was more or less unchanged from the time of his resignation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You know what this means, right? Your encounter must have taken place several decades in the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ooh, spooky! It's just like magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Aren't you a Court Mage, or something? I would've thought you'd be used to magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Heheh. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I've got a pretty good idea of where my sister is now, so I'm gonna go back to my time to store up power for a bit, then go and get her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Why don't you just use that Chance Encounter thing again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Pfft. As if it were that easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Is it difficult?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It's not something that just anyone can do, anytime they like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Chance Encounter is a technique which can only be activated the instant in which an emotional upheaval reaches its peak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Sometimes, when you hear really good news you get a bit dizzy, right? I guess the same goes for when you find out about something tragic, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hope, despair, and the emotions that they inspire create waves, which in turn bring about very slight distortions in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>When the difference between hope and despair reaches its furthest point, it creates a rift, and pouring immense magical energy into that rift is what initiates Chance Encounter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If you know so much about it, Nyx, then surely you could bring about Chance Encounter too, couldn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Mira, my big sis...? She's a genius, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm one to consider things logically, by following the causal relationship between events starting from the point furthest in the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>My sister, though, she always has her eyes on the future. She does whatever she fancies doing. Everything she does is based on her whims.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I see. That explains why we were so randomly pulled from the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I can't do things like that. It's just not me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Besides, I don't have nearly enough power right now. I wonder if my sister took it all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Is it a kind of magic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Heh. Space-time manipulation is surely ancient witchcraft in your time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I suppose that would indeed be the case. I think I believe it now. You are from the past, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I don't care if you don't believe me or not, you know. I'm just glad you're hearing me out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>This might sound kinda weird, but if it wasn't for you two getting mixed up in that fight, I never would've found my sister. So...thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Y-you are most welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It wasn't a leisure trip or anything, you know. We ended up in some ruins with this giant thing attacking us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Would you pass on our gratitude when you return to your time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I wish we could thank Wilhelm and... What was her name again? Alby... Alba...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Are you talking about Albea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I wouldn't normally intrude like this, but I've been waiting for you to wake up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Y-you...! You're...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Do you know her, Cheryl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Sh-she's the former Captain of the 2nd Regiment of the Holy Guard... Kaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Impressive. I see that you're well-informed even on retired captains from previous decades. You're an inquisitor, I take it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You disappeared after retiring from the Holy Guard—but that was... That was decades ago!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>What?! Does that mean she's already a crone? She really doesn't look like one, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Ahahahaha! Just how old do you think I am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>M-maybe just a tiny bit older than me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I don't know your age, but I suppose I must look fairly young, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Shouldn't you be an old lady?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Perhaps decades have passed since I retired, but for me, that event was only a few days ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Wh-what does that mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>No way! Are you a time-traveler, too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>No. If I had to liken myself to someone, it would be her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>M-me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Like you, I too, was killed by the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Well, to put a finer point on it, I was killed by the dark underbelly of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>The...dark underbelly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>They are known as Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I have never heard this name before. You claim that they are part of the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Of course, they do not make their existence obvious to inquisitors like yourself. Those who know of them are shortly erased, as a matter of fact. As we were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>P-please! You must tell me of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Are you prepared for the truth of it? You might not like what I have to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I am. This is for the good of my organization, for my mission, and...above all...for Lofia's sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Corpse are a league of assassins in service to the Holy Order of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Their mission is to eliminate—in absolute secrecy—those who would touch upon the mysteries of Alchemy, as well as those who claim possession of the Sacred Stones and anything pertaining to them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>All so that they can retain their monopoly on the selfish use of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>So they were the ones who came after me! Corpse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Ugh. I can't stop the bleeding. This is bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>The reason for all of this is because the Holy Order of Babel is desperate to cover up the existence of the Cursed Beasts, as well as to silence those who learn of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>As such, the activities of the organization called Corpse can largely be divided into two different categories: warnings and elimination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Warnings involve applying pressure to those whose actions have not yet made them targets for assassination, in order to have them distance themselves from the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Of course, they are not shy about elimination—dead men tell no tales, after all. However, those who are given warnings are afforded the possibility of escaping with their lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Elimination, on the other hand, is carried out regardless of the difficulties faced. Once decided, the target's life will be taken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I didn't think I would be so disappointed to face the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>They intended to eliminate me. I was their target.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>This isn't like me at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I must...survive this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Th-this stone...should...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Othima's research created a Philosopher's Stone with the ability to seal people away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Making use of the techniques that he employed, I managed to create a similar stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>After unearthing the history of the present day, I was going to use this stone to go ahead and look upon the history of the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I imagined myself an observer of history... How foolish. It really isn't like me to daydream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I'm sorry...that I couldn't stay with you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I swear on my honor as a knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>The stone in which I was sealed fell from a gap between the flagstones of the ruins, escaping the notice of Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>It passed right through the underground of Slothstein, eventually ending up in Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>It is difficult to break the seal of such a stone, even with outside interference, so it truly was a gamble I made that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>It is the Alchemia Pura, the immense Alchemia that I carry within me, which allowed me to live for so long, preserving my life within the stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Eventually, after much time had passed, the stone's power gradually faded and the seal weakened along with it until—at long last—I was released from its confines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>When I woke, the Lion Monarch's Charge was a thing of the past and the world had changed drastically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>So too, had the Holy Order, and even the justice of the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>My, I don't usually waffle on like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I used up most of my Alchemia in my resurrection, so I am still far from at my best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I have continued my research in secret, both in Lost Blue and here in Real Heaven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Never in my wildest dreams, however, did I imagine that I would be able to meet an inquisitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>The Cursed Beasts... Corpse... The ancient army of Demonic Soldiers that I witnessed during Chance Encounter... Visitors from the distant past...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Taken together, I have ample evidence with which I can censure the Holy Order and bring its dark side into the light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>If you do all that...will I be able to return to Lustburg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Yes, although you will need to be patient for just a little longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>I wanted to talk to you about that. Erm... Lofia, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>The information that you have uncovered is likely not so different from that which I hold, making you a target for elimination by Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Well, they did try to kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Corpse is not so naive an organization as we may think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>We've already beaten them several times, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>That would be because Cheryl has been designated to receive a warning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>I suppose they did withdraw rather skillfully, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Lofia. You were healed after Chance Encounter, weren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Have you noticed anything...odd? About yourself, I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Odd...? Well, my wounds aren't fully healed, but that's not all that strange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Told you! You should be lying down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>You do realize...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>That you were killed, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Huh? I-I mean, they tried, but I'm alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Your body...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>It is dead. You are already dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>She's...dead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>It would have taken some truly elaborate and refined magic. Forcing a soul to rejoin its lifeless body... Only a truly skilled Mage could accomplish such a feat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>H-hold on a second...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>It is not your physical body that is animate, but rather, the soul inside you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>H-hold it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Your bodily functions will gradually deteriorate. First will come a loss of the senses, such as taste and touch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Eventually, both your mind and your body will come to a standstill, your soul will depart, and you will die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>S-stop! Just stop talking for a second!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>What...is this nonsense?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>I know that the truth must be difficult for you to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>What you are saying cannot possibly be true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Does that... Does that mean that her wounds won't...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Her body's healing capabilities have been drastically reduced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>N-no! I...! I'm...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>It is good to see that you are all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Good?! Exactly what part of this is good?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Does she look all right to you?! You... It's your fault that Lofia—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Why was Lofia attacked, then?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>That matter...is currently under investigation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>You killed Lofia! It was all you lot! You're all to blame!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>I-I'm...! I'm still alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Are you sure you didn't sense it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Ngh... N-no...! Not really... Not at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Very well. Perhaps we might have something spicy for now, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Where do you keep all those pickles, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Would you like some?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Hmmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Yes, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Hmhm. Here you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Umgf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>How are they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>They're not spicy anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Nnngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Lofia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Aggghhhhh! I-I can't... I can't walk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>She is unlikely to ever regain the stamina that she once had.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Is this an aftereffect of the time leap?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Th-that's... There's no way! It's...impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Lofia...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Umgf... Mmff... You need sugar for energy... Umgf... So I brought everything I could carry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>I've got cookies, cream puffs, tarts, brioche... They're a little squishy, but they're still good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Umgf... Mmff... Umgf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>It's impossible. There's no way. There's just no way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Lofia... Stop. Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Th-there's no way...they could possibly taste...any less delicious...than they always have...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Lofia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>I taste...nothing. No sweetness at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>Cheryl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Courage, I'm sorry, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Look outside!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Wh-what is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>It's snowing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>It never snows in Redington. It wasn't even cold today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Umgf... Mmff... Umff... Umgf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Umgf... Ahh!</td>

<tr>

<td>Haaaa...haaaa...haaaa... Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Wh-where...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Wh-where is Lofia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>Arghh! The ground is freezing cold! I-is this...ice?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>The store is frozen over! What the heck?! What in blazes is goin' on here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>That girl...! What is she doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>Get away from her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>You killed her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
