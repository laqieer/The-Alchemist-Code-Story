<td>Not good! Victor, hurry up with the evacuation of the citizens!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ack! How could they launch an attack over such a short period of time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's not just their unified leadership...their capabilities are on a whole other level!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh...?! Yikes! Commander Chloe, we're surrounded!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh dear! Victor, dodge it!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh...?! Wh-whoa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Uh...? H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It seems like we're destined to be together, little frog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Basheeny...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Dyaaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Pay attention to the walls as well, Chloe. Their swords can easily pierce the average wall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The situation is more serious than expected. Still, don't worry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>From here you have the support of us the 2nd Regiment. Let's reverse the tide of this battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Y-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hurrah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Captain Monzein the Great Thunder Axe has joined us. He has the strength of 100 men! Look out, you scum of Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That being said...I get it when it comes to the little frog, but I'm surprised to see someone as adept with the sword as you being chased into a corner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Do you think they're using prototypes again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Prototypes...? Oh, you mean that immortal warrior?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I knew it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We'll find out the details ourselves. You did well here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You've managed to successfully merge with the Scarlet Flame Guard. It's your duty to report that to Kanon, right? Come on, go on then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh...?! Wait, hold on! My duty is to intercept Greed Dike along with the 2nd Regiment...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There's no need for that anymore. We've got enough help here. Go on and get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Are you still...upset about my past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Of course I am, idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Spies are the lowest of the low. Fighting by your side goes against my code of chivalry! Now leave!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I told you, that was in the past! I've chosen to believe in Commander Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Shut up! Get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Seriously, I can't believe Kanon. Why would she send a guy like that with me?! I can't even focus on battle with someone who's such a liability lurking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hmph! Who are you calling a liability?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm talking about you possibly betraying me to Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Are you gonna say that to my face?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Tsk... No matter how much I try to explain it to him, he doesn't even attempt to listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This is why I hate working with people! You stupid boar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I heard that! I heard that just now! You called me a stupid boar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but I follow Commander Kanon's orders not yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What did you say?! You scum!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Commander Chloe...he seems to be upset over something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>U-um...right now isn't the time for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ugh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>H-here they come! Those immortal creatures!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Stay away! They're not people you can stand up against!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Just as you say, they're special beings. Leave this to me please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Idiot! How can I leave it to the likes of you! Stand back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Banishment!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Lightning Axe!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Whoa?! Th-that's impressive! You blew those immortal creatures away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Is that...Captain Monzein?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes! The 2nd Regiment of the Holy Guard has come as backup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You scum! I told you not to get in my way! Didn't you hear me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What are you saying?! Now is obviously not the time for that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>They seem to be fighting about something...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>No...there isn't anyone more reassuring to have as support than Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Captain Vettel! It's been a while. I'm glad to see you're well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You saved us. I appreciate your support from the bottom of my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Not at all. I'm honored to be able to help out an old friend of Captain Cadanova.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Enough with the formal greetings. What is the current situation? Is the royal castle safe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>The thing is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...Captain Vettel!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>That was close! Thanks, Chloe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>These creatures! They're still standing up even after being hit by my attack?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...?! Wait, where's the other one?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Little frog, behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Victor! Run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Wh-wha...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>They're still unfinished products...having not reached their full potential yet. You're lucky they're still capable of dying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...! You...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I am Fung Liu. I am what you call...a completed version of them.</td>
