<td>The Minister sent us here to support the Scarlet Legion. He is very concerned about the situation in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blue Flame Knight</td>
<td>He believes that whatever is happening here is not just a matter that concerns Envylia and Wratharis, but has the potential to change the future of the entire world.</td>

<td>In other words...he does not fully trust us yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blue Flame Knight</td>
<td>It is more likely that he is simply attempting to do whatever he can to prevent war between the countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blue Flame Knight</td>
<td>It is nothing personal. The Minister probably just remembered that as the only recognized knight order in Envylia, this business ought to have fallen under our purview from the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blue Flame Knight</td>
<td>We would be much obliged if you would allow us to lend a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blue Flame Knight</td>
<td>Now then, we shall conduct a search of the area while you take the child back to the village. Soldiers, march!</td>

<td>My, my... They are certainly a well-trained bunch, aren't they? Very impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vett.png" alt="Vettel" height="128"><br>Vettel</td>
<td>Yeah... I can't help but notice all the ways they are our superior in discipline and training. Could we really become a knight order on par with them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vett.png" alt="Vettel" height="128"><br>Vettel</td>
<td>No, I can't think like that. We will prove our worth by completing our mission and showing that we have what it takes to become a fully-fledged knight order.</td>
</tr>

<td>Our only priority must be to stay true to our iron will. We can work out the nitty gritty details later.</td>

<td>Good, you've got your head on straight. Don't forget, there's still plenty for us to do here. Shall we go?</td>
