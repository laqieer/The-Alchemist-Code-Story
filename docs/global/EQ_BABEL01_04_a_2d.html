<td>Nina, did you see where the scary people went after they grabbed the villagers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There's no way they could've gotten very far. We're going after them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The Blue Flame Guard?! What are they doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We are looking for Vettel, Captain of the Scarlet Legion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm here. What have you come here for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The Minister sent us here to support the Scarlet Legion. He is very concerned about the situation in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>He believes that whatever is happening here is not just a matter that concerns Envylia and Wratharis, but has the potential to change the future of the entire world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>In other words...he does not fully trust us yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It is more likely that he is simply attempting to do whatever he can to prevent war between the countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It is nothing personal. The Minister probably just remembered that as the only recognized knight order in Envylia, this business ought to have fallen under our purview from the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We would be much obliged if you would allow us to lend a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Now then, we shall conduct a search of the area while you take the child back to the village. Soldiers, march!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My, my... They are certainly a well-trained bunch, aren't they? Very impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yeah... I can't help but notice all the ways they are our superior in discipline and training. Could we really become a knight order on par with them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No, I can't think like that. We will prove our worth by completing our mission and showing that we have what it takes to become a fully-fledged knight order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Our only priority must be to stay true to our iron will. We can work out the nitty gritty details later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Good, you've got your head on straight. Don't forget, there's still plenty for us to do here. Shall we go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Um... I-if it is possible, could I go with you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No. Go home. You'll just get in the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Heh. Nina, don't be fooled by his tough exterior. He's really just worried about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You... How dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Urk! Um... Th-thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>A-and I'm really sorry about what happened to your father. I'm sorry that he died protecting our people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But, um... I-I think th-that it would be good for us to, um, work harder to understand the humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I... I totally understand how you feel. One of my dearest friends was killed by a human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What are you saying? Are you trying to pick a fight or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>N-no, that's not why I said it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I have come to think that hatred only breeds more hatred. I-I'm trying to break that cycle of mutual destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>M-maybe if the two of us can learn to forgive each other... Maybe the day when therians and humans can live and even laugh together is not too far off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If I have the strength to forgive and break the cycle of hate, I think...I could become like the sun; one who can bring joy to the people of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This kid... Her words are almost the same as what Vettel once said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Not all therians are as close-minded about the humans as the village chief. I mean...not everyone agrees with me, either...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>B-but...I was really relieved when you all came, a-and I really hope that I can be of use to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I know it must be strange coming from someone like me who can't really do anything, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Uh, hello? What are you all just standing around for? The kidnappers and the knights that just passed through here are already starting to go at each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The Blue Flame Guard really works fast, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Let's go. If we wait around any longer, the battle will be over before we even get there. Nina, do not let yourself get separated from us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>U-understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This is...much more intense than I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yeah... We might actually be in over our heads.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hey, come on. Look closely... We are more needed here than you seem to think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Oh, Sir Gerald. Perceptive as always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It's not a trick that I will fall for more than once. Legion! Prepare yourselves for battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What...? We've been surrounded?! No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Vettel, let's go! It's time for the Scarlet Legion to show the world what we are made of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Indeed. Scarlet Legion! Forward!</td>
