<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>The food is not enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That is what I'm saying. It was silly to think we could survive without eating humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wait…Let's first discuss this with Koga. We don't have to solve this alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There's no way my weakened body can be rejuvenated with that slop. Things have gotten difficult for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is just what happens to us when we stop devouring humans…Do you understand what I mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We don't know what harmful effects this diet has had on Kaede either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Maybe it was a mistake joining forces with the humans, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>…Regardless, we should discuss this with Koga. If anybody can come up with a solution, it's him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You once said it isn't wise to continue fighting humans if we care about the demon race.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Koga will think of something… I'm sure of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Nothing… It's just you seem to put a lot of faith in him, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Of course I do… Thanks to him, Kaede is able to live a normal life, something I was never able to give her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Besides, I saw with my own eyes--he is an honorable man, worthy of my trust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So, you're trusting a human?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I can't say I trust humans completely… But Koga is different. That's all I'm saying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What should I have expected…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You are still much too shortsighted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ignorance is not a crime, but it is certainly foolish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Our duty is to eradicate all humans, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You've been seduced by the comfort of peace, forgetting this crucial detail… Your behavior does not befit that of the king's vessel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So…what are you suggesting!? You were the one who said we should join the humans in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes, that's true. I did think so at the time…until I realized something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But I don't think you're ready to hear the truth. I'd better not say…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Quit beating around the bush…Tell me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Do you think you can handle the truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Of course I can! Just spit it out already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>…Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The only way to recount the tragedy of you and your sister, is to start from your childhood--when you were captured by humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That experience had a lasting effect on your psyche, didn't it--making you hate and want to destroy all humans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's true…but what's your point?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The person responsible for capturing you when you were children… That person is--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>None other than the man you call Koga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>…!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Koga…!? It can't be… There's no way…!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>He was a member of an unofficial Wadatsumi organization called the Demon Hunters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Does this fact not change your opinion of him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The Demon Hunters…!? He never said a word of this…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Or course he didn’t. Why would he divulge information that could threaten to disrupt the peace? He was quite meticulous in crafting his story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Outwardly, he advocates for peace, but deep down who knows what he's thinking. Humans cannot change their nature so easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Do you presume to understand the true nature of mankind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>This is merely speculation, but I wouldn't be surprised if Koga was using Kaede for some kind of experiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>…Experiment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Suppose at the time you both escaped, their experiment hadn't born fruit…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It stands to reason that Koga, or someone, would try to finish the job at some point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>…Enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Alas, what bitter irony. The only human you could trust was the very person who put you through hell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>And to think, he plans to make you suffer more…Your tragic tale is quickly becoming a comedy! The fates can be so cruel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I said enough!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Going somewhere?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>…I need to find out whether it's true or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What difference does it make?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>…I want to hear it with my own ears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>And if what I’m saying is true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…Most impressive. It seems he trusts that man a great deal. The wait was worthwhile, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I am grateful for your information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>…Does this Tamba really have the power you claim?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>He is the one fit to become the king's vessel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That explains this elaborate ruse… Rather uncharacteristic a demon, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You must be joking… This was your suggestion in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Your wounds have fully healed, and still--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>It should be no trouble if I devour a few people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>The table has been set… If everything goes according to plan, the birth of the "king" is nigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>We'll have to wait and see if this "experiment" pans out. I'm just here to observe. All--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Is for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Precisely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You're useful to me so long as we share a common interest. I will realize my ambition, mark my words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Demons are the only race worthy of ruling Wadatsumi. That is why we need a vessel worthy of being king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yes, I'll use you to the fullest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Welcome home! You're early--Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>…Kaede.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Tamba…what's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>…Where is Koga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>…Wha--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Tell me where his is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>…What's wrong with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Did you know!? The truth about him--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Let go! I said let go of me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>ANSWER ME!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>…Lower your voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>What in the world has gotten into you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>…Did you know…that Koga was once a member of the Demon Hunters…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>…That he was the one who made us suffer…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>…Tamba.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Did you know…? If so, how could you still be with him…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Tamba, please…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Why didn't you tell me? Don't tell me you've forgiven them! After everything they've done to us!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Stop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Don't tell me you've forgotten how much we suffered because of those damn Demon Hunters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Just stop it already, Tamba!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>So, the Discarnate Power was telling the truth after all…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>…A bitter irony. The only human I've ever trusted--my sister's husband--is…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...The person we should despise most of all!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>…You're right. It is a bitter irony. At first, I wanted to hate him too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>…Then tell me why!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>It's true that many things were taken from us…but…we weren't the only ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Koga had his childhood stolen from him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>…What does that have to do with us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Nothing. But...I listened to his story anyway…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>It's not like I could let go of the hatred all at once…but everyday we spent together, I felt my heart start to change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>…Because of his passion for cooking and the time we spent together, I learned about the man he is now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>That's why…I chose to stay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>It's all a facade. Man cannot change his nature so easily. The chasm between demons and humans is too vast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Are you saying…you won't accept my decision?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>This has nothing to do with choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Tamba.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I'm going back--to the place where you belong. There's no use staying here any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>…I belong here. I want to protect the life I've built.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>…Kaede!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>…Why can't you understand? I'm…Ah...*pant*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Kaede!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>…It's nothing…I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>It sure doesn't seem that way to me! Don't tell me--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>You've exhausted your life force?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>…Kaede!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>…I'm eating plenty. But without my horns…and after giving birth to my children--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>…Kaede!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>This is just what happens to us when we stop devouring humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>This is merely speculation, but I wouldn't be surprised if Koga was using Kaede for some kind of experiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>..!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>…Tamba?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>…Ah--AHHHHHHHH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>…Tamba.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>The only way to restore your weakened state is to devour humans…If you stay with Koga any longer--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>…You'll die. There's no escaping it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>…I'm sure Koga will think of something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>How can you put so much faith in that man? For him, you're just--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>If you do anything to hurt Kaede, I'll kill you… Do you hear me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>…Loud and clear! I promise I'll take care of her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Is he still making the same old meals, even seeing you in this state? Does he not understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>The most important thing right now is for humans and demons to remain united. You know that, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Is that a good enough reason for you--for you to be in this condition…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>He--Koga is depriving you of what you need…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>I…trusted him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>...He gave me his word!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>…Tamba?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>…I can't forgive him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>…I'll never forgive him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>…!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>…Tam...ba?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
