<td>002</td>
<td>I'm sure you are aware, but the creation of a Philosopher's Stone is a severe breach of the Magna Code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Did you really think changing your identity would be enough to evade the eyes of the Inquisition and continue your research?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Silence! The completion of my research would have been an unprecedented advancement for this world! That should be the ambition of all researchers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Chief Decel! You understand, don't you?! Don't you see the importance of my work?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's true, the production of Philosopher's Stones would open the door to unimaginable power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But that is why it's dangerous. It could incite wars among nations. Are you willing to shoulder the burden of that responsibility?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Th-that's not my problem! I can't be held accountable for the actions of politicians!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I have to disagree. Our research brings about the development of technology, and therefore paves the way for this continent's future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We are responsible for that future. Isn't that why this job is exciting and worth the effort?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I now see your dignity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Nothing. Take him away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We are finished with our inspection. I apologize for any inconvenience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yeah, there was a lot of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You barged into my laboratory, halted my research, and caused me such a headache.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But...had he successfully produced a Philosopher's Stone, I can't imagine what would have happened to my lab.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Couldn't you have told me you were investigating him specifically?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I believe a research facility like this, dedicated to revolutionary advancements in technology, would accept my unconventional theories and research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's... That's the statement of purpose he wrote when applying for this job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>According to our investigation, he was extremely interested in your research. Said something about how he felt kinship to your point of view.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Somehow, I'm not flattered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Regardless, he misinterpreted your sense of responsibility. Sooner or later he would have shown his true nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Responsible for this continent's future, eh? An arrogant and overconfident statement if I ever heard one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You have a problem with that? We researchers have to have some confidence in our work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No, no problem at all. We can't be shortchanging the children by compromising their future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But remember this: if you ever go against the Magna Code, I will not hesitate to hunt you down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I will be strict. I will be pitiless. Without order today, there is no future for anyone tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...I should be on my way. I've already spent too much time on this case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yeah, don't ever come back. Well, as an Inquisitor, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>U-um...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Thank you for saving me the other day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Decel told me all about you! How you look really scary but you're actually really nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We should have a staring contest sometime! I bet I can make you laugh, mister!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Mister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Mister... Heh...</td>
