<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>That's when Setsuna saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Whoa! That's so cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I think the way Macherie saved me after I collapsed right after that is a lot cooler, personally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That was only possible because you saved me first, Setsuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You're so awesome, Setsuna! You're not even scared of a giant monster bird!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's not true at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Do you think I can protect my sister if I become as strong as you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Jayme...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yeah. As long as you make sure to train hard, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I promise I'm gonna be so strong that you won't ever have to worry, Sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmhm. Thank you, Jayme.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Strong enough that you'll never have to worry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Setsuna...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's nothing. Anyway, shouldn't you be going soon, Macherie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh my! Look at the time! I need to get to the shrine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Don't be in too much of a rush. Be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm fine. I may not be able to see, but I still know where I'm going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Thank you for looking out for me, Setsuna. Hmhm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, it's just that I'm always the one looking after Jayme, so it feels a little strange to be the one being told to be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh... Do the other villagers not worry for you? I mean, considering how special you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No, not really. I usually just go to the nearby desert on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It helps me with my shrine maiden apprenticeship. I'm still a simple novice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I see... Well, don't let me keep you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Right! I should head out! Please watch over Jayme while I'm gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm going now, Jayme. You listen to Setsuna, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Okay! See you later, Sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>These two are so strong. It's their powerful bond that keeps them strong, and so...bright.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I know that coarse, abrasive taste of failing to protect someone important to me. That despair, like sinking into the darkest abyss...</td>
