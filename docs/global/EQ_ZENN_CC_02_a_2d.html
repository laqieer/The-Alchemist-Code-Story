<td>My existence is akin to the quick-drawn blade. I am always stationed where I am needed, and there I wait, like a sheathed blade, for my target to appear. The moment they do, I draw my katana, and with their swift death, I retreat. It is a skill that ensures my survival.</td>

<td>Distance and positioning are everything in Iai.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>Being able to perceive the exact distance at which you can strike your enemy without being in reach of their attacks enables you to cut them down the moment you unsheathe your sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>Of course, enemies who are aware of this technique are unlikely to get too close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/naju.png" alt="Na Zhu" height="128"><br>Na Zhu</td>
<td>Because they know you'll kill them before they can so much as touch you, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>This is how Iai creates the ultimate ideal for suppressing an enemy without drawing one's blade. Hence, victory is won in the sheath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/naju.png" alt="Na Zhu" height="128"><br>Na Zhu</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/naju.png" alt="Na Zhu" height="128"><br>Na Zhu</td>

</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>D. Lily. As in, daylily. Also known as the ditch lily. In the morning they bloom, and by evening they wilt. They only last a single day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>A somewhat derisive nickname for someone whose targets, once marked, do not survive the night. It doesn't suit you. It's too sweet and fanciful.</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Is this how you plan to appease your troubled conscience?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Or is it simply because I am a shrine maiden of Wadatsumi? Am I just another curiosity that piques your interest, like that katana of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>The only nation Wadatsumi is currently willing to open its doors to is Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Indeed. Greed Dike is Wadatsumi's sole ally in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>One only has to look at you to see the extent to which our two nations have grown close and exchanged cultures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>But I don't understand. Why would Wadatsumi send over a human being among their trade goods—and a shrine maiden, at that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsu</td>
<td>Your country paid a princely sum for me, so I hear. This is to save my family, who lost everything to the fires of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D. Lily</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You can keep your sympathies, thank you. I have no need for pity over a matter that is already decided.</td>
