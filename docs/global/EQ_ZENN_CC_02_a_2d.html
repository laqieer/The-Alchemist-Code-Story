<td>001</td>
<td>I made it out of that one by the skin of my teeth, huh? Come to think of it, I'm surprised I have any teeth left!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>From the moment I first saw you, I knew you were someone worthy of my respect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The image of you fighting tooth and nail against impossible odds, all to save my pathetic hide, is burned into my retina for all eternity!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The star of Greed Dike, the father of Imperial Security...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Leader of the Intelligencers... D. Lily. Getting to work with you is the happiest moment of my life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't you remember me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm afraid not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I've protected the royal family many a time, but I've had few opportunities to work with general infantry before, and...I can't quite place you. Sorry to disappoint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Not at all! This is wonderful! It must be because you've created so many corpses that distinctions between living and dead have become blurred! Marvelous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>However, sir... If I may ask one thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I-it had better not be the same question as before. I-I'm on a mission, here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, but it is! Why don't you draw your sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I-I just did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You declare yourself before the enemy, but when they draw their sword on you, you leave yours sheathed. Now, why is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>In the school of Iai, we say, "Victory is won in the sheath."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Iai? Ahh, that's a Wadatsumi sword technique, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Why is your weapon of choice a katana, anyway? There must be plenty of other options for a soldier of Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Th—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Come to think of it, how much is a tool from the island home of demons worth? Was it very expensive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>C-could you give me a second to answer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh! My apologies. I have yet to master the art of conversation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The spirit of Iai resonates with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh? Does this go back to "victory is won in the sheath"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>My existence is akin to the quick-drawn blade. I am always stationed where I am needed, and there I wait, like a sheathed blade, for my target to appear. The moment they do, I draw my katana, and with their swift death, I retreat. It is a skill that ensures my survival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Distance and positioning are everything in Iai.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Being able to perceive the exact distance at which you can strike your enemy without being in reach of their attacks enables you to cut them down the moment you unsheathe your sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Of course, enemies who are aware of this technique are unlikely to get too close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Because they know you'll kill them before they can so much as touch you, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This is how Iai creates the ultimate ideal for suppressing an enemy without drawing one's blade. Hence, victory is won in the sheath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Sounds like the perfect skill for an assassin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So, by executing one's enemy the second they step too close, you avoid any risk of personal injury.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Genius! A skill worthy of our noble nation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I didn't learn it for the country. I learned it for the job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh? What's that look for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Come on, spit it out. What's eating at you? How can you look so positively gloomy when you have such a fun job?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Greed Dike Royal Castle, Dynam Dionysus - Dungeon</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I've been wondering...do you only work out of habit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You never relished drawing your katana before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yet now you use the art of Iai, which you mastered for the purpose of achieving victory without unsheathing your katana, to feed your blade more blood than ever before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You have greedily absorbed Wadatsumi's traditions—our literature, techniques, even our weaponry—to become a mockery of a samurai.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I hope you are proud of yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Wa—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>To think that you would set out to learn the secrets of the island of demons, only to become a demon yourself. You stand before me a cruel, cold-blooded killer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Bu—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Murderer! Fiendish brute! Demon of avarice! Begone from my midst!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>P-please stop! Sh-shouting at me isn't going to help anything, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>True, but it's hard to resist being scornful when you so brazenly ignore the insult of the very name you've been given.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>My...name? What does my name have to do with anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>D. Lily. As in, daylily. Also known as the ditch lily. In the morning they bloom, and by evening they wilt. They only last a single day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>A somewhat derisive nickname for someone whose targets, once marked, do not survive the night. It doesn't suit you. It's too sweet and fanciful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What is your real name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Unfortunately, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Don't remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I always thought...that holding on to memories would weaken my blade. I don't know my own birthday anymore, and I couldn't pick my parents out from a crowd of strangers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>How awful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Isn't there anything I can do for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Oh. Is that what you came down here to ask me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Is there anything you want? Anything at all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Is this how you plan to appease your troubled conscience?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Or is it simply because I am a shrine maiden of Wadatsumi? Am I just another curiosity that piques your interest, like that katana of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The only nation Wadatsumi is currently willing to open its doors to is Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Indeed. Greed Dike is Wadatsumi's sole ally in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>One only has to look at you to see the extent to which our two nations have grown close and exchanged cultures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>But I don't understand. Why would Wadatsumi send over a human being among their trade goods—and a shrine maiden, at that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Your country paid a princely sum for me, so I hear. This is to save my family, who lost everything to the fires of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You can keep your sympathies, thank you. I have no need for pity over a matter that is already decided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>P-pity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Yes. Keep it to yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I... I thought you were as cold and unfeeling as I was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>How rude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You were so frank about being traded, as if you were a chair or a cabinet, but...now I see your honesty belied your shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I-I'm not trying to insult you. Really. I just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Just what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I just r-realized that, even so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You're...determined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I'm sorry... What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You mentioned...the afterlife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Oh, don't bring that up. How embarrassing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>But, you see, I... I stopped thinking about things like that a long time ago. I gave up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Well, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>We're a sorry pair, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Multifunctional, resilient, flexible, easy to handle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>It's human nature to want a tool like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Since the old king met his end and Emperor Orion claimed the throne, rebel elements have continued to contest his rule at every turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Their roots must run deep to produce so many seeds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>My father was a careless fool who bedded more concubines than he could count, producing dozens of illegitimate heirs. Now these bastards plot to overthrow my rightful rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>And if we allow this unrest to continue, we risk invasion by opportunistic foreign powers, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Yes, but that is also why we must avoid mobilizing our military. There is no faster route for foreign nations to sniff out our weakness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>That's where we come in! As an organization that operates in secret as proxy executors of the state, Imperial Security is best poised to do what needs to be done. We're the fangs of the powerful lion himself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>A new empire shall rise under the lion's mane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>The age of adherence to morals and faith is at an end. Under my rule, people will be moved by strength alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>As such, it only makes sense for the worth of our leaders to be tested regularly, to ensure that they are fit to stand above the rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I was told this was a...training exercise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>And we were told that whoever kills the head of the Intelligencers would be next in line for the position!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>You have my word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You would pit me...against all of our new recruits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>We can do this! There's no way he can take down all of us alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I...don't think this is a good idea. In a pitched battle, I might not be able to hold back. We could lose dozens of new recruits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>So? It's always advisable to do a little sorting when you get new tools, is it not? The same rule applies here. The unworthy should be weeded out post-haste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Exactly. Couldn't have put it better myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I thought you might say that, my lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I want you to think of yourself as a blacksmith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I know nothing of forging swords...only swinging them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I did not mean it literally. Put it this way: Na Zhu is a quality hunk of iron ore. It is the work of a blacksmith to temper quality ore, and forge quality weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>And who better suited to fulfill that role than you, D. Lily? You are my silent dagger, my most utile tool, and now also the blacksmith who will hone my iron pawns into warriors of steel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I want you to train me. You will, won't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I want to be like you! A tool who serves the emperor! A glorious annal in the history of this proud nation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>You, too, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Unlike you, I have no means of changing my course. I am but a sacrifice, a good to be traded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>(Why do you long to become a tool?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Come, rise and fight, brethren!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Fulfill your duty, my daylily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Like a surrendered blade, I have no will of my own. I am fated only to be carried from place to place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>(Why do you cling so to your blindfold?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>And so the katana is fed to the flame! Among crimson fire it's reborn again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Uh-oh. There goes that gloomy look again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>This fight is pointless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>You mean you don't think you can win?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Oho. He's trying to rattle you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I don't think I can win without killing you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Still, perhaps in the next life, at least, I'll have a chance to begin anew. What do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>The flame is yet small, like a candlewick glare, yet who can say what will provoke it to flare?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>(If there is a way to do things over, I...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>A single droplet of frost upon the vessel drips! It is all I can see—the vision has me in its grips!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>If you take one more step, I'll cut you down where you stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Hmm... Do you think there is an afterlife awaiting me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>(I hope I find it.)</td>
</tr>
