<td>Saga region. Near the Wind Temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...So this is the settlement of the wind tribe-the resting place of the final Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But...what is this? There appears to be no sign of human life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hey, how about you say something? I wouldn't mind burning down this entire landscape if I have to, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Are you an idiot? With all the commotion you've been causing, anyone would get a wind of what's going on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The Alize people that live around here are the people that Seida grew up with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>They're a tribe that's gifted in their ability "read the wind" and perceive what is going on around them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You blast your way forward with no regard for your surroundings. I'd be more surprised if they hadn't picked up on you approaching.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So you're saying they've fled? Tsk. Anyway, let's head to that temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's pointless. Seida's tribe is an astute one. I highly doubt they've left any tracks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That may not be the case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>In fact...there's plenty of chance they may have left the Matter behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Listen to how quiet it is. Do you really think they've left the Matter here on its own? Of course not...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There's a basis for my argument. Until now, each faction has kept their Matter in their temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Most likely, they were all aware of my approach...yet they kept it in such an obvious place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>There may be some reason why they have to store their Matter in these temples.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's just wishful thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Say whatever you want. Anyway, let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I can't afford to waste time here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You've got to be kidding me. We've come this far. I won't let this opportunity escape me now. I'm going to find it all costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The blue landscape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's what you said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You told me that you were looking for a sky like this-a beautiful deep, blue landscape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What did you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why are you asking me now? What good would that information do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What good...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If I understand your reasoning, we might be able to find a way to co-exist, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>There may be another way that doesn't result in unnecessary casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Understand? That's impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You can't ask someone to sing when they've never heard music before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You've lived peacefully in this world. There's no way you'd understand what it feels like to live at the bottom rung of the ladder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Of course, I won't...not unless you take the time to explain it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Can you imagine a life where your very existence is a crime?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Lost Blue is a city built by those who have fled their pursuers from all across the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If we were to try and express our existence, our pursuers would catch wind of us and our livelihoods would be destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Those who live there have no choice but to deny their own existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>In that dark underground, neither the beautiful sky or the ocean exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>As you can guess, in such an environment, obtaining food is no easy matter. Constant hunger and strife are daily occurrences there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What exists in that place is envy and resentment towards those above the ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It is a colorless world where nothing but negative feelings swirl through the air.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That is the land where you were born and raised...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yes. I believe that Lost Blue's current way of existence is wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The hopeless environment is one created by our predecessors who continued to neglect and flee from reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The people of Lost Blue have abandoned all hope. I want to lead them to the light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The light...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>However, pipedreams alone will change nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>In order to truly lead them to the light, it is necessary to have power-enough power to overwhelm the forces above ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>So that's why, like Orion, you're also seeking the founders of Alchemy...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The founders of Alchemy...? You underestimate my ambition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'll ask you again: do you believe there is only one reality that exists?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The founders of Alchemy...they're just one embodiment within this small world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>This world is just one amongst many. There is an equal amount of realities in existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...? What are you talking about? Are you saying that the founders' power isn't the one you are looking for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Indeed. The immense power I seek...you might even call it the origin of the founders of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That power undoubtedly lies beyond that tower which leads to another dimensional layer. I am certain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Which tower? Are you talking about the Tower of Babel in Northern Pride?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>No. It's similar, yet exists in another dimension. It is a distant tower that cannot be seen by the naked eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The people of Lost Blue call this tower Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Veda...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...The summit of the tower has still not manifested itself yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>In order to make the summit visible and, thus, obtain immense power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>A considerable amount of Alchemic energy is required...energy comparable to that of the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Is that why...you're collecting the Matter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You could say that. Although, if I were to take my time, eventually I should gain access to the summit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>However, with the Sacred Stone or the Matter's Alchemic energy, this could be achieved without wasting any time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>In other words, we could reach the summit immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>So...that's why you're serving under Greed Dike in their search for the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Hey, hold on. Just so you're clear, we don't serve under them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>We were originally searching for Slothstein's Sacred Stone, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>We couldn't seem to find it anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>That's when Orion approached us with talk about the Matter's existence. He informed us that its power was comparable to the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>We merely took on this mission on the basis of receiving the Matter as a reward. We're equal partners in this venture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>As a reward...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>For starters, the Matter doesn't belong to Greed Dike! It belongs to the tribes of Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>None of that really matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Come on. We go to the Wind Temple. If the Matter has been left there then this will all be over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It will be the end of all our troublesome problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>So...ultimately, this was all to fulfill your own desires. You're like a child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Are you telling me that Captain Monzein and all the tribesmen and tribeswomen were desecrated for the sake of appeasing a child like you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Seida!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>So...you're Seida, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You can try to dress up your actions as much as you like. Either way, what you and your people have done is unforgivable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>With this bow...I will avenge those who were robbed of their lives!</td>
</tr>
