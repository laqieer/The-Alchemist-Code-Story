<td>What's the matter--can't attack? Put up a fight or you're going to die!</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>…The thing is…if it'll make you feel better, I've got to just take it.</td>

<td>I heard the horrors of what you and Kaede went through… If you don't let this out now, we might never be able to move forward.</td>

<td>So, give me all you got. I can take it. So long as--</td>

<td>It seemed as if their days would be forever spent in idyllic bliss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But the longer there is peace, the more shadows begin to creep in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Their lofty vision had become the norm and conflict was now the exception.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Times like these are when "evil" most often appears.</td>
