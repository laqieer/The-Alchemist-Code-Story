<td>002</td>
<td>Oh dear...it seems like we messed up on our estimation a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>In fact...it's best to assume that the transmission of information has been delayed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Was it Lord Waginau?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's my guess, but there's no point in speculating. Come on. Let's go, Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>H-hey, hold on! The scale of Greed Dike's army is completely different than what we were told...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't worry. Our backup will come eventually. We just have to hold on a little longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That being said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's true that Greed Dike's soldiers...especially the combat level of their special assassin forces, are far more advanced in comparison to the army of other countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That being said, they're still human. There are ways for them to be conquered...although there are exceptions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Exceptions...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You've heard, haven't you? About the prototypes that are separate from ordinary humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The immortal soldiers...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Speak of the devil...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>B-bugs?! Giant bugs?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ack! If you're gonna call yourself immortal, then tell me that after you've been on the receiving end of my Kagutsuchi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>H-h-hey! Hold on a sec! No! Those are the villagers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Amongst the men in Lustburg, there are those who've been turned into insects!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You've heard about it, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You're so dangerous! You almost attacked the villagers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry. It's the first time I've seen them properly...but...what do you mean by the prototypes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well, just watch. Piercing Light!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Aghhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...! When did that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You have to keep your guard up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ug...ghh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No way. You obviously hit its vital points.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Like I said, they're immortal. No wonder the soldiers of Lustburg are having so much trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...Ugghhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>C-Captain Othima! Here they come! Now isn't the time to be showing off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Calm down, calm down. Ill Atmosphere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Aghh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...! It stopped?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>See? They become troublesome if you try to kill them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>As long as you just stop their movements, they're no trouble at all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Guugggaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah. The best they can do is go on moaning...agh?! Another one?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Kagutsuchi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Whoa?! No way...it disappeared?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's too cumbersome to stop their movement. I prefer to use Kagutsuchi and eliminate them completely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Seriously. Why are the girls in our Guard so strong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh, nothing! Yeah, let's go with that. Do however you please, Kagura! In any case, let's split up and evacuate the villagers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>On second thought, sorry, I take back my words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Look at that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...! Smoke coming from the castle?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It seems like they've arrived at the castle. I'll go from the other direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Kagura, you meet up with the royal army and intercept the Greed soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Understood. Once I've finished there, I'll also head immediately to the castle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Please be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Come on. I'll be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Still, right back at you. We've no idea what tactics they might use. I forbid you from overdoing it, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>All right. Off with you then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Honestly. She really does do whatever she pleases.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Now that war has been declared, we'll have to take full responsibility for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Ultimately, it's you who'll regret it in the end...Lion Monarch Orion!</td>
