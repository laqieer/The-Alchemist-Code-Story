<td>Asena...will fall at the hands of Georgios? That must be prevented at all costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'll head immediately to Asena! Mocca, you come with...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wait, Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's not a good idea to let your emotions get the better of you. There's no guarantee that Georgios will act immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I...I know that! But...we cannot afford to lose Asena! Is there...is there no other way?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>First, we should save that village that has been attacked, then we should head to Tehre. I believe that would be the most efficient way to protect Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We don't have time to think about efficiency!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Georgios could act at any time. So our top priority is to make the Sprite Trio Discourse a reality and quickly restore the Wind Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I know...but...argh...isn't there something else I can do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...?! Whuff...arff...yuff...duffing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What are you doing?! Now isn't the time to be playing around and pinching my cheeks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Have you calmed down? I understand why you're impatient. I also understand that we don't have time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's why we must think calmly. We are currently shouldering the future of Saga. We cannot let temporary emotions get the better of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes...you're right. I'm okay now. Thank you for always helping me, Mocca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Let's go over what we need to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Right now, it is unlikely that Georgios is headed to Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>After he raided the Fuu village, he withdrew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Given that their base appears to be Port Nahema, even if they had made their way immediately, we still have time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In that case, it may be most efficient to make your way to Tehre as a messenger while simultaneously surveying the movements of the Gluttony army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Isn't there a possibility that, in the meantime, Georgios will be making his way to Asena?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>In such a case, leave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I swear on my honor as one of the Sprite Trio that I will stop him. I will remain here and remain on the alert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Voda...! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I haven't seen the vision myself, so I cannot judge your feelings, Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But that's all the more reason why I want to fight by your side! In order to prevent that future, we must do everything we can right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes! Well then, let's first head to the village that asked Voda for help. Let's save as many people as we can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'll be depending on you. With my power now devoted to managing the Matter, I feel encouraged by your presence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>However, I swear that my heart is with you all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Well then, I will return the Matter first and prepare the letter of summoning for the discourse. I'll leave the rest to you all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Tina! I know you might feel anxious, but...you can rely on me more! I'll help you with all my strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Lisbeth...thank you. I'm sorry for involving you even though you're not a citizen of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Donâ€™t worry about it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I still have the matter of Lustburg's curse to deal with. Besides, I can't just stand around and do nothing while people are suffering in front of my eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'll leave this to you. Tina...I'm sure everyone here right now feels the same. It's all for the future of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes! I leave now, Voda!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well then, let's hurry to the village! Both of you, keep your guard up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Glurrrrrppp!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wow! What numbers...! We need to hurry to the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The top priority isn't to destroy them, but to reach the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If we calmly deal with them, there shouldn't be any problem! Don't be misled by their numbers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>All right! Let's hurry! We need to save as many people as possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You're right. I...we need to protect the people of Saga. Now isn't the time to be rushing into matters alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Everyone, thank you! I'm going to rely on your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Tina...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I...need to save all of Saga, no matter what the future holds...I will change it all! After all, I'm not alone!</td>
</tr>
