<td>Othima, you lack the awareness befitting a knight. Do you ever consider the consequences of your own actions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>During the previous mission, you completely ignored the agreed-upon strategy, and as a result our ranks fell apart. Normally, you would be disciplined for such misconduct.</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So that's why you punished me with combat drills instead of sticking me up in front of the committee, huh? Well, this has been great, but I—</td>

<td>You're not done yet. One more round!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>No, thanks. Unless you're planning on paying me overtime?</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A true paladin isn't motivated by financial gain.</td>

<td>Ugh. Spare me your idealism.</td>

<td>Quick question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Sure, I could work all day, but if my inner equilibrium starts to crumble, who's going to pick up the pieces? You ever think about that?</td>

<td>What sort of justice would that be, huh? Who's that gonna save?</td>

<td>Excuse me?</td>

<tr>

<td>You haven't given a single one of my strategies a shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But what would a rookie like me know, right? Guess I shouldn't have bothered with all those late-night strategy sessions, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I was different, too. According to some, I was out of my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I wanted to become a light that would illuminate this world, right down to its darkest corners. But a vague goal like that wasn't getting me anywhere.</td>

<tr>

<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hmm... This book is very informative. I should make some notes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Shh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>"Make sure you listen to your subordinates. Be attentive and empathetic. Never interrupt them, or reject their side of the story without listening to it first." Whoops... I'm guilty of that one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Excuse me, could you please be quiet while you're in the archives? This is meant to be—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'd better write this down, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Could you please—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>"Is there light within you?" Y-yes! This book really speaks to me. I've got to write that down—this is excellent material.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Would you please keep it d—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>"The light within our hearts is our greatest treasure. Cultivate your light, for the brighter it becomes, the more fulfilling your life will be. Many brilliant and glorious days with your peers await you..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>This is literary gold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What is with this guy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>"A warm smile is most effective when dealing with those who are reluctant to open their hearts or speak their minds."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>A smile? I should practice. Teeth, or no teeth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Bam!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>And... smile!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>How's this guy still smiling after getting a book thrown at him?! I don't even think he noticed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Aha! It answers my question here: "Lift the corners of your lips and show your teeth. Remember to always make eye contact when you smile." I guess it's more like this, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Have another!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>This feels right... Cheese!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>How many books do I have to hit him with before he notices me?! It's like he's made of stone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I should write this down, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Aaaahhh! Where did you come from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Shh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>O-oh! Right. Sorry, I'll try to keep it down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Did you need something, sir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I... Ahem. Nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Surely you've seen your fair share of serving girls, noble paladin? You should have no reason to stare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>M-my apologies. It's just... I didn't realize the archives even had a caretaker—and I don't believe we've met.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Come to think of it, why did you bother coming all the way out here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Whatever it is you're looking for, you'd have a much better selection in the knight-appointed Grand Library, I'm sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I-I wanted to be alone... away from prying eyes. This place is nice and quiet, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>In other words, you figured you'd be alone because there's nothing here but old books no one has a use for anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>And because nobody in their right mind would come to this moldy old broom closet when they have a much nicer option. Does that sound about right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I-I, um... Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>And I'm sure it wouldn't have mattered to you if a lone archivist saw what you were doing. In your mind, you were as good as alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>L-look, let me help you tidy up these—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>That won't be necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>We can't have you getting your fancy clothes all dirty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It's my fault they're all over the place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I couldn't possibly burden our future Lord Commander with such a trifle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>But you're happy to throw books at my head?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>That's your fault, for being so grating on the ears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I'm sorry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>It wasn't a great first meeting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>All your muttering. It was painful to listen to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Do you remember it as well as I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Ahem. That was rude of me. Begging your pardon, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You were always so full of resentment; quietly smoldering away in that dimly lit place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Seeing that, I found myself wishing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>What's your name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>That I could find a way to shine some light upon the darkness that surrounded you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Why are you asking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>How did you come to be here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Why do you want to know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Are you going to answer every question I ask with another question?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Do you interrogate everyone you meet like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Are you going to ask if there's light within me next?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Books can't tell you everything, you know. Besides, you don't really care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>You showed me just how poor I was at conveying my own feelings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>It's all nonsense, anyway. Light like that doesn't exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>You helped me realize how passive I was being, failing even to light my own darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Hello, Lord Commander-To-Be. What are you doing in a place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Greetings, Vice-Captain Kaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>There's no need for that. That title doesn't feel like me at all... Though I can't say I hate it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I believe I just asked you the same question. I've got some research to do, if you must know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Ohh... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Well, well, well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Could you do me a little favor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>My resignation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I was jealous of Kaya, for being so capable of honestly expressing her feelings. That's why I was always lost for words when it came to changing her mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Deliver it for me, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I didn't want anyone to notice my shortcomings. So I put up a bold facade in front of my subordinates, and took great pains to look good in front of my peers. It was all born of vanity—envy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>These burdens were so heavy, I couldn't cope alone. You were the only one I could turn to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Huh? You're asking me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I... suppose I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Your worries are way too abstract. I don't see how I'm supposed to be any help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>You're one greedy guy, you know that? Trying to get others to explain things you don't even understand yourself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>G-greedy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>You come at me with no specifics, no ideas of your own, no consideration. I don't believe for a moment that you're even the least bit motivated to figure this out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>And to top it all off, you're turning to a lowly serving girl for aid? That's not just pathetic, it's ridiculous! Do you do all your consulting with the help? Who do you turn to for financial advice—the kitchen staff?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Do you talk to your plants, too? Let me guess—this is all just a little game to make you feel superior to me, isn't it? Well, if it is, go ahead and give yourself a pat on the back—you've done it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I mean, it has to be a joke—though it's not a very funny one. You don't know the first thing about me, yet you're trying to "light up my life"? Give me a break!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I didn't meant to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>It's bad enough that you don't even seem to realize how presumptuous your way of thinking is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Wh-what do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Do you really think that chasing off the darkness is enough to save people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>I'm sure wanting to light up the world is a very noble mission, but who are you doing it for? What areas will you target? And how do you plan on going about any of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>You can't answer any of those questions, yet you still go around spouting your intentions like you've got it all figured out. It's the very height of arrogance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Arrogance...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>If you're offended by my words, or feel that I am out of line, then go ahead and punish me—but I won't take back anything I've said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Because whatever you may think, it's reckless to go on about lighting up the world when you don't know the first thing about it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Besides... it's not like it's possible, anyway. Not everyone can bask in your saving light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Forget about it. I'm leaving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Your name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>You still haven't told me your name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Why do want to know so badly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>I want to call you by name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>I just... really want to know. I want to understand you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>You're so simple-minded...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Hm... I suppose I have been a bit presumptuous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>A bit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>And... smile!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Wh-what are you grinning at me like that for?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>"A warm smile is most effective when dealing with those who are reluctant to open their hearts or speak their minds." I... read that in a book.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Hah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>"Lift the corners of your lips and show your teeth. Remember to always make eye contact when you smile." It's in my notes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Haha. You're such a weirdo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>P-perhaps... but it worked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>It got you to talk to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Gosh, you're annoying to listen to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>You called me greedy. Presumptuous. Arrogant. Reckless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>You're giving me a headache.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>And you were right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Oh? Is this my farewell party?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Northern Pride (Reminiscence of a Memory)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>What? Didn't you deliver my resignation letter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>The Lord Commander rejected it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Darn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Don't lose hope, Kaya. Just hang in there a little longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Hm? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>When I become Lord Commander, I'll create an environment where you'll be free to quit anytime you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>I'll perfect the Holy Guard to the point that even the Church's top brass will accept your resignation without question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Hmhm. I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Already planning how we're going to abuse our authority, are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>I'm going to bring light to the people of this world, one at a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Uh-oh. Somebody doesn't know how to keep their public and private affairs separate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Of course, my topmost priority will always be achieving peace for the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Sounds exhausting. Are you sure you can handle all of that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>You'll see. As Lord Commander, I will author a new chapter in the history of Babel. In fact... perhaps you would consider remaining with us, for a front-row seat by my side from which to observe it all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Ahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Dang, that was smooth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Interesting... But I have my doubts. Prove to me that you have what it takes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>A bout, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>I thought knights of the Holy Guard weren't supposed to fight among themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Consider it a part of your training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Hmhm... Oh, you big, chivalrous fool...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Othima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah. I'm in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Two against one? Really, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>It's the Lord Commander's prerogative to utilize his subordinates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Pfft. Coward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>There'll be no holding back, then. For either of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Yikes. Is it too late to run?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>No time like the present. Let's get this sparring match underway, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Ready, Othima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Nope. How about I quit, instead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>Kaya is exceptional in all she does, it is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>I'm getting closer and closer to drawing up my own letter of resignation here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>If Kaya remains with the Holy Guard, all of our workloads will be lessened significantly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Including yours and mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Will I be able to take a vacation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>Oh, yes. Plenty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>Okay, then I'm back on board!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Since when did you become such a skillful manipulator?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Since I got serious about becoming Lord Commander. I've been working on myself—is it paying off?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Perhaps. It's too early to tell—more observation required.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>And... smile!</td>
</tr>
