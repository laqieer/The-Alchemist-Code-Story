<td>Ack! Ohh, I'm defeated. You've defeated me. Go on ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huff...huff... I-I...don't feel like we won at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The truth is, I heard about you girls wanting to change this country. I wanted to see with my own eyes what you were like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So...you were testing us after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I attempted to stop you as I was ordered to and was defeated. That's all there is to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Now go. I will descend. I hate to work overtime. That being said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Who would've thought there were such students down on the ground. Lisbeth...I heard that you were a bad student at school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh? Oh...yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Without being noticed by any, without shining bright, you were a witch that was quietly looking for a way to make others happy. You sound very similar to the white moon that shines midday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Similar...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'll tell you this, Lisbeth. Just once...I used my own power to go beyond the clouds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What?! A-and...did you find Asmodeus?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I didn't. Perhaps it is not a shining stone. In any case, the clouds were in the way, and I couldn't see it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh dear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Asmodeus continues to look down on this country...without shining and while being hated by its people. You remind me of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I remind you of Asmodeus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>And there is another person who reminds me of this way you live. When you can share that person's resolve and carry the burden...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>When all the people truly seek it, Asmodeus may appear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I wonder if...she's actually a good person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What did she mean in the end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I don't know, but...she decided to let you continue onward, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The witch who has continued to protect the sky entrusted Lustburg to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Rebecca is right. Come on. Let's go. Both of you, hold on tight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Both bitterness and self-interest have been repeated long enough. But those girls are flying above with their eyes on the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Right now, they are still rough diamonds, but, one day, they will shine brightly and illuminate the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I tried to play my part in polishing you. Now shine on your own...Lisbeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What are you doing? We need to hurry on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I know, but I seem to have used up my magic in our fight just now. I can't seem to go up any higher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, we've come to a pretty high place. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Agh... But...we still need to go a little higher!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Don't push yourself, Alma. Let's try. You rest a little—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No...this is my limit. From here, you two continue upward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>No...Alma, you've got to come with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I would've liked to see how it looks above the clouds or what Asmodeus looks like, but I'll just be a burden to the two of you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If only I'd been pulling us up from the start...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You wouldn't have been able to pull two people, right? I was the only one who could've started us off, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Rebecca...this is my final job. I'm sure you'll use it later, so I'll tell it to you now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>There's only one knack: give it everything you have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>This is...Alma Shoooooot!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What brute force!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Alma!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'll leave the rest to you, Liz! Rebecca! Tell me all about what's up above the clouds later!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Of course, Alma!</td>
</tr>
