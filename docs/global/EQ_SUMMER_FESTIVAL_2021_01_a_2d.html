<td>Windchimes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh? Do they sound familiar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, not really. It's not a big deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Just made me a little nostalgic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, I see. They do have a nice sound. Supposedly, they ward off evil spirits of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>There's more than just chimes. They put out these lanterns and float them on the water at the end of the festival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(I never thought I'd see another Wadatsumi festival.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(So the culture spreads, even though we were invaded and abandoned.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(I suppose people always take the convenient path. They find what's fun for them.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(I guess, everyone's like that. Even me...with Button.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ooh! Look at that white fluffy thing! It looks so tasty. Hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>H-Hang on! I'm coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>S-Sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What're you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm so sorry, Sis! Okay, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well, she's got some pep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Seems like they're having a good time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Are those windchimes for me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You seemed hot, so I thought the windchimes might help with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I suppose I do feel a little cooler.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Windchimes are also meant to ward off evil spirits, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If purified by those, then next year we should be able to attend the festival together, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Pfew... I suppose taking a break here would be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I can't believe I've ended up in the mountains looking for someplace quiet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Compared to the mountains in Saga, these aren't that impressive...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(That had been rough going. The footing was bad, and Button fell down a lot. I even tripped once...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What's the matter? You can be so clumsy. Here, take my hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ikasa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I-It's nothing. I'm fine. I can get up on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Come on. It's fine. Take it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No. It's not right for me to lean on the princess I'm meant to protect for support. It isn't knightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(I didn't take your hand then.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(I didn't feel worth helping...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(In the end, you and I...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This is frustrating. This should all be over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Sitting here moping?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I don't think Button will be coming here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What makes you think I'm looking for Button?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Maybe it's because I first met you two in the mountains. It's where I remember you from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ooh, a place of memories?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Is this child with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I guess she is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I thought I might discover something interesting following Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>And I didn't have anywhere in particular to be right now, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but there's nothing interesting in this place. There's nothing to see or anything unusual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>And I'm just someone with too much time on her hands, though it seems pointless now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I can't say I don't understand how you feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It seems an unexpected waste. But if joy was had, then there was meaning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Meaning...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hey, do you hear something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...Why won't this work? The execution should be perfect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Maybe we need more power. If we had...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Then we could perfect this ritual and use its power to enforce our wills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Grave robbers? They're disturbing the bodies of those laid to rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It makes my blood boil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Shall we teach them a lesson?</td>
</tr>
