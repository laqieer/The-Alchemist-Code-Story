<td>Are you all right?! Give me a damage report! Hurry!</td>

<td>Agatha, are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes...father protected me. What about you two?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Somehow. Agh... We were dangerously close to being wiped out completely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>In any case, there's a chance that Sabareta will target Agatha. Focus on protecting her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ye-yes, Sir! But why Agatha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'll explain it to you eventually. More importantly, I'm concerned about what exactly they've unearthed from the ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>For an excavation of that scale, I doubt their aim was to find Philosopher's Stones. I think they were trying to unearth an ancient weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>An ancient weapon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Once, in this continent of Babel, there was a highly advanced civilization, who made full use of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Unfortunately, a dispute occurred amongst the kingdoms that seem to have led to their destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hm. How disappointing. I guess that means that the past isn't much different than the present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Even as technology evolves, the way people think doesn't evolve very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>At the zenith of their evolution, they began producing weapons using the forbidden art.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The main force of power between the kingdoms began to shift to Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Finally, at the end of the fierce conflict between the Alchemists, they produced the ultimate weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>And that was this ancient weapon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. An ancient weapon born out of high-level Alchemy. It ultimately devoured the world in flames.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The introduction of this ancient weapon brought an end to ancient civilization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So you're saying that something that terrible has fallen into Sabareta's hands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>A light of hope that will lead the world into chaos...that's what he said. If he meant the ancient weapon, then that's no pipe dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Captain, we've tracked the Lizard Brigade! They appear to be headed towards Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I see. That doesn't bode well! We leave immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Dad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This was a trap to distract us. Their true aim is Spandau Castle, where the king is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?!</td>
