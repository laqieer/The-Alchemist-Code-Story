<td>They're really good at hiding in the shadows at this late hour. However, I won't let them escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I will find them. All of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If we did that, it would fail to make this a hallmark achievement for the Scarlet Legion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(Why did I say something like that?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Gerald...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What is it now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Your wounds... I still haven't treated them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You really are far too reckless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Gerald? Why did you say what you did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Was your head sparking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What does that have to do with anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Nothing, really. I don't have to analyze you to know that it can't be fixed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Still... I want to do something for you. It hurts to see you like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You're always overdoing it, Gerald.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I can walk by myself on my own two feet, thank you! Put me down right now! You're embarrassing me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Just let me carry you. It's your own fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I had to go all-out if I was going to beat you! I have to do whatever it takes to keep up with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, injuring your leg isn't going to get you anywhere, is it? Vettel went to get the first-aid kit, so I guess that's it for us for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Heheh. Good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What're you snickering about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Aww. Don't be mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's just...you've changed since you started training with Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You've always thought that you were the only one willing to do whatever it takes, no matter how reckless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But Vettel is even more reckless than you are, so your hair keeps sparking like crazy and I don't think it's ever going to stop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You might be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh? Wait... It stopped!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's nothing to worry about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hmm... Maybe if I work harder to study medicine, one day I'll be able to analyze you through dissection and figure you out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If that's a joke, it isn't funny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I might be able to tend to your injuries, but I can't do anything about your sparkiness. A thorough physical analysis is what's called for here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You know, that's not really sounding like a joke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I want to help you, Gerald. So, what do you say? Will you lie down on my operating table, for science?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Hahah. I'm afraid I'll have to pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I won't tell you not to be reckless, or to stay away from the battlefield because you're not a fighter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>We'll always be together, Natalie. You and me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I miss those days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Now you're the one being reckless all the time and I'm the one who has to patch you up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Gerald, let me carry you, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I don't mean physically, you big lump! You're always trying to shoulder your burdens alone, but you don't have to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Let me help you. Let me support you. Let me take some of that weight off of your shoulders and carry it for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Just like how you picked me up and put me on your shoulders that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm not burdened with anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>There you go again, sparking! You can't hide it from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Would it really be so bad to lean on me? Even when I'm standing here, begging you to let me help you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Why can't you just be honest with yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Just...bring me some water, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hmph. Fine! I'll be right back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Strange... She's been gone for quite a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'll do it, whether he asks me to or not! He wants the Scarlet Legion to be famous? Done! Maybe if I make that happen, his head will stop sparking so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Well, I mean, I hope I can cure it like that. Won't know unless I try.</td>
</tr>
