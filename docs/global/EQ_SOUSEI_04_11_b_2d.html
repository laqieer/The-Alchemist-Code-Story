<td>We're...</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We're gonna save Emmel! We're gonna save this region!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I want to make a bright future for all people! I want everyone to be able to smile!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh? Energy is welling up suddenly... I guess it's now or never!</td>

<td>008</td>
<td>Huzzahhhhh!</td>

<td>Grrrroooooaaarrrrgghhh!!!</td>

<td>Yeah, bullseye! So nowâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No, it didn't work? Don't tell me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wait, Adaleigh! What's happening? Nothing we're doing can beat Asmodeus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We can damage it, but nothing will finish it off. Can you analyze it from there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This is the sanctuary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I think that this entire region is already Beelzebub's sanctuary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So those Cursed Beasts are receiving a supply of magil. They can recover in a flash!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Whaaat? You're saying...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Those two have the forms of Asmodeus and Belphegor, but are puppets of Beelzebub!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's just like how the Sinners of the Luxuria Belt were made from Asmodeus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We can't defeat them under these conditions... Even if we did, they'd immediately be revived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We have to defeat Beelzebub and eliminate the sanctuary or it's useless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That means we have to keep fighting Asmodeus until Nimul and the others can beat Beelzebub...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No freaking way! There's nothing else we can do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Let me do the analysis first... Ah, darn! It's being revived again! Sorry, I've got my hands full over here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Wait, Adaleigh! Adaleeeeigh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This is impossible! We'll end up expending all of our energy before this is over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We'll just have to conserve our magil and prepare for the long haul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Seriously? But the Beast can end us in one attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm serious, Mira. Look, Asmodeus is moving again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Eek! Argh, hurry up, Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It looks like Mira and the others are fighting a hard battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I know. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The Sinners' attacks on the village have suddenly gotten stronger. At this rate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The corrupted voices of spirits are coming from so many places!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I've never picked up on these numbers of corrupted before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Eulalia, you feel it too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>There is something very clearly strange here. Perhaps Beelzebub is different from the Cursed Beasts we've encountered before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Nimul! Another horde of Sinners is approaching from the right! Our lines will crumble like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hmm. Focus our power in that direction. I'll cover them! Charge if you find any opening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Are you sure? This will delay our procession...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>There's no other way. But why has it come to this? Every time Sinners have appeared, the people of Sephira have arrived to purify it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But after the awakening of Beelzebub, so many people have fallen into sin; an absurd number...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Where could all these Sinners be coming from?</td>
</tr>
