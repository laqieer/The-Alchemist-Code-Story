<td>I see. So, Fuu...has met his end, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I was there... Why couldn't I save him?! Curse my powerlessness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You shouldn't blame yourself. Fuu knew the risks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What the—?! It's spouting water! There's enough to drown us all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Is it frantic to survive? Each time it loses one of its cores, it only grows more fearsome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I have made up my mind as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Voda! What are you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I, protector of the seas and one with water, bestow upon thee...my domain of the free-flowing torrents. Haaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Voda, what did you—? I can move! What's happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Lisbeth...our powers are similar. They can be employed to this effect if we so will it. Do not forget this.</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Such a method will not reach the heights of purification, but it can enable you to heal people holistically, rather than merely healing their physical wounds. That is the true power of water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You can do this, too, if you train yourself more in wielding your power. Once this is over, I will oversee your training personally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes, I'm looking forward to it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Let's see... Two more cores left... The water core is in its neck, I believe. Lisbeth, won't you lend me a hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I will create a stream of water leading to the dragon's neck. Could you freeze it into a solid path for us to walk upon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Okay, I'll give it a try!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>O water... Flowing ever freely, yet denying all. O master of the icy depths... Open a path, I command thee! Yaaaaaaaaaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Freeze Over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It worked! We've made a path! Now we just need to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>They couldn't have appeared at a worse possible time! We cannot stay here fighting all them off... The shortest path to the dragon would be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Glurrrrrrrrrrrp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Kiki! Adel! We're saved!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I have an idea. We'll ask them for assistance! We're so close... You'll not get in our way, Dragon!</td>
