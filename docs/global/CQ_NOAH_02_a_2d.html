<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(I bet she's sleeping in again. She definitely overdid it at her job last night, even though I explicitly told her not to!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(I should have gone to wake her up.)</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Now then! Noah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Y-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Before we begin, I'd like you to be an example for the class. You have a firm grasp of the basic principles, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You don't mind, do you, Noah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>O-oh! Of course not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(If you practice magic in accordance with the proper theories and follow the correct procedures, you will definitely get results.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>All right. You can do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(Ah, it feels so good to see my hard work pay off!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Splendid! I can always count on you, Noah. All right, class, let us begin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If you do well, then next time we shall practice on real monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes, professor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Okay, here I go... Kazam! Huh? Why didn't it work?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I can't do it! It's too difficult! Does it only work for honor students or something?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Honor students only, huh?  Well, Noah is so inflexible, and if everything isn't by the book, she just snaps!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Totally! She won't let you so much as put a book in the wrong place without nagging your ears off! She may be an honor student, but that doesn't make her a nice person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(If everyone just puts their books wherever they want, then the shelves will get all messed up. They have numbers on them! Why can't they just put them back properly?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(What does it matter that I'm an honor student? People who can't follow simple rules have no right to talk!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(There's nothing wrong with my behavior! What I'm doing is right!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Morning, Noah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What's got you all angry this early in the morning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>E-Emma! Wait, did you take my glasses?! I can't see without them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yup, I did! 'Cause, you know... Gotta turn that frown upside down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wh-what? Why? This is so embarrassing! Emma, come on, I really can't see! Give them back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Uh-oh... Here! Quick, take them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh my gosh! The monster cage is open!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Urgaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ugh! What is going on?!</td>
