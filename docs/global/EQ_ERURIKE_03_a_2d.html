<td>I-I thought my heart was gonna stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's still too early to heave a sigh of relief. Before the other guards see us, let's do what we came here to do and then get out of here...huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Is there a voice coming from this back room?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Quiet... It looks like we can peek in from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Heheh. We earned well today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yeah. My blood ran cold when the Sand Hawks showed up, but that sandstorm saved us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That being said, we've got quite a lot of product now. If we don't get rid of some of it soon, some of it might go bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, with the Guild Guard snooping around, we can't make a single false move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Tsk. It's a hassle to take care of them. Here's your food!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's the kid from earlier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Calm down, Elrike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But...! I can't believe they'd lock children up in a cage like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It seems like the rumors were true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The rumors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes. There has been talk that the bandits who have been rampant around these parts lately have been using humans as products.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>From what I can see there's a lot of children, but some young women as well. I guess this is where all the missing travelers ended up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What are they going to use all of these people for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm sure some of them will be sold as slaves and workers, but I can think of another more sinister use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Philosopher's Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>They may be using the forbidden arts to directly remove the Alchemia Particles from their bodies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh...! That's horrible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes. Truly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Both we and the Guild had begun secretly investigating this matter, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I never expected us to find direct evidence right here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The Guild and the Sand Hawks, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I had no idea it had gotten to the point that you needed to combine forces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, it was purposely kept quiet. That being said, amongst the merchants with keen eyes, I'm sure there were those who noticed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Is there any way we can save that child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Not right now, at any rate. It'll be difficult for just the two of us to free all those people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If we cause ruckus now and they go deeper into hiding, we'd have to start our investigation all over again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I can't believe we're just going to leave them like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's just a matter of time. Their reign of terror won't last much longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You brat! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hey, don't hurt the merchandise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Shut up! How dare you spit in my face! I'll kill you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No! As a merchant, I can't stand by and watch you trade humans as if they were goods!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huh? Um?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I-I...um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>An intruder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Elrike, we're gonna open all these cages! Try to free as many as you can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I...couldn't stop myself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Never mind that! Come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ye-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It was definitely a foolish move. We should've laid low.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That being said, you stayed faithful to your beliefs as a merchant. That's not something anyone can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I wouldn't be able to call myself a Sand Hawk if I abandoned you over this. So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>From now on, I want you to follow your judgment as we advance forward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hey! What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It's Balt the Storm! He's infiltrated our hideout!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Calm down. We outnumber him. If we corner him, he won't be able to escapeâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Bo-boss! It's the Guild Guard! The Sand Hawks are with them too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>They're infiltrating the hideout!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh? Wh-what the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It seems like reinforcements have arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Agh. Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Elrike! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Huh, Elaine?! Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I was hired by the Guild! Seriously. You're always putting yourself in harm's way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Deputy Commander Balt! We've finally caught up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Yeah. I'll compliment you on your timing. How many of the men have you brought?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Half! The rest are with the Commander. They've gone to protect the caravan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Very well. That should be enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That being said, the Guild must be desperate if they're now recruiting mercenaries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>But how did they know we were here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I'll explain later. Right now we need to free all the children here. Come on, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
