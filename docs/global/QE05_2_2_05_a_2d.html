<td>This cannot go on for much longer. It has truly been a blessing to have had the chance to stand with one such as you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>However, the time for that has come to an end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Rise, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Lord Waginau...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Listen, Kamui. From this moment on, you shall become this world's only Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Lord Waginau, what do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Perhaps you will understand once I do this. Burning Seal!</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wh-what?! What is this power?!</td>

<td>As I am now, weakened and drawing upon my last dregs of strength, there is nothing I can do to close that Door. Except for this.</td>

<td>Using it allows me to sacrifice my own life energy in order to gain a power beyond comprehension.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Your own life energy?! Lord Waginau, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Come, Kamui. I shall shield you from the worst of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Th-this is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes. This is what lies beyond the Door of Truth that was contained within the heart of Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You should know this better than any other. Although it may be your first time laying eyes upon it, you must have felt it here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>And...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The light is taking on human shape?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ah, yes. Those are the echoes of the knights who once died protecting our world from the heavenly beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>They are little more than wisps now. All of the pride and dignity that once made them what they were is gone now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Kamui, I will now begin the ceremony to seal the Door. Try to buy me some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
