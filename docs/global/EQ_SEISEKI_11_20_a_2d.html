<td>002</td>
<td>Arghhhhhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa... Heh. The Greed Dike soldiers are nothing without the Templars!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wipe the blood off your nose first, little frog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Sh-shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Revenge Crush!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We may have reinforcements, but there are still many Greed Dike soldiers left. Keep your guards up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>R-right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa... There sure are a lot of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes. It's a nuisance—but even with their numbers, we can take them out if we do it one by one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's just... The Greed Dike soldiers are...distracted by something. They've all started shouting at each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Don't tell me that those guys are just now feeling the sting of my attacks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wipe your nose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh, uh, thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Everyone! I have a report!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>A report...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It says that Lord Commander Kanon defeated Orion. It looks like the Greed Dike soldiers got the same report!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wh-whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>L-Lord Commander Kanon? She did it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ngh... Ughh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hey, are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Y-yes... What's all this commotion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>They're saying that your Lord Commander defeated Orion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>K-Kanon?! Nngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>H-hey! Don't push yourself too hard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Kanon... Is she...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Well...that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What? Spit it out already! If it was as simple as Kanon winning the battle, those guys would be a lot quieter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's just... The report says that she's now in battle with Captain Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Kudan and...Kanon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Why would they be fighting?! Can we trust this information?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>H-hey, don't kill the messenger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I can't believe that man. He told me to protect you, and then he just up and left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What?! Kudan said that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Captain Kudan has chosen a solitary path. It seems that he didn't want us to get involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You mean...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>He's planning to sacrifice himself to shield us from the calamities that will befall this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>He set out on a lonely path to obtain the power he needs in order to protect this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You're like his little sister. That's why he said goodbye to you first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Kudan...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Will you go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>He acts tough, but I'm sure that guy is thinking of you, even now. You're important to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You should be there to witness the end of this lonely battle he chose for himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Don't get complacent! The Greed Dike soldiers will never be defeated! Come and get it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I can't leave with the battle still going on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ngh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Wh-what is this light?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The Tower of Babel is...fading?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>No! Emperor Orion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>He couldn't really have been defeated...could he?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It seems that the threat of Nimul's resurrection has passed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>D-don't worry. The battle is...almost...over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>C-Captain Yauras?! Seida?! Captain Othima?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Their bodies are fading?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Unfortunately... Th-this is...the end for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>We were summoned here by Emmel's soul. Nimul's resurrection has been stopped, and so...our mission...is complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It's all right. You've got some fine...warriors assembled...here. You'll...be...fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What? H-hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It looks like it's up to those of us left behind to finish this. Leave it to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Thank you. All of you. Rest in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'm...not sure I like the way you put that. Kagura...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Bud was right. Y-you have...a duty to watch Kanon...and Kudan's...battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Let our will survive! You must make sure that...the next generation...knows how...the justice of this world...was upheld!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Please don't go yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>The future of...humankind...is in your hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It is your duty to...create a beautiful world where everyone has...the right to live!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Make sure our...justice...r-reaches...the next generation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Th-they're...gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Thank you...everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>We must remember them as they were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Indeed. So... What are you going to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I'm going to go, of course. I owe them at least that much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Captain Kagura...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Chloe, you're free to go, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You're worried about your friend, right? Go on. Go to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Th-thank you, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Hey. You should go, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>B-but I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>You're worried about Kanon, aren't you? If you can't concentrate on the battle, you'll just hold us back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Th-thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Here I go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Kudan...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>This is the last stand. Ready, Kanon? Let's settle this once and for all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Don't worry. With Orion gone, the Greed Dike soldiers should pipe down. You should focus on sorting out our dispute first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Captain Kudan... Is there really no way to change your mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Heh... I'm not sure that I believe in destiny, but I dare say it looks like fate has brought us to do battle here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Unfortunately, two kinds of justice cannot coexist in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>So you've made up your mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I have. Let the outcome of this battle decide whose justice this world desires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Phew... I feel...kinda strange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I know it's silly at a time like this...but I'm reminded of when I first joined the Holy Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>If not for all that has happened... If not for where we are... It almost feels like I'm learning swordsmanship from you all over again, Captain Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>What is this ridiculous sentimentality? We may have fought together once, but we were walking down completely different paths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Paths that have led us to this impasse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Protecting this world is the duty of all of mankind, Captain Kudan. It's not right for you to be the only one to sacrifice yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I'm doing this to save you, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>You're wrong. Protecting the balance of the world is not so simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>You should continue to be a symbol for the people. If there is to be a sacrifice, let it be me alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I guess we'll never see eye to eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Indeed. As knights, there is only one way to settle this. Let our blades decide this final battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I'm ready, Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Kanon, here I come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Take this!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Too soft!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>What are you doing? You should know that weak attacks like that won't cut it against me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I...remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>When you were teaching me swordsmanship... You always said that I lacked the thirst for blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>You certainly haven't changed. Your blade is still too indecisive. You can't expect to finish off your enemy like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>That's probably true, but this is how I... How the Lord Commander fights. This is the sword that the world wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Heh... That's the spirit. Now, come at me with all you've got!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>So, it seems that you can match my speed now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Huzzzaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Tch! It's impressive that you can keep attacking using that stance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Argh! You... You got me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Yup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Ngh! It seems you've improved since we last crossed swords on Ramproad Mountain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I wonder if this is what Lord Zain and Captain Cadanova were like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>I heard that when they were young, they sparred with each other on Ramproad Mountain, over and over, for training. It sounds just like us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>It does. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Yeah... Unlike them, we've chosen different paths that lead away from each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Paths that have reached a point of no return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Kanon, I'm done reminiscing. I'm not going to hold back anymore! Come at me with everything you have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Huzzzaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Kanon! Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Wh-what is this?! Is this really a fight between two humans?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>It's more like a battle between a god and a demon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Is that...Orion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>S-so they really did it... They put a stop to Orion's ambitions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Ngh! These shockwaves are powerful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Why in the name of the gods are they fighting?! There's absolutely no reason for the two of them to go at it! Stop it already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Y-yes, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>They're too evenly matched! How far are those two going to take this?!</td>
</tr>
