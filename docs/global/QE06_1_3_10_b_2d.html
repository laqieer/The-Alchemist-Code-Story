<td>Heh! You startled me for a moment, but a feeble strike like that cannot decapitate me.</td>

<td>We've eradicated them all, sir. The others should be catching up to me shortly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Okay then! Now that we've defeated the big boss of demons, it should get a whole lot easier to fight demons in this region!</td>

<td>Unfortunately for you, we have plenty of spares to go around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>H-how could you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Heh. Yes! Despair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You, let go of Amane. Now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Do you think you can do anything against me on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hey... Will you leave this place if I go with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>With you as a prize, I would call it a good day. Sure. I'll leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Amane... What are you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Don't worry, Celis. I will not die just yet. I will come back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>More importantly, please take care of Azami.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
