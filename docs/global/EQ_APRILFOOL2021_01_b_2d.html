<td>It certainly wasn't pretty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Indeed not. You even shouted, "Arghhh!!!" when charging into battle, with three h's and three exclamation points. Truly shameful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>How is that shameful?! That is entirely consistent with this game's style guide, I'll have you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It was a frenzied battle cry, three times as exclamatory as an ordinary effort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Quite right. Producing such an exclamatory effort when engaged in battle should be a clear signifier that the coming struggle will be epic and unforgettable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>In what rulebook does that appear?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Point is, you were rather disappointingly lackluster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, that's just the way it had to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh? And why's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes, why indeed? We are known as Wratharis' Deadly Trio, and considered to be a match for even the infamous father to those brats. Suffering a loss such as that is nothing short of shameful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But, what I'm trying to say isâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Even if it was a scripted battle you had to lose, you should at least have been able to take down one of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I think that would've gone over rather poorly in a tutorial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No excuses! The bottom line is, you lost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You're missing the point here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Am I? What point am I missing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That they're the main characters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
