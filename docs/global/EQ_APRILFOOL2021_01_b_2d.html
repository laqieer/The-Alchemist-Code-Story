<td>Indeed not. You even shouted, "Arghhh!!!" when charging into battle, with three h's and three exclamation points. Truly shameful!</td>

<td>It was a frenzied battle cry, three times as exclamatory as an ordinary effort.</td>

<td>Quite right. Producing such an exclamatory effort when engaged in battle should be a clear signifier that the coming struggle will be epic and unforgettable.</td>

<td>Yes, why indeed? We are known as Wratharis' Deadly Trio, and considered to be a match for even the infamous father to those brats. Suffering a loss such as that is nothing short of shameful.</td>
