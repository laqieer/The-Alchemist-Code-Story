<td>No...!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...Alia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I've told you everything. Are you satisfied now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's why I asked whether or not you were prepared to hear this. I didn't want to add to the burden you already shoulder...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Tamis...are you crying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No, it's just that...I'm happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I now know with what resolve the Wind Matter has been handed down to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'll do whatever I can to revive the power of the wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>For Saga...for Alia...for Fuu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And, of course, for you as well, Mocca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You mustn't worry yourself about anything further. This was all entrusted to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I am the one who must protect all of this. I swore to Alia that I would protect Saga. I must keep my promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's why I must be strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Not just me...but all of the Fuu faction must be strong for the sake of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's just the kind of conclusion I'd expect from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But, hold on...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Fuu, you were the one who, well...purged Alia, but you didn't destroy the Wind Shamans, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>In that case, why haven't there been any Wind Shamans besides Tina and Mocca until now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I don't know the reason why, but, ever since Alia was purged, the truth is that no new Wind Shamans were born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That being said, Fuu, why did you keep quiet all this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I was the one who was entrusted with this. This isn't your burden to carry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This is the result of my own actions. I should be the one to shoulder the responsibility for the promise I made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You really are a stubborn boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Still, shouldn't you have said something, Fuu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Far from it! As one of the Sprite Trio, I cannot afford to have any of you shoulder this responsibility!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Exactly. I lack strength...I'm well aware of that! Yet, still, I am asking this of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Didn't you ask Alia the same thing that night? Didn't you ask him why he hadn't told you sooner?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Right now, you are doing the same thing that Alia did. There really is no need for you to shoulder the responsibility and turn yourself into a villain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What would you know about anything?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>For the sake of the future...I'm imploring you not to repeat the mistakes of the past!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Heheh. Tina makes a convincing argument, Fuu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I will not repeat my past mistakes! How many times must I tell you to make you understand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Enough! How can you be so stubborn?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You...! Who do you think you're speaking to?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That has nothing to do with this! Having heard your side of the story, I want to help support your cause!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You've waited this long to tell me...and now I feel like an idiot for having questioned your motives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But you...right now, you're not listening to Alia's resolve...to our resolve...you haven't seen Tamis' tears!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>All you're doing is suffering on your own! That's why...we...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Mocca's right! This isn't something for you to shoulder alone, Fuu! This is something that concerns all of us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You're not the only one who wants to protect Saga! All of us here feel the same way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
