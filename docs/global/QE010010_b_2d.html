<td>Unbelievable! Their rebellion is giving birth to a great tragedy in the world. Are you going to turn a blind eye to that fact?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>How can you be so detached? Their lands were burned. They've lost their families. How are they different from us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What...?</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Zeke found us, and so we were able to grow up in such a loving environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Our encounter with him was nothing more than a coincidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>They...just weren't able to encounter such love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't put us in the same boat as them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But we are! If we hadn't met father, I'm sure we would be the same!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Don't be stupid! We're siblings. It was fate!</td>

<td>010</td>
<td>Thank you, Logi, but...I'm painfully aware of how horrible it feels not to have a place you can call home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You feel the same, don't you, Dias? Power doesn't solve anything. We need to look for other ways—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Shut up! This spiral of tragedy needs to be stopped! You two don't understand anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What're you ranting about? I heard you saved the village from monsters. It appears you've been running around doing as you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Father! My...apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>From here we enter the Woods of Mystical Nights. Our destination is the Gilrack Ruins beyond that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Most likely, we will find the rebel's hideout there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Logi, Dias, you join the scouting party. Agatha, you come with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
