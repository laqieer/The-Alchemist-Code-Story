<td>So this is the power of the Rainbow Cacao... I've heard the stories but this is a lot more than I expected it to be. You could be in big trouble if you don't use it properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yeah, it sure is dangerous. It's like the literal definition of "the look in their eyes changing." It's pretty rough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, yeah, aside from Brown Cacao, all other colors of Rainbow Cacao have been banned in the general market.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Putting aside the Purple Cacao's charm effect for now, the other cacao also have different effects that can affect both human and monster alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Even this cacao we're bringing along is strictly regulated by the country since it's used as materials for magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I see... That certainly seems like the safest option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I don't really like when they put restrictions on everything though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But it's the best option for maintaining order. The proper measures for potential issues are the only way to keep complete anarchy at bay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But, you know, Rainbow Cacao is still being sold in secret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I also heard that the price for it jumps around Valentine's Day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>According to my sources, Rainbow Cacao is called Dark Cacao!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Dark Cacao!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wow, that sounds awful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But how are they doing it? All magic materials sold in Lustburg are strictly regulated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There are always people who will find loopholes and exploit them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Then they need to tighten the reins. Maybe something like assigning each Rainbow Cacao a serial number and each country keeping a registry of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Actually, if each country were to regulate Valentine's Day and everything with it, it could deal a huge blow to any illegal cacao trade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I think that's going a bit too far. It's more of a morality problem we're facing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But something that shouldn't be available to the general public is being sold on the black market. Doesn't that indicate that the regulations are too lax?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>There's a limit to how much you can trust an individual's moral code. Sometimes you have to make difficult decisions to protect the peace, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Leafah has a point. Her logic is sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>W-wait, y-you're agreeing with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>However, I cannot agree to such draconian methods that would bring everyone down on Valentine's Day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I...rather enjoy Valentine's Day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>W-wait, really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...Let's take a break. I'll scout the perimeter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Suzuka's angry, isn't she.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Seems like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Sh-she is, isn't she! She's upset!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Arghhh! How did this happen?! I was trying so hard not to make things worse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It was probably when you suggested micromanaging Valentine's Day. Suzuka really loves Valentine's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I didn't realize... I had no idea that she loved it that much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>B-but it's just a day where you just give chocolates to people, right? What's so special about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>To Suzuka, Valentine's Day is more than just "a day where you give chocolates to people."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Well, last year was mine and Suzuka's first Valentine's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>And, well, we had a fight. Actually, it was more of a duel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>A duel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We both had things that we wouldn't back down on, so we fought. We both went all out because we refused to understand each other...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>She was such a pain in the butt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You don't seem that upset, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Speaking of which, we had our own fight on Valentine's, didn't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ah... We did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You two as well?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What is the meaning of this... I thought it was supposed to be a day you give chocolate to someone you have romantic feelings for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Well, that's not wrong either. But at the same time, it's not just that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>At least for Suzuka and I, we have the memory of our fight, our feelings and emotions laid bare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>And then of taking those feelings that are hard to put into words, melting them into chocolates, and enjoying them together. Sharing something beyond words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>At least that's what I think Valentine's is. Chocolates are just a pretext.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>A pretext? Nothing like that was ever written in any of the books I've read.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I see. So there are various ways to enjoy Valentine's Day. Kind of like different ways of thinking and values...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yet here I am, imposing my own morals and values on others... I do apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>No problem. Now, go make Suzuka understand that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Y-you're right! I have to go apologize... I'll be back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>S-Suzuka! A-about earlier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Knave!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
