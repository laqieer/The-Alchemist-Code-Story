<td>So this is the power of the Rainbow Cacao... I've heard the stories but this is a lot more than I expected it to be. You could be in big trouble if you don't use it properly.</td>

<td>Yeah, it sure is dangerous. It's like the literal definition of "the look in their eyes changing." It's pretty rough.</td>

<td>There are always people who will find loopholes and exploit them.</td>

<td>Then they need to tighten the reins. Maybe something like assigning each Rainbow Cacao a serial number and each country keeping a registry of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leafa.png" alt="Leafah" height="128"><br>Leafah</td>
<td>Actually, if each country were to regulate Valentine's Day and everything with it, it could deal a huge blow to any illegal cacao trade!</td>
</tr>

<td>I think that's going a bit too far. It's more of a morality problem we're facing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leafa.png" alt="Leafah" height="128"><br>Leafah</td>
<td>But something that shouldn't be available to the general public is being sold on the black market. Doesn't that indicate that the regulations are too lax?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leafa.png" alt="Leafah" height="128"><br>Leafah</td>
<td>There's a limit to how much you can trust an individual's moral code. Sometimes you have to make difficult decisions to protect the peace, you know?</td>

<td>W-wait, y-you're agreeing with me?</td>
</tr>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/itsu.png" alt="Itsuki" height="128"><br>Itsuki</td>

<td>And, well, we had a fight. Actually, it was more of a duel.</td>
</tr>

<td>A duel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/itsu.png" alt="Itsuki" height="128"><br>Itsuki</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/itsu.png" alt="Itsuki" height="128"><br>Itsuki</td>
<td>Well, that's not wrong either. But at the same time, it's not just that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/itsu.png" alt="Itsuki" height="128"><br>Itsuki</td>
<td>At least for Suzuka and I, we have the memory of our fight, our feelings and emotions laid bare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/itsu.png" alt="Itsuki" height="128"><br>Itsuki</td>
<td>And then of taking those feelings that are hard to put into words, melting them into chocolates, and enjoying them together. Sharing something beyond words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/itsu.png" alt="Itsuki" height="128"><br>Itsuki</td>
<td>At least that's what I think Valentine's is. Chocolates are just a pretext.</td>

<tr>

<td>A pretext? Nothing like that was ever written in any of the books I've read.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leafa.png" alt="Leafah" height="128"><br>Leafah</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yet here I am, imposing my own morals and values on others... I do apologize.</td>

<td>No problem. Now, go make Suzuka understand that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>...</td>

<tr>

<td>S-Suzuka! A-about earlier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
