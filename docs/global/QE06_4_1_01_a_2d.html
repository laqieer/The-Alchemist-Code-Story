<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>A way to restore Sumeragi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. The broken sword is currently kept in Castle Aquila Rubrum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But it is tightly secured with layers of protective wards. There wouldn't be such rigorous security unless it were feared someone may one day succeed in restoring it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Is there not some lore about Sumeragi that has been passed down amongst the Black Star clan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I think I may have heard something. But...could it really be true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So there is a way, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It seems hard to believe, but based on what we learned from Lady Celis and the legends passed down through the Black Star Clan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I believe another demon's horn may exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You must find it, Jubei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The issue is, I cannot say with any certainty that it will be able to restore Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I have some concerns regarding the horn, based upon the Black Star Clan legends and Mikaboshi's memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I believe it may be Tamba's horn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Even if we find it, we don't know what effect making use of its power might have on Tamba.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It may do nothing but strengthen our enemy. We must proceed with caution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If it truly is Tamba's horn, I would like to believe his deepest intentions have not faltered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>His intentions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The Tamba I saw within Mikaboshi's memories initially held a great hatred toward humans. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>By coming to understand Koga and Kaede's points of view, he overcame that hatred and desired instead to cooperate with the humans. It was only later that Malice once again warped his perspective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Tamba, at his truest, does not wish for humanity's destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>He simply wanted to protect that short-lived time of peace... That's what I believe, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We can't risk making things worse, however, out of little more than hope and belief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Which is why we must act now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Amane...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It won't be long before the Discarnate Power, Tamba, and Judius begin purging Wadatsumi of humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If we don't move quickly, we'll lose our only chance for a counteroffensive. So I'll go, and recover Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And I'll bring Logi Crowley back with me as well. That's why I need to rely on you, Jubei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We must restore Sumeragi and return peace to Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(It is just as Amane said. We must save Wadatsumi from the demons.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(It may be a foolish wager, but we must make it all the same.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So it really was true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It shouldn't be possible, but here it is. Another demon's horn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>To whomever this belonged, my apologies, but I'll be borrowing this horn. Please lend me your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Let us bring peace to Wadatsumi once more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Eek! Y-you're one of the Blade Fox Corps!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Welcome back. How did it go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I destroyed a village, just like you said to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You rather took your time, however, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Those who remain will be powerless. They will be exterminated sooner or later. Don't you think you should commit yourself to the desolation already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You dare to hesitate, still?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Of course not! I just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh?! What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(The Discarnate Power failed to sense anything? Then what could I be feeling?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(It's like a part of me has been awakened somewhere. This feeling, it's...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>If you're so concerned, why don't you go see what it was for yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Of course, if you're hesitant to confront whatever it might be, you could always just give me back my body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I do not hesitate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Then why am I able to talk to you right now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What is it you want? Do you want to exterminate them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Or do you want to protect them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Shut up! You don't understand anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I rather think I do. I've seen some of the memories you keep inside you. Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'm a demon too, remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Then you should understand that as a demon, I must do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Is that really how you feel? Or is that how someone else expects you to feel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You, of all people, should know the high price of leaving an opening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Shut up! Don't pretend like you know what you're talking about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>(Tamba's will has faltered. Is this my chance?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>(No, this is something different. I must wait for his will to be completely gone, leaving his body as nothing but a shell.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>(If that body is able to host Tamba's will, then it would surely be a suitable vessel for the Demon King as well.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>(I must not act impetuously.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What are you doing here? I was not informed you would be visiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I come with urgent business. I believe you'll want to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I find it difficult to believe that something so urgent could happen in Wadatsumi as it is now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>What if I told you the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi was taken from Greed Dike?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>The Sacred Three of Wadatsumi: the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi, the Treasure Blade Sumeragi, and of course, the sacred art of Kagutsuchi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Sumeragi is broken, and it's said the art of Kagutsuchi has been lost, so it's unlikely we'll need to worry about either of them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>But if Mikaboshi were to be returned to Wadatsumi soil, it would become another variable we'd be forced to deal with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It seemed best to inform you of this development.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>And just why would Mikaboshi be returned to Wadatsumi soil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Oh, I suspect you know. And I think you also know who might orchestrate such a maneuver.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Mm. Another variable to take into account, indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>One can never be too careful, no? No matter how insignificant the problem may seem. At any rate, that is all I came to report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>So, you expect us to deal with the situation while you watch on from the sidelines, is that it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I said nothing about dealing with this. I simply inferred that you should take note, and take heed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Semantic nonsense. It's the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Not at all! Allowing an unknown variable to exist makes our plan less likely to succeed. Therefore, it seemed only wise to keep you abreast of the situation, thus making the variable known.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I'll take care of it. It's no problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Ah, a sensible response. I'm glad someone here was able to provide one. All is for Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>You'd see us exterminated in one go if you could. But I assure you, things will not progress as you expect them to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>We will have the last laugh!</td>
</tr>
