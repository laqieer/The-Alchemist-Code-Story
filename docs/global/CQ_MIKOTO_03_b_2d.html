<td>...All right. That should do it. The barrier looks like it's all right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Good job, Mikoto! It looks like there wasn't any damage to the village. I'm glad everything turned out all right somehow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes. It's a relief. That being said, I wonder why the barrier was torn so easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The barrier is supposed to keep bad people from entering here, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes. Its immense power is completed by my presence in the shrine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So, when you said that bad things would happen if you left, you meant to the village, not to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes. My power protects this village and all of Wadatsumi. That is why I cannot afford to leave this shrine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ohh. The reason why the barrier was easily broken was due to the disturbance caused by my overt interest in the outside world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>My immaturity has placed my father, mother, and everyone else in danger... Tamamo, is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The fact that you have to stay here forever for the sake of everyone else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's too much for you, Mikoto!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh dear. I must return to my room soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...Mikoto! You're interested in the outside world, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...If it means the safety of everyone, then I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If you just leap across the barrier, you could see the outside world, you know? I'm sure no one would get mad...not even the Gods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There are a lot of fun things in the outside world. Don't you want to go to a festival with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's fine, Tamamo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Mikoto...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I would be lying if I said the outside world didn't interest me, but this shrine is where I belong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But don't you hate to be trapped in this place forever?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I may have been...trapped. However, from now on it is my will for me to remain here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Your will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes. For the sake of fulfilling my role as Shrine Maiden...no, for the sake of all those who rely on me, I wish to remain here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>When I was going around the grounds with you, Tamamo, there was something I noticed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>When I found out that this incident had occurred and had caused damage...it made me very sad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It made me realize that, even though I don't meet my parents very often, they worry about me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If something were to happen to me, they would be devastated. And I, too, if something were to happen to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You said that you didn't want anyone to suffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yeah. Just the thought of suffering makes my chest hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm the same. It would make me very sad for my parents, the villagers, or anyone in Wadatsumi to suffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But, but...there are a lot of people in Wadatsumi. And they place all of the burden on you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's because I have just that much strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Still, Mikoto...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The power I possess is immense and must never be abused. That is why I cannot leave this shrine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Today my reasons changed slightly. I won't leave this shrine because I want to protect those that are important to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...I see. All right, I understand, Mikoto.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Tamamo...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No. It's okay. It looks like it's goodbye then, Mikoto.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Right. You come from the outside world, Tamamo. There's no reason for you to stay here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yep! There are a lot of different places I need to visit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>U-um... This seems like an awfully cheerful goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Of course! After all, I'm gonna go visit a lot of different places, and then come back and tell you about it, Mikoto!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...! I get to talk with you again, Tamamo...? But now that the barrier has been fixed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Well, I'm not human. Besides, when I first came here, the barrier was perfectly in place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh, really?! If the Gods knew about it, they should've told me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Eheheh. That's why I'll be able to come and see you! I'm gonna travel all over the outside world in your stead, Mikoto.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...All right! I'll be looking forward to your return!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I wonder how Tamamo has been since then...</td>
</tr>
