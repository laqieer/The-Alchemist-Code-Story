<td>Ugh. I'm so hungry.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I never imagined that the city would be so large! Plus, it's all brick and cobblestone. I don't see a single animal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Grandma. I might not be able to keep my promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ohh...it's snowing.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>... ...</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, you moved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Um?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hey, what are doing there? Is this a new game? I'm pretty sure you'll freeze to death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, um, no. I'm, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Heheh. I-I guess you can say I sort of collapsed here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Collapsere? Is that some kind of new art? Are you a street performer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Umm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This child doesn't seem to understand the meaning of collapse! Is she some kind of rich girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I don't know how else to explain it. I'm so hungry, my mind is starting to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ahahah. I wonder if I'm hallucinating things. Something smells sweet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Are you talking about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's a chiffon cake from the sweets shop across the street.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Cake? Is that food?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Don't you know what cake is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huh? No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's no good. You're missing out on life. Try eating some.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Are you giving it to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Everyone should have the opportunity to enrich their lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Th-thank you? Wow. It's so fluffy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This is so delicious! I've never eaten anything like it before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The shop is right there. If you like it you could go buy some.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yea...yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Would you like to try this as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes, I would! Thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>This is also super sweet! What is this black food?! It tastes so good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>She doesn't know about chocolate. She ate it without knowing what it was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>A rare breed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh? Did you say something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This tastes as delicious as water lizards!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hm? What did you just say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh. Don't you know what water lizards are? Maybe you don't have them around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Of course, I do. It's a creature with four legs who lives in places with high humidity. What about water lizards?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I love the taste of water lizard! This is about as good as that—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>About as good as water lizard...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The cake that you're eating right now is my favorite. I lined up for an hour to buy it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>And you think it tastes about as good as water lizard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Fine. Come with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm going to teach you about the refined tastes of a lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wow! It's beautiful! Is all of this food?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Do you see anything you haven't eaten before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Huh? I've seen none of these before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>None...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What about this tart? And palmier? What about pudding? Wait, are you telling me you don't know what Sacher torte is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Um. The sweet things I've really eaten are sugar pickled fruits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I can't believe it! Then there's no point in living!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Is it that bad?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Here's a cream puff, ganache Sacher torte, and some Bavarian cream. I still have more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Are these all sweet? Can I eat them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Of course. Sweets are the coloring that decorates life. At least that's the case for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Wow. This is incredible! They're all sweet, but each one tastes different. Some are soft, and some are chewy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You should give you impressions one at a time. Also, you don't have to eat in such a hurry. The sweets aren't going anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It's just so delicious. Hey, what're you drinking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Would you like to drink it as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yes, please! Why is it so bitter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It's supposed to be. When you drink this, it brings out the sweetness of the sweets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>In other words, it's a sophisticated flavor. You have to be mature enough to understand it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>That's what my grandma used to say. It tastes like medicine, so I don't like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Oh! Maybe this girl is that type my grandma used to tell me about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>A modern, feminine, and urban gentlewoman! I mean, she was kind enough to feed a complete stranger. I'm sure of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>U-um! I'm Milis from the plains of Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What's the matter? You've gone all formal on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Please make me your protege!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I-is that a no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Do you know who I am? I'm sorry, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I want to be a dignified gentlewoman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What did you just say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>My grandma used to tell me that, since I was born as a girl, I should aim to become a lovely gentlewoman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I didn't know what that meant until now, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I'm sure she meant someone like you! That's why I want to become your protege and learn as much as I can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Hey, Milis...are you always like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Well, I'm always me. The lady living next door used to compliment me for always being energetic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Yes, you are energetic. And strange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Oh, that's right! I need to repay you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Repay me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You gave me all this food. Of course, I should repay you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>It was my choice to give it to you. Don't worry about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>By the way, what's your name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>She's not even listening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>It's Lofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>All right, Lofy! Let's go! We need to find a shop that offers my favorite food!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Oh, wait a moment—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I'm going to do everything I can to make sure you eat some delicious water lizard cuisine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>You're so...forceful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Waaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I-I can't believe there isn't a single shop that has water lizard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You'll be hard-pressed to find a shop that serves such bizarre food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>It looks like I'll have to catch one myself! Just you watch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Look. I don't need any repayment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Hold on, Lofy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Sigh. You're hopeless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Hey, I found one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>It doesn't seem to have noticed us yet. Should we use magic to take it down from here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Ahaha. Then we won't be able to eat it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Let's go around a little more. I probably won't notice us approaching from the shadow of that rock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>How do you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>I find the best place to hunt by listening to the breathing of the trees in the forest. That's my way of hunting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Hold on. Are you able to read the flow of Alchemy in this forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Now!</td>
