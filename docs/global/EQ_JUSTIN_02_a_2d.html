<td>001</td>
<td>Argh! You'll pay for this, Detective!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I wonder what he was even upset with in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Um, thank you for your help. Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ah, my apologies. I'm Justin, one of the nation's Peacekeepers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Right now, I just happen to be chasing down a criminal called Chat Noir. Have you seen any suspicious...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...? Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>N-no! That being said, my dear lady! Perhaps it would be best if you covered yourself a little more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Do you think so? Does my outfit look bad on me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I-it's not a matter of that! It's that...I have a hard time knowing where to look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, why is that? Would you please teach me what you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>St-stop! I told you to stop! I can also have you brought in for public altercation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You're quite the exagger—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ehem! In any case, what is a lady like you doing alone in a back alley like this? You seem to be a foreigner. Is there anyone accompanying you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No. I'm traveling alone. Is that odd?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Dressed like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What does my outfit have to do with anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hmm... Anyway! This isn't a good neighborhood so let me take you to the main boulevard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Are you going to walk with me? If so, I have a request I'd like to ask you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Do you know where this city's toyshop is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>All right, I've closed everything up and finished delivery preparation on orders. I've got my tickets and everything is ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Finally got tickets to see the Envylia Orchestra. I'm really gonna enjoy it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Daisy, today I don't have time to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Um... Excuse me. Do you have a moment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If I recall correctly, you’re the Peacekeeper...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Justin. Ah, I wanted to ask if you're closed today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but we are. I've got plans for the full day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The time is a little inconvenient. There's something I wanted to ask you to repair today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...Who's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>She goes by the name Strie. Apparently, she's in the middle of her solo travels...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>An item of great nostalgia to me has broken and I came to this city wondering if I could have it fixed here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's unfortunate. However, today is an extremely important day in my life...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wait, is that toy in your hand the one you want me to repair?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, it is. Is it something very rare?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I've never seen anything like it before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>On top of that, it seems to be well used and has extensive traces of careful repair... It appears to have been greatly cherished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Is it the inside mechanism that's broken? This...ack...I'll need to take it apart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That being said, what's this engraving right here? Is it the maker's mark?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...! That engraving!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Have you seen it before, Detective?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>N-no, it's nothing. Recently, my investigation has been yielding little results and I've been somewhat on edge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ah, I heard that you let Chat Noir escape again. You don't know when to give up, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well, will you take it on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'll cancel my vacation. Having been shown something of this quality, it'll be a stain on my name as a toy maker if I were to send you away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Instead, are you willing to look after my shop while I'm taking on the repairs? This is gonna be quite the job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The owner of this toy shop has taken custody of Chat Noir's package.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It is the perfect opportunity to take it. Yet...that detective's presence is an interference.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>In that case, let's have our employee do a little work as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So why am I the one looking after the shop?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Well, you got yourself involved, so isn't it good manners to see it through until the end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well, that's true, but...I need to find the whereabouts of Chat Noir...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hey, how much is this toy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The price tag is right there. Do you have money on you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hey, this doll's hands came off! Can you please fix it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>All right, all right. All the toys you want repaired, you can place here along with your name and address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...? Is there something on my face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>No, I'm just surprised to see that you're good at looking after children, contrary to your outfit and mannerisms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Oh? Isn't it problematic if a detective were to judge people based on their appearances?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Well...you're right. I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Heheh. I was just teasing you. Don't worry about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>In my village, we all participate in taking care of the children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>That sounds like a nice village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Who knows? It's very small and closed off from the rest of the world. They're always averting their eyes from what's going on outside of their village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>That's why they've been left in the past and are no longer able to make strides forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...Hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hey, little boy over there! Show me what you just took right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>A-ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>So you stole something. Listen, kiddo. What you did just now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Here you go. I paid and bought it for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Huh...are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Yes. But just today, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Strie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>He wanted that toy and I wanted to buy it for him. See? There's no problem, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>But he won't learn his lesson then. Wouldn't you agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>If he did it with evil intent then he must be scolded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>However, scolding him alone might not help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>This shop is positioned right between the poor and rich districts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It's true. Left of here, the district spreads out into a place called Real Heavy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Redington City is a nice place...but there are those who suffer as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>There are those who cannot find work, who have their dreams stolen from them, and who have children who cannot buy toys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>For them, in order to become happy, they must exhaust all means. Is that such a bad thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Still, whatever the reasons may be, stealing is stealing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Furthermore, we are trying to do everything we can rectify the problems of this city!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>It's true that there are disparities that force even some of the residents of Real Heaven to have to leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Perhaps the result of that is Lost Blue..."the sunken city where light does not reach."<br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Lost Blue...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Oh, no, it's nothing! Please, forget what I just said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Well, fine. But doesn't your brand of justice eventually result in the severing of the weak?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Well, I'm doing my best to make sure that's not the case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Ch-Chat Noir has made an appearance?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>What?! Ack! There's no time to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Hey, wait?! Come on! We can leave the shop unmanned for a little while, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Is that one of the prototypes for the Guard Droid?! But the way it's moving...has someone made it go rogue?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Is Chat Noir behind this? I heard he was a thief, but I guess he's good with his hands as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>No, this isn't him. He'd never do something like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Heheh. From the way you just spoke now, there seems to be some kind of trust between the two of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>What?! Not at all! It's just...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>He has his own aesthetic when it comes to stealing...that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Heheh. I thought you just said, 'whatever the reason may be, stealing is stealing'?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Agh. That's true, but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Let's talk later! Right now, I need to handle this situation!</td>
