<td>They went back to their own time.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Then I guess I missed my chance to thank them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Who knows? You might have the opportunity again one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh yeah?</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If you live long enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>It'd be nice to run into them again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I think so, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Urgh... I used up too much power. I have to go home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Home...?</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're...traveling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yep. There was something I needed to learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Did you find out the answer to your first question?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It was worth the trip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Glad to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Albea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Maybe one day, huh?</td>

<td>Nobody likes being left behind, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Keep it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I have one, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Another joker?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>When we were playing Old Maid, I removed it from the deck and forgot to put it back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Baggage from a long journey...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Baggage...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It gets too heavy if you're always dragging it along with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Especially for people like you who just keep on adding to the load.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The only thing for it is to pick it up and carry it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Carry it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'll help you along. I'll take my share.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You have a home to get back to, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I don't have any memories worth dragging along with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>No problem. I'll share mine with you while we play cards. I've got a lot of stories about him, let me tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>About...Magnus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>About the things he did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You'll tell me all about what he liked and what he hated? All about his life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>All of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'll finally get to...see my brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>In a sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hah... Hahahah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What's up with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You'll help me sort out all of these messed up feelings?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Yeah... Something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>We...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Do you really think that we can carve out a proper life for ourselves now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Today, I saw the line that shouldn't be crossed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>And Magnus... He took away everything that would have been waiting for us on the other side of that line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Corpse's attention, the dark side of Alchemy, and the sin that comes with it... He took it all for himself in one sweep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Man, he really did it this time. He swept the whole dang table.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>He even made off with my fear of being taken out as I sleep at night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>He was a masterful gambler to the very end, your brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I wouldn't have had him any other way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Mister Will...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Just Will is fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Hmph. Why did you have to make such a fuss about it before, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Who else is gonna call me Will now that he's gone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>No more feigning ignorance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I won't leave you alone anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>What a pleasant surprise to meet you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Justice, justice, justice... That's all anyone ever talks about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>How boring. "The future of this world"? Who cares!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>How presumptuous of people to think that anything they do matters in the grand scheme of time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>In the future...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I found people who were living their present...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>People who fought for others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>No matter the era...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Even if malice should infest Alchemy, and the systems that govern it should rot...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I want to keep on living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>And that's why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I'm gonna keep on fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>For the future of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You have a brother who is aiming to become an excellent alchemist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I'm sure he will become a great Paladin and a wonderful alchemist. He will be a brother that will make you proud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>You must do your best to be a sister who can make him just as proud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>This coat...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>My mother made it for me when I was little, for me to grow into. It's based on my brother's uniform.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>When I grow up, I'm going to wear this for sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I'm going to fix all of my brother's machines, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Then I'm going to open up a shop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>From cups to clock tower bells; it'll be a mechanic's repair shop, where anything can be fixed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I'm back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>[Thank you so much for your continued patronage.]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>[I apologize for the inconvenience, and thank you for your patience.]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>[I am delighted to inform you that, as of today, I am once more open for business.]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>[Signed: Albeaâ€”proprietor of repair shop Magbea]</td>
