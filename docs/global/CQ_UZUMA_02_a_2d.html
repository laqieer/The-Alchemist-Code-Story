<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Phew... Thank you so much for all your help. It seems that I am not yet strong enough on my own...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hmhm. No need to thank me. Protecting you is simply one of the duties I am obligated to carry out in my position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Besides, I have personal reasons for wanting to help you. No one else can do what you can do. Your skills as a fortune-teller are indispensable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>In fact, that is what I would like to speak to you about. Would you mind terribly if we discussed this right away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I have some need of your gift. I hope the location is not a deterrent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>My...gift?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If you mean fortune-telling, then it’s no problem for me to do it here. You seem to be in something of a hurry, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I appreciate your cooperation. Hmhm. I was hoping that you would help me find somewhere in this desert with an abundance of Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>A place with an abundance of Alchemia? All right, let me see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What...? No... This can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Whatever is the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I've found a place with sparkling sands, but... Nefertiti, are you planning to go there if I tell you where it is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Are you suggesting that there is some kind of issue with me doing so? I see that you are reluctant to speak of it, but please do go on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lady Nefertiti, I see a dark shadow. The shadow of death draws closer and closer to you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I have never told a fortune that didn't come true. I really think that you should avoid this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh, my! Then it seems I must hurry. Thank you for the warning, dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Lady Nefertiti! Why are you so determined to go into danger alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It is the duty I was born to fulfill. I cannot allow anyone else to be dragged into it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Your duty? Oh... To protect the desert, you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I don't know if it will help, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>At the very least, as one who resides in the desert you protect, please allow me to try to do what I can to support you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Thank you, but I cannot allow that. Anyone who comes too close to me will only become victim to the same danger as I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>As a descendant of the Sephira, you are far too valuable to lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>On top of that, your fortune-telling skills have the potential to save many lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Truly? I... I really don’t think that something like fortune-telling could help anyone all that much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>After all, what's the point of fortune-telling when there's nothing that can be done to change what has been foretold?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I do not know if that is true. I am sure that there are many situations where what is coming cannot be changed, but it seems rash to say that fortune-telling has no use whatsoever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>To be able to see the future with some clarity allows for the opportunity to see what can be done in order to change it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You are the only one who can do what you do; giving people direction when they are lost, drawing forth strength from within them that they never knew they possessed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That is your power, and that is why I called upon you, rather than another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Lady Nefertiti...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(There's no way that's true. How can she sound so confident, even though what I have foretold will most certainly come to pass and bring unknown tragedy into her life?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(Lady Nefertiti is just one person, but now she faces danger alone for the sake of her duty.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(That complete lack of hesitation to do what she thinks is right... It's just like Miss Miuna. If I was more like that, I wonder if I could change something?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Thank you for saying all that, Lady Nefertiti. Shall we get moving? You'll be needing directions to reach that place where Alchemia can be found in abundance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Grr! Grrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Tsk, tsk. Looks like somebody didn't learn their lesson. Leave this to me, Uzuma. You should escape while you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(Lady Nefertiti is so capable! I don't want to get in her way... Maybe it's better if I just leave. Oh, no! Why is the shadow around her getting darker?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(I can't just leave her like this! If I stay, maybe I can get that shadow of death to move away from her, like I did for Miuna!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>There's no time to waste! There must be something I can do! I just have to believe in that!</td>
</tr>
