<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Lord Waginau? Those wounds! What happened to you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ceclidis had more tricks up his sleeve than I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Heh. How very unlike me to underestimate my opponent's strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>However, we have more important topics to discuss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It was always an expected eventuality that the ancient veil would be lifted and Sephiron would become known to the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Expected?! Do you mean to tell me you knew the village would be attacked?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I had no way of knowing when it would happen or who would do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>However, this was always a possible outcome as long as the Sephira and their Protector kept a stranglehold on the secrets of their taboos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Once knowledge of Sephiron and her secrets made its way out of the village, it was only a matter of time until somebody attempted to make use of her powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The previous Lord Commander foresaw this issue and prepared a contingency plan, the Desert Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The Desert Zone? The contingency plan is...the desert?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes. For generations, the Holy Guard has granted the desert people autonomy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That is how we have been able to maintain a region outside the influence of the seven nations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Only the Lord Commander knew that the purpose of doing so was for the protection of the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Now is the time to make use of his foresight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The Sephira, with their immense Alchemia, will be hunted down by those who plan to abuse the powers of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The Desert Zone was created to harbor the Sephira when the village and its secrets were brought to light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I've already ordered the rear guard to prepare to escort the Sephira there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The moment their retreat is complete, we will assault Ceclidis and his forces with all of our might!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No matter how large the army, it cannot function without its head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So we must first pinpoint Ceclidis' location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>From within that army? He's probably safely ensconced by his soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>According to our scouts, only his lieutenants were seen in their headquarters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Do you suppose he anticipates a direct attack on his position?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That, or he has other intentions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ceclidis is not one to risk danger for the sake of honor or glory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>For him to take it upon himself to lead an army to battle, there is likely some other ulterior motive at work here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If that is true, one thing does come to mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Lord Waginau...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>When I faced him in battle, he held a particular stone in his hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That makes it likely that Ceclidis' intention is to find Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Sephiron?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If my theory is correct, we do not have the luxury of time. We must make it to Sephiron before he does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>In that case, I will leave Ceclidis to you, Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I shall personally lead the Liberation Army into battle to distract the Royal Army's main forces and prevent any interference to your operation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I will go with you, Lord Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We will be deep behind enemy lines. I cannot guarantee your safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I understand. I am willing to take that risk, as we do not have any other choice, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I will come too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Isidore?! You are still battling the darkness. Who knows what will happen if you approach Sephiron?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I know, but as the commander of the warriors, I have a responsibility to fight for the good of this village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Isidore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>General Leordas, I leave command of my warriors to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Understood. I'll be waiting for the good news.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The plan is this: we shall identify and slip through a gap in the enemy's defenses, then make our way directly to Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Remember that we will be fighting behind enemy lines! If you fall behind, you will be left behind!</td>
