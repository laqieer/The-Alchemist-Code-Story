<td>Phew... We've destroyed their base. That should make it difficult for them to find any more victims.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>But there was no clear evidence that Gluttony Foss was involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>My best bet is that the buyer is near the border of Gluttony, likely even a Gluttony citizen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Someone focused on buying people with strong Alchemia... That's not much to work with, but it's a good lead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Thank you very much, Ryle. I'm sure we'll be able to move forward on this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's good to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If I hadn't met you today, this case would have been much more difficult, so...thank you very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Stop acting so sweet. It's creeping me out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>How rude. But I'm in a good mood, so I'll make a special exception for you today and give you a pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Thanks, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(We were able to resolve the situation by connecting people with different positions and goals...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I think I understand a little better now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Did you say something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...? All right, well, we're done here. The rest is your business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes, I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The conservatives are stubborn, but there are some who are more open-minded. I'm sure they'll do something about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Are you figuring out ways to get others to do your job right now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hehe. It was you who said that I would be good at that kind of thing, Ryle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ah... I shouldn't have said anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh, I wouldn't say that. In fact, I'm grateful. You've made me realize something important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The people of the desert are many and varied. Some want peace, some live in strife, some worry for the future, some want immediate power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We may all be looking in different directions, but we are all people of the desert. If we can just roll with their individual strengths and connect them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It has the potential to be a great force of good, even if it's not quite what Hawk dreamed of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If it works out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'll make it work. We can't afford to have another tragedy like Hawk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The role of the nobles is to do their best for the future and peace of the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That is my responsibility, not anyone else's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(I can't let his death be in vain.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That's why I hope you will continue to roll with the punches and do your best as well. In your own way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If possible, I'd like to be in a position where I can relax and let someone else do the rolling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes. I'll limit the work I ask you to do to the times when you'll be most effective, Mr. Ryle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I feel like you're ignoring the fact I'd prefer that you not need me at all... You really are one heck of a character.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hehe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I will use whatever I feel is necessary, no matter what you say. That is how I roll.</td>
