<td>Day of Strategy Implementation<br>Wadatsumi - Unspecified Port</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We arrived. It's the Wadatsumi port.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You're right. Finally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Kanon and the other's support troops are scheduled to land from separate locations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>A rendezvous point has been set up, so first let's head there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Um, I have a question... Why didn't we leave together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>First, it was to prevent our movements from being picked up by Orion from Greed Dike, who is eyeing the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Also, to avoid the eyes of a portion of the Holy Order who has an eerie attachment to Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The Holy Order...is completely a part of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This may be unwarranted, but...just in case. They're in a much better situation to get information than Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>In fact, right before departure, they congratulated me. Depending on the way you look at it, they could be scrounging for information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Anyway, it's best to get close to them before they find out about the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's why we made them move separately from us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>In order to make it look we're going to multiple locations, we had the gathered Paladins separate into a few groups and head in different directions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>They're all going their individual routes but will meet up in the same spot. From there, the plan begins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I see...So you're being extra careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It can't be helped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's always best to avoid things that may turn into problems down the road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Understood. Then all that's left is for us to head to that rendezvous point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Even as we speak, look what's decided to show up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This area used to be inhabited. Wild monsters, huh? Let's quickly take them out!</td>
