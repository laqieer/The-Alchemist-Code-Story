<td>GRAAAAAAAUH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We did it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So, the weeds really were the source of its strength. We couldn't have defeated it without your magic, Lisbeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hardly! I'd still be stuck dealing with all those weeds if it weren't for you, and the illusion would never have been broken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's all thanks to you, Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm always...being rescued by you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's not true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I've always trusted my own strength and refused the help of others...but working together to accomplish something...isn't half bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Lisbeth, you made me realize that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Really...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>C'mon, we're almost there, right? Once the ice melts, that thing might come back. We had better hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I feel like I'm forgetting something...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Um..."Look into the ice. The reflection shows those beyond flesh and blood who think of you."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>"If you love the ones reflected in return, you will find a token of your love ahead. If not, you cannot proceed."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What's wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(I completely forgot! There's a signpost where the ice mirror is!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(He's going to know what the mirror does! If... If he sees himself in the mirror when I look into it...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Uh... Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(He's going to think I'm a weirdo! I can't let him see how I feel like this!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I-I'm heading back to the dorm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Are you sure? We've already made it this far. I thought you said you wanted the flower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I-I do! B-but...there's something life-or-death that I forgot to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I have to go back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Mm... Well, if you say so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes! It's fine now! I'm overjoyed that we got to spend some time together searching for the flower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's...good to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(I don't need to look in the mirror, or have a Stub Rules flower to know that these feelings...are real.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(When I see him smile, I remember how I felt the first time I met him. I feel exactly the same now as I did then.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(Just thinking about it makes me feel warm inside.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(I want to convey all of my feelings. I've got to tell him right away!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I enjoyed our little adventure, too. You have my gratitude, Lisbeth. You've given me something good to remember on my last day here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(Yuffie...it was just like spending time with you. I was able to feel the same kindness—even for just a moment—that I often felt back then.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(However...it's over now. I can never go back.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Um, Dias?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Lisbeth, I'll walk you back to the dorm. Don't let your guard down until we're out of the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>See ya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Dias, wait up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I need to talk to you! It's about the Sacred Stones!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I'm sure you'll find what I know useful. So, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Would you meet me at the Venus School of Magic? In the courtyard where we first met?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Combo Skill Quest: "So We Can Call Upon Eternity, Someday" unlocked!</td>
