<td>Reagan, are you here? I need your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Incredible... I've never seen dissatisfaction levels on this wavelength before, let alone this high!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, shut up about your wavelengths. I need you to look at that gun you souped up for me. I think it's broken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My weapons don't just 'break'. What in Babel have you been doing with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What they usually pay us markswomen for. You know, scouting from up high, protecting VIPs...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What? Got something to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Do you realize how delicate an instrument a long-range firearm is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If you're going to keep using yours as a cudgel, you can find someone else to work on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Was it really that obvious? I mean, I didn't have a choice! You should be thankful I made it back alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, I guess it's not your fault. Honestly, if only those mercs didn't have such big mouths!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is all because they mentioned my dad...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ah, yes, you did mention you were searching for your father. A famous mercenary, as I recall?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's right. I mean, he was actually just a sportsman, but he was still pretty famous in those circles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Anyway, I overheard a group of mercs talking about someone who sounded just like him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Only, they were saying he'd been seen visiting bandit hideouts and advising gang bosses... All sorts of bad rumors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Isn't that good news? Now you might finally be able to track him down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I guess so, but I never thought he'd be working with criminals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is it really surprising that unsavory types would take an interest in him if he's famous in the mercenary world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>They sometimes did in the past, but he always turned them down. I can't believe he'd change his mind now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hmm... So with that on your mind, you've been having trouble focusing on your work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm confused. If you truly have faith in your father, your concerns are illogical.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Unless you're worried that maybe you don't believe in him as firmly as you thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Of course I believe in him! I just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Maybe you're right. I've never really thought about why he left. I guess I was too scared to try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Perhaps we'd both be better off not seeing each other again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You'll never know unless you confront him. If you can't face that, you should stop wasting valuable mental energy dwelling on him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Otherwise you'll keep using your poor gun for things it wasn't meant for, and that wouldn't be fair to it. Speaking of which...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Whoa, you fixed that quick! Hold on, where are you off to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I've sent some prototypes to a certain village for field-testing. I want to see how they're doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Development and innovation requires action. If you'd rather waste your time here dwelling on useless things, you're free to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You know, you're being pretty insensitive to a girl in a crisis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm just telling you the situation as I see it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You're really trying to get under my skin, aren't you? Fine, I get it, I'll go with you!</td>
