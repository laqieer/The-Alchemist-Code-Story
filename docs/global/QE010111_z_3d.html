<td>Once we pass the grasslands, there's a village...and beyond that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...Are the gates of Castle Valderik! The promised land where Wratharis and Envylia may be united in peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Indeed. If things go well, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Lord Gabirond!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I am relieved to see that you are safe, Lady Agatha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Or...perhaps I should call you the representative of peace from Dominion of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Y-you...flatter me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmph... And what is the grand councilor of Envylia doing in these war-torn parts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sabareta! Don't be rude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Do not worry. Pompous formalities will get in the way of honest communication.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Tr-true... Are you not the one leading the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Please, have them stop their attacks on the Lizard Brigade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm sure you've been made aware of this, but we are currently seeking a peace treaty between the Kingdom of Envylia and Old Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>At least stand down until we arrive for peace talks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You appear to have misunderstood something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We are simply here to confirm what your true motives are. We have no intention of attacking, whatsoever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You wish to propose a peace treaty to King Patrick in order to establish unity between our two kingdoms, am I correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What? Oh, yes! Our aim is to hold an audience with the King! We want him to hear our proposal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hmm. You truly are Captain Zeke's daughter. Quite impressive for one so young.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Very well. I will convey your intentions to the King. Be careful on the road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Y-yes! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Watch out for that man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...Huh? What are you saying? Even now, he is concerned for our safety?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Honestly, you truly are naive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>There's something suspicious about himâ€”something completely separate from both Wratharis and Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I understand why you might be deeply skeptical, but you can't just suspect everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Still, it's best to avoid all dangers. In order for me to fulfill my promise to Zeke, I want you to remember to pay close attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes, I know. All right, let's go!</td>
