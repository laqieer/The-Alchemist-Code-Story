<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Your mother ruled the fallen Wadatsumi? Doesn't that make you royalty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I guess so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Y-you gotta be kidding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I wish with all my heart that I was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ever since then, Wadatsumi has been under the reign of Greed Dike as part of their country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But what about this Chihaya person? Wasn't she a shrine maiden of Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes. Apparently, she remained in Wadatsumi after its collapse and attempted to reconstruct the desolate, war-torn country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It seems her prayers and dances have a mysterious power that gives courage and hope to all who see her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Thanks to her, the country's restoration has been proceeding unexpectedly fast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I see. Chihaya really seems to have made a difference.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You might be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But how do you think it would appear to Greed Dike who now occupies Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh? Ah... They may see it as the start of a rebellion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Right? I mean, even someone like you can anticipate that. She's really naive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You said something similar earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>My entire family, as well as the people of Wadatsumi, were killed right before my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's...horrible. To be destroyed by such a one-sided attack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Greed Dike invaded us simply to expand their territory. Also, they wanted the rights to Wadatsumi's unique trade goods and works of art.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Are you serious? If they attacked for a reason like that, there's no way the Holy Guard would have remained silent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes, normally they wouldn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>However, ultimately Greed Dike's acts of aggression were accepted and justified throughout the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This was because it was discovered that we had been using Alchemy in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Alchemy?! Why? Did you not know about the Magna Code?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wadatsumi engaged in little trade with the other countries; thus we had our unique culture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Within our culture, we referred to what is known as Alchemia as Chakra and phantoms as samurais.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>In other words, since using Alchemy had always been the norm from ancient times, we had little idea that it was forbidden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't tell me that Greed Dike knew about this and took advantage of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Who knows? One thing I can say for certain is that their invasion was incredibly swift, calculative, and merciless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I tried desperately to resist, but I didn't have enough power. All I could do was helplessly watch as the flames consumed everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If Kudan hadn't saved me, I wouldn't be here today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Captain Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's why I decided I would become strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...I would learn the skills necessary to survive and to protect those who I came in contact with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What Chihaya did was by no means a bad thing. But...I do think it's problematic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>By her acting independently in Greed Dike occupied Wadatsumi, it gives them an excuse to once again go on a rampage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>So are you surprised? I have a pretty messed up past, don't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Sniff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Kagura, I'm sorry about the cruel things I said to you without even knowing about your past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hey! What are you crying about?! I didn't tell you because I wanted your sympathy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Bu-but...sniff...sob...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Come on. You're too easily manipulated by your emotions. I told you it wasn't good, airhead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You called me airhead again! Sniff...so mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Enough talk. Both of you, get ready for combat.</td>
</tr>
