<td>Don...I'd like to keep casualties as low as possible until we reach the Beckrams' mansion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It might take longer, but I think we should take roads that are less likely to have Guard Droids in wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Fine. I'll leave it to you. More importantly, what are you planning on doing with them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>With who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ronnie and the little lady. We're heading to the Beckrams' home base. I think this is where you should draw the line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yeah...I see what you mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You gotta be kidding me, Don!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You said that an act of clumsy kindness would only serve to stain the recipient's resolve. Have you forgotten your own words?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ah...! Well, I meant it when I said it, but, in this case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Didn't you say that everyone must pave their own path?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is my choice. You won't deny it, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No, but...their home base is infested with Guard Droids...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I still haven't discovered the truth behind my father's death!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I don't think I will ever find out until we obtain the Sacred Stone Belphegor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Please...take me with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I thought both of you had the policy of never turning down the request of a lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You do realize that we're both women, don't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Please!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>There's nothing more frightening than women in this world. You're right about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Utterly. I wash my hands of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Tsk! Let's go!</td>
