<td>Arrrgghhh! Urrrggghh! It burns! It burns!</td>

<td>It took some time, but I managed to find out that the origin of that technique lies in Spiritbonding...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Which means that I now know how to counter it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Haaa... Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(That attack from before got me worse than I thought. At this rate, I won't be able to—!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huzzzaaahhh!</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>L-Logi...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Sorry I'm late. We'll deal with things here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Its weak point is that mark part, right? Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You! You dare interfere with my plans again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Grant me strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That attack just now... I see. So you finally understand.</td>

<td>We, the founders of Alchemy, draw and wield our power from the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The first step is the art of making oneself that very key to the truth, and this is what gives us our startling powers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's not important right now—you're injured. Hold on, okay? I'll patch you up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Right... Thanks.</td>

<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Looks like that's the last of them. Gotta say, I didn't think they'd show up here of all places.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It just shows how scared they are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The power of our Alchemy has them shaking in their boots!</td>

<td>Kamui, you need to take it easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I can't. That girl, Agatha... We need to get her...to safety.</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Kamui?! Hey! Kamui! Wake up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's been a while since I've worn this armor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It might feel like a bit of an exaggeration right now, but this armor is the symbol of our justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So all that effort we spent keeping them polished and oiled meant something after all, huh? I'll keep that in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>As you should! May the Blue Flames blaze again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh, my! Don't you all look gallant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You think so, Lady Marie? Heh. Guess I'm not too bad, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Don't get excited, you dunce. Sorry for asking you to do menial things, Lady Marie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Not at all! I want to do whatever I can to help, too! Please let me know if you need anything, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>She's a nice girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>She is. I want to make this world a place in which people like her can live out their lives without shedding a single tear of grief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well said—nngghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oi! Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I see that you have kept up your training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>However, it is of little consequence. That armor of yours is truly meaningless, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>N-no way! It can't be! Y-you're...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Exactly what is so surprising? You should have known that there is nowhere for you to run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Now, answer me! Where is Logi?</td>
