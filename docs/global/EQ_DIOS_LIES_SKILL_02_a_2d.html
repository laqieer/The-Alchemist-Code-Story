<td>This forest is swarming with monsters and vermin. I'm surprised you made it so far on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I've been here before, so I thought I'd be able to handle them all on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, I guess they don't stand much of a chance when you use your alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But it must take a lot out of you to cast one of your spells. It's not like you can keep casting them one after another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Lisbeth, don't just stand there daydreaming. Something could take you by surprise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>R-right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Which way are we heading? You've been here before, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Don't tell me you don't remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>N-no, I do! It's this way! I think...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You think...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I came here with Alma and Rebecca last time. We were chatting the whole way, so I didn't pay much attention. We had a blast, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's...not what I'm worried about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We climbed the rockface using some rope, and skated on the ice... It was so much fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That was the catalyst to us becoming good friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This forest will always hold a special place in my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see... Sounds like a wonderful memory. Good friends should be cherished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes, definitely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If we tiptoe across, we'll find ourselves at a field of Stub Rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The ice does seem solid... You're sure it's safe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes, watch me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hey! Lisbeth, be careful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Just like Rebecca showed me... Easy does it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>See?! I made it across! Alma! Rebecca! It's all thanks to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We're almost there. I'm positive that at the end of this path...is the ice mirror that reveals the one you love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(I wonder who Dias might see in the mirror?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(He did say that there's someone who is very special to him. It must...be her.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(My chest...kind of...hurts.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh? Where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hm? Dias? Where did you go? Dias?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ugh... What is that weird smell? Smells kind of sweet and tangâ€”urgh... It reeks! I think I'm going to be ill...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Lisbeth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Wh-who is it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Y-Your Highness! Why are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Lisbeth... What do you wish to attain by giving him Asmodeus? Do you hope that he will love you in return?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What?! N-no, that's not it at all! I just...wanted to be of assistance to him...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Even if he won't love you back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Your feelings are unreciprocated. He does not love you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>To he who desires the Sacred Stone, you are nothing but a tool to be used and discarded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Why do you waver, Lisbeth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You allow these uncertain feelings of yours to cloud your judgment. For 200 years I have protected this ancient relic, and you dare to bequeath it to an outsider?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>My... My feelings aren't uncertain! I've thought about it again and again! This is the decision I came to after considering all possible outcomes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hahahahaha! Very well... If you are certain, then is it eternal love you seek?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>If this man does not return your affections, you will find no flower at the end of your journey, nor shall you ever even hope to escape from these woods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Such hesitation...and yet you claim yours to be true love, Lisbeth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>She's too strong! I'm...going to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Lisbeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Dias...? Where has...Her Highness gone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hmm? Oh, it seems the weeds growing here have a hallucinatory effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>H-hallucinatory?! Then, none of that was real? Well, that's a relief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(The smell has faded. Has he been watching over me all this time?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(Actually...come to think of it... He's always been like this. He's helped me so many times before, too.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(I want to return the favor!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>(There isn't even a hint of uncertainty in how I feel anymore!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Lisbeth! Here it comes!</td>
</tr>
