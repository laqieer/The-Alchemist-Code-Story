<td>That's right. They never left me!</td>

<td>Tch!</td>

<td>Sol... You shone light upon those of us who were forgotten by the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>278</td>
<td>And you and the Templars gave me something I'd never had before: a purpose, and a will of my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>That's why I can keep going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>

<td>How conceited! You can't take all the credit for this magnificence, God!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>310</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>God is dead!</td>

<tr>
<td>312</td>
<td>But perhaps I can yet atone for my mistakes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>313</td>
<td>What are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>314</td>
<td>Perhaps I can still compensate you for all I've taken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You didn't just take. You gave us what we asked for!</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>I... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>It's time to end this charade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>326</td>
<td>Sorry, but you must have the wrong program. This play is just beginning!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>327</td>
<td>You know, I still can't bring myself to believe in God.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>328</td>
<td>Even when She's standing right in front of me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>329</td>
<td>I'm afraid I won't be indulging you for much longer. This is where it all ends.</td>
