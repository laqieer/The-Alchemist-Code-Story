<td>She'll make bread of our bones ere the day is done!</td>

<td>B-b-bread?! No! I'm too young to die!</td>

<td>Such hubris. If you're here to posture, perhaps do it out of my sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah? Looking at your cowering henchmen I'd say you're just about ready to bolt, too.</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Not too late to call for more backup, you know. Not that it'll make a difference!</td>
