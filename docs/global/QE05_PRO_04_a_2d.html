<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You cannot defeat me. Quit while you can, little boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why you...! Freeze Over!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You can't just insult people like that and not expect to be—huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>She's...gone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Why do you keep on fighting despite such a clear gap between our skills?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Behind me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What is the reason you become so emotional for his sake? Is this Dias so important to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>He is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I am who I am thanks to Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Even if Dias never notices me, I want to be helpful to him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What...? Who is this Dias to make you care for him so? What is so great about him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I've got you now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A magic circle...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It doesn't matter how fast you are if you walk into my trap! Now it's my turn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>She foresaw that I would attack her from behind?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I cannot afford to lose! I have to protect Saga now that Tina isn't here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Icicle—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Too slow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wh-what is this?! Black ribbons?! Whoa, whoa, whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I did not expect you to set a trap at the same time as I was doing so. I'm impressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Is this...Ouija?! No, it's different. What is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This is an ancient art lost in time. There are few left alive who know of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Urk...! Ugh, w-wait, what do you plan to do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Like I said, I have no intention of bringing harm to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I have something I must ask Dias Crowley. I only wanted to know what kind of person he is before meeting him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Dias...Crowley? Wait, I think we've had a misunderstanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>A misunderstanding?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Right! The Dias I know is Dias Elysion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm so, so, so sorry! I had the wrong idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's right... He calls himself Dias Elysion now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>When he was in Envylia, his name was Dias Crowley.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Dias? In Envylia...? He never mentioned that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Besides, "Crowley"? Isn't that the name of the great sinner Zeke?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>He was not a sinner!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Zeke Crowley was the successor to a noble bloodline, falsely charged with trumped-up accusations!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I've already said too much. This does not concern you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>B-But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Someone is coming. I do not want to involve anyone else in this. Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>W-wait! Could you at least untie me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>After fighting you, I am now sure of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Lisbeth Finn Lustburg, you are definitely more flat-chested than I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>E-excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Train yourself diligently. Though I am not sure what you could do to improve your...condition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wh-wh-wh-what?! I hate you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What is her problem?! Has she never seen herself in a mirror?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I just... I can't even!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What are you wailing about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Can you believe it?! That girl was so rude! How can I not get worked up—huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I was wondering why you hadn't returned home yet. I don't remember assigning you this sort of training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>V-Voda! Can you unbind me from this—wait, be careful! That dangerous girl might still be around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Dangerous girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I do not sense a hostile presence here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Really?! But she was just here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Tsk, tsk. In any case, Tamis, Fuu, and Tehre should be arriving soon. Make sure you clean this place up before they arrive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Wha...? Wait! Voda?! Oh, come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>This is bad! The mob is about to reach the congressional plaza! Please, we need reinforcements!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Be sensible! They're about to raid our headquarters! Our chain of command will collapse if we weaken our defenses here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Then...what should we do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It was unwise of them to declare their withdrawal from Saga so soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It's clear the administration never expected the riots to grow to such an extent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Lord Dias! Lord Dias Elysion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Who's there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>P-please wait, Lord Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Well, well. I was just mulling over how I could express my gratitude for your help, since I could not find you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Thanks to your assistance, I was able to complete my inquiry. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Huh? W-wait, please! Where might you be going?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Where? I do not understand the point of this question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Will you not save us? Will you not help subdue this rebellion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You expect me, a member of the Holy Guard, to help you? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Wh-why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>The people have intensified their democratic efforts in the wake of the military's debilitation. I understand how the nobility like yourself would feel threatened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>However, this is something you brought upon yourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>If I am not mistaken, this rebellion began the moment Gluttony Foss declared its withdrawal from Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Was it not the nobility that persuaded the people that it was necessary to take the fertile lands of Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Have you heard of the phrase "you reap what you sow"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>B-but...we—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Then again, the roots of the people's rage are from the perceived loss of the benefits that were to come from the conquest of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>What this means is that both sides of this conflict are guilty of causing strife for the sake of their own greed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You dare ask the honorable Holy Guard to wade into this mess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Urgh...! E-even so, please! Without your help, we're doomed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You may, of course, endure being shamed publicly for your lack of grace and request the Holy Guard to mobilize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>But for this, you will have to negotiate directly with our headquarters in Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>P-please! Wait, no! Nooo!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>What a waste of my time. Even Gluttony Foss does not know the location of the Sacred Stone, Satna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Though that one account of the hidden tribe that holds the secrets of the Sacred Stones' origin was quite the interesting read. It may be worth investigating further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>This Sacred Stone must have guided me to Gluttony Foss for a reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Asmodeus, do you wish for me to contact this desert tribe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Dias Elysion... No, I mean...Dias Crowley?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Who...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You know my old name. Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>There is no need to be on guard. I only wish to ask you a few questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Some questions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>The man you once called brother, Logi Crowley... Where is he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Do the Corpse know where the Mikaboshi has gone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>You?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>You even know the Corpse exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>You know too much. Clearly, you have delved too deeply into our secrets... This is the end of the line for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I would rather avoid unnecessary combat, but...fine. This will save me precious time!</td>
</tr>
