<td>The battle isn't over so long as your enemy lives.</td>

<td>007</td>
<td>What?</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Have you sworn a vow of non-violence or something? You're way too soft for someone so talented.</td>

<td>I mean, how naive can you get? Who the hell can afford to practice mercy and non-violence in Wadatsumi nowadays? Times are tough. You don't always have a choice. Sometimes it's you or them.</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Your business?</td>

<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Killing people. That's what's in demand right now in our beloved Wadatsumi. People don't want to save others, they want to protect themselves.</td>
