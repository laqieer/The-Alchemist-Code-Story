<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>At long last...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I have made it to this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Great Beast Mammon... I stand before you once again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>At last, the people of Avaritia will see their deeds come to fruition!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>My brethren have already breathed their last. I am now all that remains of those who lived in this region!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>My ambition is still unfulfilled!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Show me your power! The power we built!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That which lies between us... Let these days of ceaseless battles be that which satisfies my soul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Foolish...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>How foolish humans are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Do you long for your own destruction to this degree? Are you so filled with despair, Kubera?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You, who was born to the Avaritia Belt—the strongest of the humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What you say is true. We humans are foolish. We're weak. Still!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That is why we want power! And strength! And that is why I have finally made my way to this place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This Dragonslayer that bears the dying wish of my friend, Roh Ku, speaks to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It tells me that with this blade made from the bones of the corrupted dragon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You will be defeated by the hands of we humans, Cursed Beast Mammon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So, you have chosen to perish. Then so be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This land no longer needs the brilliance of Creation. Surrender yourself to destruction alongside my corrupted body, foolish human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huff...huff... Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Are you all right, Benika?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I can't...run anymore... Go on...without me, brother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>As if I could leave you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Lord Kubera is still fighting. At this rate...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The barrier of corruption! Beyond the edge of this world, beyond this isolation, surely...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We'll find a way to heal your body!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Brothe—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I won't give up! I'll never give up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>A dream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I...remember. I was captured by Quence and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I remember this place. Within this barrier of corruption, even time freezes. Is it the cause or effect? If that's the case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Too bad for you, pursuers. I am a man who prepares for any and every situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I made it so that no matter what you may try, the Space-Time teleportation magic will activate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Quence! You're still...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Now then, Pursuers of Truth. Allow me to invite you on a journey back through time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Nimul, your hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Has Quence fulfilled his goal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Could Nimul and the others have lost to him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm losing feeling...in my body...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I see... So I am fated to fade away here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I wonder about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Who's there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Is that important right now? Or have you just given up on thinking about everything to the point that this is all you've got to focus on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That voice... Ouroboros's priestess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No, the Infinite Serpent itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That's not important either. There is only one thing that's important here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yna, don't you want to change the past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wh-what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>This familiar sound... It can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Huh? Where am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Why am I in the Acedia Belt Region?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>And where is everyone? Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Is this... one of Belphegor's earthquakes?! And the clocktower is still standing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>This must be the past!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Which means...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hic...hnn... If only I could do it right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It's all right, Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Failure is part of the experiment process. What's important is learning something from it and making use of what you've learned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Hehe, what to do with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>This really is the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Which means...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Exactly. The power to change history. To go back to before the Cursed Beasts were born and rewrite that which caused this suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>So this is how it is, then? The time I wanted to redo... It starts here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Well, well. Look who it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Urgh... Where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You're finally awake, little lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Andechs! But... Where is everyone else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>No idea. I also woke up here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Unfortunately...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>We don't exactly have the time to search for everyone else right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Grooooooooooaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Grrrraaaarrrrgghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>This is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>(This is the day I first came to the border. The day I learned to fear those two Cursed Beasts!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>In that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>The person lying here is me. That day, I fell from the ship and got swept to this border.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>And I saw...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>So this is the past after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Andechs, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I understand. I've thought the same thing before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I had been there when the Invidia and Ire Belts first mixed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>If I had been able to be destroyed along with the Cursed Beasts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>All those people might not have lost their lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I get it. We may not have chosen to redo it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>But we still can't ignore the tragedy, the disaster happening before us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>If we were to defeat them, or... His Highness could also...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Andechs! The Leviathan is—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Damn it! Well, I'll protect you for now, little lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Mesarthim! Emergency procedures!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I see. I regretted it that much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I didn't realize it myself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>The fact that Emmel became the Vessel of Purification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>But why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>The Vessel's role is to take corruption into themselves. By taking on that role, she could no longer stay with the brother she loves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>And yet, she still chose to. Why did she pick the harder path?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I don't understand. I don't see the meaning in that decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I suppose I didn't understand it at the time... But now I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Emmel just wanted to be of use to Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Where am I?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>That's right! We were all caught in Quence's Space-Time Manipulation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Emmel...! Anyone...?! Where are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Wait. This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>This feels familiar. Is this the place from my dreams?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>What is going on? Why would Space-Time Manipulation lead to this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Because it failed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I'm Bianca. Right now, I might not be any more than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>(This presence...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>(She acts as if she owns this place. Could she be like that other woman? But...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>What do you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>You want knowledge? Good. That, I can handle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Honestly, I was worried for a second there. I wouldn't have been able to give you anything if you had said "I want power!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>See, that's no longer my job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Your job...? You're...going to give me knowledge...? Just who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>What you want to know about right now is...Quence of the Infinite Serpent, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Or, maybe, the whereabouts of your sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I would like to know about both, if possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>How direct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I honestly thought you'd be the unbelieving type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I've failed because of things like that too many times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Wonderful. Failures make a person grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>That's how humans grow, by repeatedly running into stumbling blocks that they can grow from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Anyway, if I ask who you actually are, you won't tell me, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Hmm... Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I guess the answer to that is that I can't, yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Just like I said before, I'm just li'l ol' Bianca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>I don't have any other name or purpose yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>So what do you see when you look at me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>I don't know how to answer that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>(Now that I think about it, it's strangely hard to be antagonistic towards her.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>(Up until now, any time I came into contact with someone unknown to me, I'd unconsciously ready myself to fight.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>So, why aren't I...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>No, it's nothing. More importantly, I have some things to ask.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Where is this place? What exactly did Quence's magic do? And where are Emmel and the others?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Firstly, this is the Shell of the World, the central area of all Belts that you have stepped into—thus gaining power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Quence's idea was brilliant: returning to the "beginning" to take down the Cursed Beasts. If it was successful, it would have fixed everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>But...he made one mistake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>The beginning he was aiming for—"this world"—didn't exist in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>So, that magic lead to here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Since this place is beyond all the Belts, it would be the beginning of everything, wouldn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>That doesn't make sense! Quence and the Abstinent Witch, too... They both have memories from before the Belts' existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>If what you say is true, then his memories had to have been fabricated as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>What's this shaking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Uh-oh... I know what's happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>What's happening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Well, this is a problem. I don't really have a lot of power at the moment, you see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>So, Nimul, could you lend me a hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Not until you explain some more. You're supposed to impart knowledge, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Where did you even learn my name, anyw—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>What are they?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Um, I'll tell you, but you know how to fight, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Fundamentally, they're shadows, but they act like just like your regular Fallen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Hmph! I suppose it can't be helped.</td>
</tr>
