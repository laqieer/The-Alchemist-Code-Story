<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Toritoh... Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Haaaaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Did we do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Lucifer's presence is weakening... If we hurry, we could—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Then hurry! Maybe your wish can be granted now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Lucifer, I'm not so full of pride as to claim I can permanently seal you away...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But no matter what, I want to save my friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>In that, I have overwhelming confidence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Even just for a moment, lend me your power...Sacred Stone of Pride!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Where...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Kanon...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lakina?! Why are you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I finally got to see you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Lakina, you... You're disappearing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Heh heh. I overdid it a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But that's all right. As long as I can return you to your world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Lakina... Why do you always do things like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's my way of thanking you for saving me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>And this...is not the last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Maybe we'll have the chance to meet again someday. I don't know when, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But it's okay to hope for that much, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Forget maybes... It's a promise—just like last time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Lakina! I... I did it! I saved the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Impressive as always, my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'll see you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Let's have some tea next time we meet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You saved me...again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If I go back to the other world, what will happen? Will my body even move?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I don't have time to worry about that right now. This soul that she saved and the path she opened...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Compared to her loneliness, my indecision is such a small thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(Since I got out, I'm sure that Captain Kudan will make it back, too.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Time to head back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I pray that I will be able to save the world again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Next time we meet, let's spend even more time together, Lakina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Did it go well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yes, I'm sure it did. Thank you, Toritoh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You don't have to thank me. This is why you summoned me, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Well, yes, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It was only a short time, but I really feel fulfilled; even more so than when I was alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That's why I'm saying that I should be the one to thank you, Lakina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Besides, why are you talking like this is the last time we'll meet? That's not right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I mean that since our souls didn't give in to Lucifer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Perhaps one day, when you get summoned as a phantom, I'll be summoned as one too, and we can meet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>That would be nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>When that happens, can we have tea as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I-I mean, I risked everything for your cause, so I figured I should be allowed to ask that much of you, or... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Heheh. Thank you, Toritoh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>To think I would get to make another friend in such a situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>There was a point when I detested what fate had in store for me, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>This fate isn't so bad. Heh heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hey...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>We'll meet again, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>In our fated future.</td>
</tr>
