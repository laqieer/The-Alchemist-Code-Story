<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>We have much to do. But it will be done! We will cleanse Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We need to be careful, as there's no time to fumble about in the dark. First, we'll need to think about how to fight on an even playing field with the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>And that means recovering the sacred art of Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Right. And the best way to go about doing that is to search for...well, me. My stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The Spirit Stone Mikaboshi... That's our top priority?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes. There are some things only it has ever beheld, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But if I'm able to fuse with it, those memories will become mine, and we may be exposed to strategies that we'd never previously considered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>With my consciousness inside of you, you're the only one capable of seeing those memories right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But if I fused with the stone, I could share them with Logi, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You mean he'd be able to share your consciousness as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes. We must have Logi learn of everything that's happened here. He needs to know of the blood that's been spilled, and what it is we fight for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And by sharing my consciousness, he would also be able to learn Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see. What does it take for you to fuse with the stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>After placing the stone, you'll need to will me out from within you through prayer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It might not sound like much, but it's going to require great resolve and mental strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I've been a part of you for so long, it'll likely be extremely difficult to separate us now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Much like losing a part of yourself. Do you think you can manage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I can and will endure. I'll do whatever I must, for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Which means we have two steps to recover Kagutsuchi. We must find Logi Crowley, and we must find the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>There's a third step, too. In order to stand a chance against the demons, we'll need the Treasure Blade Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Its recovery is equally crucial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ah, of course! It only stands to reason that all of the Sacred Three would be required to overcome our current predicament.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But Sumeragi remains broken, and moreover, is allegedly kept is Castle Aquila Rubrum. How are we to get it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's not something the two of us need to deal with alone. There's another who knows even more about Sumeragi than you, remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Jubei...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>As you say, though, simply recovering the blade won't be enough. it won't return to its true form without being reforged in the flames of Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's why you must recover both Mikaboshi and Kagutsuchi as well. It's the only clear route to victory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>So even if your actions alone don't save Wadatsumi, they'll provide the essential first step to doing so. Don't ever underestimate how important a role you're playing here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I won't allow the demons to control Wadatsumi. Mark my words: I will cut down this Malice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And to do so, I must focus my efforts on collecting the Sacred Three of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Precisely. The goals are plotted. All that remains now is to connect the dots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>And the lines formed will serve to be Wadatsumi's salvation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We have much to do... But if we take things on one at a time, our path ahead will become clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I see now what must be done. But before departing Wadatsumi, I must meet with Jubei!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>When speaking of first steps, that shall be the push to get us moving out the door.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>And so I left the recovery of Sumeragi to Jubei, then put Wadatsumi behind me for a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I traveled the nations of the Continent of Babel to gather information...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>In search of the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi, so that the spirit of Mikaboshi herself could fuse with it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>And in search of Logi Crowley, that I may help impart upon him the sacred art of Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Once these tasks were completed, the true fight was to begin. But the path to get there would be long and winding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I had difficulty picking up Logi's trail, but I learned many things about Greed Dike while I was gathering information about Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>For example, I learned that one known as the Sun King has been controlling the nation from the shadows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>And behind him were the Veda Templars...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I traveled far and wide to attain the information I sought, even venturing to Lost Blueâ€”though there was little to be gleaned there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>But acting upon a tip that suggested Mikaboshi was in Greed Dike, I stealthed my way into its inner sanctum.</td>
