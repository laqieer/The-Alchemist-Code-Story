<td>Whew... Made it! Seems like you never change, Roxanne.</td>

<td>Siegfried?! When did you get back to Slothstein? Why didn't you tell me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's a long story. I tried to meet up with you, but your colleagues told me you'd gone undercover. Then, when I got back to the inn, this guy was missing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Who's this? He... he's not your son, is he? You don't look alike and he's a tad too grown...</td>

<td>I was in this village investigating aggressive wildlife. One thing led to another, and Soren—the speaker of the village—ended up the target of kidnappers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So you came here for leads.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yeah. I'll tell you more later. Not the best place to be lingering about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I gotta say, though... you're a lot more capable than I imagined, Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Dear me. I don't know how he managed to find the children AND evade most of the thugs this whole time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hehe. I had some help from a little friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>"Little friend"...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(Um... it's not what I think it is, right? He's too innocent to be a mobster...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Come on, we have to keep moving. We can catch up later.</td>
