<td>Wow...this is amazing! These mountains of Alkaroid scraps go on forever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's almost like an Alkaroid graveyard. What a tragic sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yep. But...it might be possible for us to give meaning to these androids who've been sealed and labeled here as scrap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If we can extract information from them...it'll mean that at least they'll have served a purpose by being useful to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Right. In every age of humanity, it's always been the role of those alive to give meaning to the dead. How's it going, Alkemono?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>They've all been intensely damaged, aye... They must've been treated...roughly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Allie...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It'll be nice to give them one final moment in the spotlight. What kind of android are we looking for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>One that still has its head circuit, aye. A good place to start is checking whether it still has a head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Actually...now that you've mentioned it, most of these androids don't have heads.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I wonder if the heads sell at a high price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ronnie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I-I'm kidding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But...there's a possibility they're being recycled for further use. Look at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>A-a Hound! Not those blasted dogs again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Aye, I'm sure it's collecting circuits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's equipped with a Gatling gun. It's probably the guard of Scrap Mountain. Best to avoid it if possible, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That android it's got ahold of...is completely intact!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yep. Looks like we've got no choice. Let's drive that annoying dog away!</td>
