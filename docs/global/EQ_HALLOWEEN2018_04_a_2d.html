<td>I can't believe they picked a fight at a time like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Well this just proves how much we need to focus on security as much as decorations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Let's hurry and catch the Ratty so we can finish our preparations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If you think about last Halloween, then of course they are excited about this year's celebration, but that level of enthusiasm is dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well, it is Halloween. If people see a Ratty running around, they'll probably think it's just a child in a costume, right? Let's not make a big scene. Just catch it, quick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh, right. Well, if we're capturing things then leave it to me. I'm the one who brought them here after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Indeed. You are the right person for the job. All right. Hozuki and I will go back and continue decorating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'll go with Melda!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hozuki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I can't just stay here. I was the one who caused Melda to bring that Ratty here in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I have to do something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I understand how you feel, but leave the capture to Melda, please. She's a beast tamer, so it is her specialty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's right. While we wait, let's work on decorating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We'll paint the town with flowers and have a glorious Flower Halloween, but we can't do that without you, Hozuki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's all right. I'll be back soon. When I get back, I'll do it properly. All of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>All of it? There's no need for you to do it all alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But Neica... You really managed to take control of that Ratty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's why, I won't loâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Enough, Hozuki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Do you really believe that forcing your will to fruition, no matter what, is always the right thing to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hayate, Neica, there you are. I was looking for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Alexis? What's wrong? Weren't you going to wait in your room?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah, about that... There's a bit of an emergency in motion. One of Elizabeth's experiments...went wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>For now, just hurry up and come with us! Magnus is pushing them back, but we need more help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If we don't hurry, those slimy, wriggly things will leave him all gooey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's just...somewhat...shocking to see. Anyone who already knows about what went down last year...would be a welcome, helping hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I can't really imagine what might be happening, but if Magnus is in danger, I'm not going to just sit around here. Let's go, Neica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>A-all right! Hozuki, Mei Fang, Melda, please take care of the preparations for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Will you two just calm down and talk it out, already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hmph. I'm calm enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What are you being so stubborn about, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm not stubborn, I just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Enough. Do what you will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Mei Fang! Come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The Wadatsumi art of flower arrangement is just as incredible as it was when I was alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I always thought it was an under-appreciated art. I admired your ability to demonstrate your sense and will through it, Hozuki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I thought that you, of all people, would be able to create a Halloween the likes of which no one has ever seen before, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I seem to have overrated you. Go and set mousetraps, or whatever else suits you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Tch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hozuki!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You went a bit too far this time, Mei Fang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>If I don't say it clearly and firmly, then it won't sink in. In any case, are you going after her or not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Got it. I'll be right back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hmph. What a bother all this is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Such beautiful flowers in bloom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I don't usually have much of an interest in flora, but seeing such beautiful flowers really does calm the soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'm sure the flowers you arrange are beautiful, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Melda...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Can you tell me something? Why are you so fixated on having everything so sparkly? What is your goal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Flowers in bloom have no rival, but if the town is decked out in sparkles then I can still fill the hearts of the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>If it's sparkly, then everyone will be happy. They'll consider it beautiful, even if it's all fake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Even if there's nothing to it but the empty, sparkly shell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Ho...zuki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Melda... Neica really is amazing isn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>She's been able to use such amazing magic like that since she was born, and on top of that, she's so talented at making accessories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Everyone sees her as the real deal...so...I don't want to lose to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I got so wrapped up in that feeling that I caused trouble for everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I see...but why do you feel such a strong impulse to compete?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Aren't you overflowing with talents of your own? You have continued on the flower arrangement tradition by mastering the necessary technique.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It's true that I learned the family art from my father...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>But he...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...! Shush!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Numa! Numa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>The Rattys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Not to be rude, but might we continue this conversation after we capture them?</td>
</tr>
