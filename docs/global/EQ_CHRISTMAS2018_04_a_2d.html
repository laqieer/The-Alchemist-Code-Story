<td>002</td>
<td>W-whoa! He ran away so fast! He just kinda rolled off... Snowmen sure are impressive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>If that snowman was really the one who's keeping it from snowing, then letting him get away was a big mistake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We've gotta go after them! There's no such thing as a Winter Holiday without snow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hey there! What're you guys doin'?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh! Look, it's a tiny little snowman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ah, you must be one of the Maruda children. We are in a spot of trouble just now, because there is no snow for us to celebrate the Winter Holiday with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hence we have come here, to the home of the Maruda Tribe—otherwise known as the snow spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's right! It won't snow! Are you gonna bring the snow back for us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You want it to snow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Of course we do! Who wants a Winter Holiday without snow, anyway?! Right, mom?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh, yes. When you think of the Winter Holiday, you think of snow. There's no separating them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I understand what those fellows were saying, but I do think that they are blowing things a little bit out of proportion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmmm... Perhaps we should speak with some of the other Maruda people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We asked around, but it doesn't seem like there are any more of those extreme types left here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>How come they have the power to keep it from snowing in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, the Maruda Tribe are all snow spirits. That means we can control snow. Duh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We're even more powerful during the Winter Holiday season, 'cause it's our job to protect it! Those guys are taking it a bit far this time, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I heard that all of the snowmen who share those same, strong beliefs got together and performed a ritual to stop it from snowing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>They just wanted to right the wrong of the Winter Holiday, but things have really gotten out of hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>How could they use the powers of our tribe to interfere with our beloved holiday like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The rest of the tribe also seem to think that they've gone too far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I see. In other words, they are not a united front in this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Dear me! Moderates, extremists, and those who waver in the middle... Who would have thought that there would be such factions even in a place like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Who cares about factions?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah! Interfering with the Winter Holiday is a disgrace to the Maruda Tribe! I won't stand for it! Let's go, Yuki!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>H-hold on a—! Oops, they're already gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Should snowmen really be getting that fired up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Who knows?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ahhhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ah! Monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>They look like they're in a bad mood—kinda like they just got woken up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>All this ruckus likely disturbed their hibernation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>H-help us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Geez...</td>
