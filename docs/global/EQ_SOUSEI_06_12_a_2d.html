<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It appears so. It's over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>…Why do you lower your sword, Andechs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Tell your soldiers to stand down. You lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>…We'll defeat Satna, here and now, and put an end to this nightmare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The rest is on your shoulders...as you bear the burden of past sins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Spare me your pity, Andechs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You should understand as a knight. The general who suffers a defeat in battle must pay with her head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Give me a break! You can't use death to escape your responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You dare pontificate on morality while in the same breath you disavow our people!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hereafter, our people will have no choice but to pander to the whims of the Invidians.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You, as our heroic knight, were also the one responsible for the failed invasion of the Invidia Belt, were you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You could claim your motives were pure, but do you think they'd forgive you so easily?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>However, suppose the Knight of Justice defeated the "evil queen" and freed the people from her control. That would be a different story wouldn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Your Majesty…are you saying--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I will play the part of the evil queen. I was a uniquely villainous actor who left a stain on the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If you comprehend my words, then strike me down. My head will be one more "sin" you must carry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>…You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Andechs! You can't possibly be--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I don't care how dirty my hands get…as long as I can save the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>*Gulp*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Quen-- W-Why…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Apologies, Your Majesty. I bet you weren't expecting this, were you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I had always planned on dying, to be honest. Think of this as an eye for an eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>…Quence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oops! Should I offer an explanation? It wasn't just revenge, y'know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>She was even more formidable than I could've imagined. I had to kill her so that she wouldn't get in my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Your Majesty! Queen Terese!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...Sul…va…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>W-We've got to treat your wound…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's alright… Bring your face…closer…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Your Majesty, I…I--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I fell victim…to the law of this land… Just like…my brother. But--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Teres…! Don't speak! You'll bleed to death…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I know that you...will usher in a new dawn for our people…So--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>"So" what!? Why do you always do this!? Why don't you ever explain it to me!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>How can I understand?! I can't...! I can't! *sniff*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Terese! *hic* Terese…! AHhhhHHHHHhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>…Why'd you do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>She already surrendered. You didn't have to kill her. She didn't have to…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But you did it anyway. Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Don't worry. If my plan works, it'll be like none of this happened anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Quence!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Oof…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Impulsive, aren't we? But not too bright. Could you really be the "final key?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, it doesn't matter. I'll settle everything before we find out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I've got some work for you, partner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>…Y…na?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>…Is that you, old man!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hey, old man! What're you doing!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Now, now. It's no use trying to talk to him. As far as he's concerned, time is frozen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It doesn't matter how strong he was mentally. Now, he's a puppet of corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Don't get so upset! I put a lot of consideration into this beforehand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I removed his personality so that you won't feel so bad killing each other. Isn't that generous of me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You monster…! Have you no heart, Quence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>…Good question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I suppose...I must have lost it somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You'll let me know when you find it, won't you? It's probably somewhere in the bowels of hell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…What're we gonna do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>…Tch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I'm the one that lead you all here. This is my responsibility. Alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>…No way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Corruption is what's controlling Yna, so I--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>…Huh? What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Don't go it alone. Let me help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Really? Thanks, Eulalia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>(This is no time to dawdle. I've got to focus on what's in front of me…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Eulalia and I will purify him! So, give us some cover in the meantime!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>If it's a diversion you want, you got it--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Let's show 'em what we got!</td>
