<td>Hmph. So now you have been joined by not only the Protector, but the Holy Guard as well. Lucky you, that you are no longer quite as pathetic as you were. Not that it matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Nnrk! Ah! Ahhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>As long as we have the druidic priestess, there is nothing for us to fear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Now, great Mother, Cryphone! Grant us eternal prosperity! Grant us the peace that we deserve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Heheh... Hahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We should be safe here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes, but we are still surrounded by the Jam outside. This isn't a permanent solution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We've bought ourselves some time to figure out what to do about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I suspect that until Marie can be separated from the arboreal altar, we won't be able to make any real headway in destroying the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Marie... I had hoped, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yes. We failed. We couldn't stop my poor cousin from being corrupted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If only there was some way to save her... I would give anything, even my own life. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wait, I have a question. What is this corruption you speak of? Is it like the darkness of Alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No, the corruption we speak of and the power of darkness that plagues those who use Alchemy are not one and the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Corruption is the result of Sephiron absorbing all of the relentless impurities of the world over years and years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Those who have a particularly high sensitivity to Alchemia are easily influenced by the power of that collective corruption and can become corrupted themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The history of the Sephira is defined by this. There have been many who became corrupted, and were able to overcome it. Alas, there have also been many who were not so capable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Still... I was always told that the Protector's role is to purify such corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Are you saying that Kamui has the ability to save Marie?! Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What is it, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I...don't know that I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I have seen many corrupted by the shadows of Sephiron, but never to such an extent as Marie... This would be my first time attempting to purify one so affected by the curse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You're saying that we might have no choice but to kill her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Dias, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Then what do you propose? The longer we wait, the more that ocean of the Jam outside swells. Would you rather we wait for it to swallow the entire continent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If it comes to that, the number of casualties would be catastrophic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>How many innocents are you willing to sacrifice to save one girl? Will you forfeit the lives of an entire nation? Of the whole damn continent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>In any case, killing her might not be a viable solution, either. The druidic priestess, Marie, has become a vessel for the curse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If she is killed, there will be nothing left to contain the corruption that is now held within her body. Unleashing that corruption would likely be just as devastating to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Then our hands are tied.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Perhaps not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What do you mean? Please, tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If Marie truly has the potential to be a druidic priestess, then she should have the ability to withstand the curse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>With her power and the power of a Protector combined...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It should be possible to transfer the curse to another vessel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I cannot see how it would help to do that. Would we not just end up in the same situation that we're in now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No. We have the advantage of a vessel that cannot be corrupted in the same way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If the curse was transferred into my body, thenâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I could take the curse through the Door of Truth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Meaning that it would no longer affect our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Kamui... Do you...have a death wish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No! Kamui, I cannot allow this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Your Highness, this body is little more than a collection of Alchemia crystals, similar to a Phantom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>For over a hundred years, I have performed my duty to the best of my ability. During that time, I have tried to save as many lives as I could; sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If this is the end of the road I have taken...know that I have no regrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Kamui... I see. I am sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Then...it seems we have a plan. How do you propose we reach the arboreal altar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That hoard of the Jam out there is going to be difficult to get through, even for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes. It is for that reason that I have deemed it necessary to resort to tactics that I would have preferred not to have to employ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What tactics?</td>
</tr>
