<td>Huh...? Where am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The Earth Temple. We carried you here after you passed out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hmm... I guess I was pretty absorbed in watching you guys fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That is incredibly careless. Letting your mind wander on the battlefield is...nonsensical.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>All that awaits the careless is death. This world... Life is merciless like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Your wounds have been treated, but you will need to get your strength up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I can't promise it tastes any good, since we made it with our field rations...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But regular meals are only being given out to the severely wounded, so you'll have to bear with this for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Th-thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, you're awake? That's good. Glad to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm sorry for worrying you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Don't space out like that on the battlefield, all right? Survival is all that matters. Remember that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Um... Who are you guys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Us? We're...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So...you're from another world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Right. We'll find a way home. Anyway, you better eat up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Right! Time to eat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This...is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Not to your taste?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No! It's not that at all. It's just that this reminds me of something I ate with my dad when I was little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>He promised that we'd eat dinner together. It's nice to be reminded of him like this. Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Do you know Lost Blue? I guess there's no way you would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Of course not. We're not even from this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's a city that's not on any maps; a city untouched by the light of the sun. I lived there for a little while. It was just me and my dad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Remembering him is always a bit hard for me... Just kidding! Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Thanks guys! I can't afford to be lying around on the ground. I gotta get up and face the world with a swoosh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>After all, I've gotta complete the Mecha Weapon my dad invented so that I can take down the Giant Taurus! I will bring peace to the world, no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why don't you just get your dad to finish it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I...would if I could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>My dad... He's dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So that's why... Was it an illness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>My dad was murdered. The Holy Guard, who claim to uphold justice in Babel killed him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Then...this world is no less cruel than our own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>In our world, Titans have driven humanity to the brink of extinction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If we want to survive, all we can do is fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Exactly. That's why we joined the Scouts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Eren is my family. I don't want to lose him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It's true... If you wanna protect the things that are important to you, or take them back from those who stole them from you, all you can do is fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>My dad...fought to save everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>When the Giant Taurus suddenly appeared in our world, my dad worked night and day to invent something that could take them down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>At the time, a Philosopher's Stone powered the Mecha Weapon... An item that is deeply connected to the forbidden art of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>By using the stone, my dad broke that ancient taboo, and so they killed him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Why? If he knew that it was forbidden, then why did he...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The Giant Taurus needed to be dealt with! The entire continent was in danger! Wouldn't you do whatever was necessary to stop a threat like that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>My dad wasn't wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The Holy Guard killed my dad for daring to so much as touch Alchemy, but they can't do anything about the Giant Taurus threat themselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That's why I have to take down the Giant Taurus myself. Now that my father is gone...no one else will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>My dad wasn't wrong. His invention wasn't wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I need to show them that. I will show them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I guess we're not so different. If we don't wipe out the Titans in our world, we have no future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Right?! Something needs to be done about those Titans too! I can't afford to be lying around like a sack of potatoes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You don't need to concern yourself with the Titans. They are from our world, so we will be the ones to deal with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Don't be silly! They're in our world now, so that makes them our problem too! Let's tackle this together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>All right. I know how it feels to lose family for senseless reasons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>My mother was eaten by a Titan, right in front of my eyes. I will annihilate every last one of the monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I guess what I'm trying to say is that I know how you feel. I'll help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>As will I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Thank you. Both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>We don't know anything about the Giant Taurus, so I'm not sure how much help we will be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Don't worry! I feel a thousand times better just having your support!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Ah! Your clothes! That guy was wearing the same thing! I guess he must be a friend of yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Ours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yeah! He must be! He was a little rough around the edges, but he was also using that, um... What was it called again? Oh yeah, the omni-directional mobility gear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Don't tell me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>So you've figured it out then? At least he's safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Captain Levi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Judith, please describe the man that you saw, in as much detail as you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>All right! His eyebrows were all stern, and he looked super serious! Kinda like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I guess that's a little difficult to understand... Oh, and he was blond!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>That sounds like Reiner! He didn't introduce himself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I didn't get his name, but he was a good guy! I owe him my life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Titans are troublesome enough on their own, but we can expect at least a few Armored Titans to appear as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Where did you meet him? Take us there. Now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Huh? He's probably not there anymore, you know. I'm sure he'll turn up somewhere eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>It's easy for you to be optimistic about that. You don't know him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You said you owe him your life, but that hasn't been our experience. Take us to him. Now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>A-all right! I get it already! Jeez, you're so scary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Here? Hmph. Prepare yourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Yes, captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Huh? What are you all looking so serious for? I thought he was your friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>He is our enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Reiner isn't a mere human. He is a Titan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>H-huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>That's not Reiner! What is that thing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Be careful! It's a Giant Taurus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>It's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Hey! Did you see that just now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Yes! The Giant Taurus is calling Titans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>What the hell is going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>This is bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Wait! What did you mean? How could that guy be a Titan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Save your questions for later. Switch to omni-directional mobility!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I'm going to tear every last one of them to pieces!</td>
</tr>
