<td>Nope, nope nope! This won't do!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No? I think it's much better than before. Don't be so pessimistic…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's no good unless you say "Delicious!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I need to convince demons that this food is better than eating humans. Otherwise, how can we expect to achieve peace?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>There must be something else I can add. Something...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>…*Chuckle*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What? Did I say something funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No... I just thought, "You really are crazy."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…Obviously!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…Oh! Speaking of which ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Since you can't eat humans, how did you survive before? Did you have some kind of nutritional supplement or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I had life force poured directly into my body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Life force…poured directly? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>How can I explain it? I had someone put their hand on my head…and then my hunger would be satisfied...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>THAT was a substitute for meals...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yes...but I'm not sure what it was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Maybe ... !!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>W-What's wrong Koga...? What did I say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's a chakra! It was a chakra!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I have no idea what you're talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I was too focused on flavor! That must be it… The food I gave you was lacking chakra!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Please explain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I've been thinking for a long time--Why do demons eat humans? Have you ever wondered?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No...I haven't, now that you mention it…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Humans aren't delicious at all! Well, that might not be true from a demon's perspective, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I always thought the meat or blood was important--not the taste...but I was wrong. The important thing was...the intake of life force!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Do you...think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I do! Think about it. Humans also get nutrition from their diet, so demons must be the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What if we provide the necessary life force with chakra!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…I'm listening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>A small amount of chakra is contained in all living things. When a demon eats a human, it also ingests chakra.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...I don't know if it ingests the chakra itself...but it should be a familiar flavor to demons--something they won't reject.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>And if all living things contain chakra--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>…It may be possible to convert that into life force!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I wonder…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>We might as well give it a shot! I've tried plenty of things that didn't work before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Pour chakra directly into the dish. Convert it into life force. Add flavor and...presto! Fusion cuisine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This may be a major breakthrough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Is there anything I can do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We need more ingredients. Can you help me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes, of course!</td>
