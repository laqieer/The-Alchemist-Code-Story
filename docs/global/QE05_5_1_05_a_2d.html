<td>And this weakness is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Dehydration.</td>

<td>Are you being...serious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Absolutely. I believe moisture is imperative for their growth and multiplication.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>That is why experiments regarding the Jam were conducted in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>That land is saturated with the blessings of nature, and has an abundant source of water. Saga is perfect for the Jam.</td>

<td>Come to think of it, the Jam we fought in the desert were nothing compared to those that ran rampant in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>The "Wind" Ouija was able to eradicate the Jam, much like our purification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>This must have been because the element of wind, with its power of circulation, drained the Jam of their moisture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>Even if that were the case, what could we do? Draw Ceclidis out into the desert?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>No, he intends to perform the resurrection ceremony. He won't leave the Sephira village ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/logi.png" alt="Logi" height="128"><br>Logi</td>
<td>Then do we use fire? Wouldn't that evaporate the moisture out of the Jam?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>There's an easier method. We just need a drying agent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/moca.png" alt="Mocca" height="128"><br>Mocca</td>
<td>Drying...agent? Like, those things merchants use to keep their products from going bad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Exactly. With that, we wouldn't have to go through the trouble of starting any fires. All we would have to do is throw it upon them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Even soldiers without powers of purification or Alchemy would be able to fend off the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>But to deal with all the Jam, we'll be needing a large quantity of drying agent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>What about the ports?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>This country imported loads of limestone to be used for fertilizer and construction mortar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>There should be a large stock of lime at the port, should there not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>Limestone? Does that work as a drying agent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>It does. Heat treated lime absorbs moisture and can ignite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>That sounds...very useful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>The port of Gluttony Foss has been active, even though... No, especially because of this country's internal conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>Both the Liberation Army and Gluttony's army have been in desperate need of supplies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>The port has been instrumental for both armies in gathering and stocking supplies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Then here is the plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>We will head for the port and gather supplies, then move on the offensive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>I'm starting to see a ray of hope, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Is this about the morale of the troops?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>Yes. The loss at the royal capital has caused morale to drop significantly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>We may not be able to expect much from them if we force them to march now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>Then I will march with them. I will rally them until my throat bleeds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>Would that be of some help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>You will be putting yourself in danger. Are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>I am the Liberation Army's banner. How can I expect any soldier to follow me if I do not stand at their head?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>I know I am powerless. I have no aptitude for leading an army, nor any means of saving anyone. I depend on all of you for everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>Yet still, I am a member of the royal house of Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>I have responsibilities that only I am capable of executing, and the people will not follow me unless I take these responsibilities on with my life on the line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>Am I wrong, Adelbert?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>

</tr>
<tr>
