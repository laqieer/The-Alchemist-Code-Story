<td>001</td>
<td>Hmph. Once again, my plans have been thwarted. No matter. This still falls within the acceptable margin of error. It's time to focus on the next step in my grand scheme.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You should take a little more time to recover before you rush back. Besides, I've got some questions you might be able to answer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I have no time to waste on answering questions from a small-fry like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Interesting words from someone who couldn't defeat my sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh. It's you. I recall your face now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm honored. Now, tell me... What exactly do you plan to do with the Alchemia Particles you've taken from the therians?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If you are planning to use them for alchemy, you must know that you will bring the Holy Guard down on your own head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ha! The Holy Guard? What could they do, with their false justice? There is no value, only weakness, in fearing the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>My dream is of a new order, one built upon the powers of darkness! Such pitiful peons such as yourselves could never understand what I am trying to accomplish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yet you dare to stand in the way of my glorious duty to bring peace and harmony to this world...not just once, but twice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I will not allow it this time! Prepare to be left behind like the trash that you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ngh?! Please... My life is not so cheap that it can be taken by a sword such as yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What's this, Sir Gerald? You found their boss? Nice! Let me play, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Another small-fry... Tch. Easy enough to crush two as it is one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Heh. Hehehehe. Hahahaha! This is great! I love it! Yes, yes, yes, yes!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This is the best! You're great! You are exactly what I expected from the Hero of Wratharis! You're the perfect final boss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hero of...? Ren, stay on your guard! He's stronger than you might think!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What are you even saying? You didn't even know he was the Hero of Wratharis until I told you just now! Heh. Come on, boss! Let's play!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Gerald! Ren!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I am rapidly losing sight of the usefulness of this battle. Since I have already accomplished what I came here for, perhaps it is time for me to cut my losses and leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Where do you think you're going?! Ren, with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's too late. He's gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Gerald, Ren, are you alright?! Was that...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes. It was that man from before, the one from Wratharis. I think it's safe to say he's no mere pawn. He's most likely behind all of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You may be right... Still, that is something to take heart from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We chased the puppet master off. Now all that remains is to take care of the puppets he left behind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Indeed. Time to end this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh... They're incredible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We've taken care of the kidnappers. Go check on your people. Make sure they're okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That won't be necessary. We looked over them ourselves. Some have incurred injuries, but nothing life-threatening. They are all fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's such a relief to hear... Um...thank you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's over... Whew. It looks like we were able to pull it off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Zahar fought that last battle... The Hero of Wratharis and the man once widely considered to be the next Lord Commander of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>He was wearing a disguise, but he was unmistakable. If you all hadn't shown up to scare him off when you did...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I don't think we could have survived that battle. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's nothing to thank us for. This all is just part of our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I must apologize for underestimating you. I was blinded by prejudice regarding your backgrounds, but it has been an honor to stand on the same battlefield as you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ah... It seems like we are finally gaining the recognition we are due.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I don't think it's going to be as simple as that. For Envylia's official knight order to be saved by a mere mercenary gang...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The nobles aren't going to be happy about that. They're too set in their ways to just accept something like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It doesn't matter. All we have to do is focus on protecting who we can, and maybe one day we really can become a proper knight order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Chief!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ah, Nina. I'm glad to see you unharmed. Go see your parents, I'm sure they're looking for you. Humans... Well. I have nothing to say to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Chief, you...! U-um... I'm so sorry about him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Just go on. Your parents are waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Not just once, but twice... I promise you, I'll find a way to repay this debt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Um... I must ask... How does one become strong...like you? Hypothetically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>A thousand swings of the sword a day, followed by practice bouts. I don't know if it's something you could handle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>A thousand?! N-no way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That much is nothing for someone with an iron will. All of us who stand here have completed that training and more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I-I see... Um... If I practice every day like you say, will you accept the strength of my convictions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hmph. If they're really as strong as you say, perhaps I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>They are! One day, I'll get you to recognize that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That's unnecessary. Now, hurry up. Go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Now it's time to find out the truth, whether these fellows want to tell us or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Oh! Hey, I'm good at that. Soooo... Tell me, friend, what do you know of Philosopher's Stones? We can do this the hard way...or the harder way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Legion, it's time to head back! This battle is ours! We protected the therian village and defeated our enemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Lift your heads high! We stopped Wratharis' plot in its tracks! We protected our country! We protected Envylia! Just as we will continue to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You did well. You have indeed done a great service to your country. Not only have you pushed our enemy back, but you protected the therian village and even saved the Blue Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>There are those who would oppose your actions, even as we all reap their benefits. However... Your extraordinary success deserves nothing less than being elevated to the position of a true knight order of Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You have been known as the Scarlet Legion. To honor the history of that name, henceforth you shall be the Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Th-this is an honor beyond all imagining! We vow, now and forevermore, to dedicate our swords to the betterment of the country of Envylia and the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hmph. These pitiful upstarts have become an officially recognized knight order... Absolutely disgraceful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Indeed. To bestow such honor on that riffraff is beyond the pale. They will probably crumble under the responsibility and force us to drive them out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Ahem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Urk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I was hoping to convey my congratulations for the occasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You are...the Blue Flame Guard from...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>It seems that you still have your detractors, but we of the Blue Flame Guard recognize your strength as a knight order. After all, even we started out less...organized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>From here on out, let us work together as equals to protect the peace of Envylia and, as you indicated before, all the people of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>We greatly appreciate your words. I... We are honored to have the chance to serve Envylia in this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Heh. The lot of you are exactly what we need right now. I suspect that many eyes will be on you to see exactly what you will do in your new role.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Well. I shouldn't monopolize the man of the hour. My soldiers are waiting for me. I shall take my leave of you. Good luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>That was incredible, Vettel! If only Gerald could have been here for that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Gerald...can only ever be himself. I'm sure he has good reason for not being here. Natalie, I suspect we will get a lot busier. I expect I will be leaning on your strength more and more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Leave it to me, Vettel. I haven't forgotten the vow I made once upon a time. I'll be here to support you to the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Brace yourselves! Our commitment to our beliefs has brought us this far, and we have been gifted the opportunity to use our swords to protect the vulnerable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>We will become the sun that gently watches over the weak, in the name of the Scarlet Flame!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>We shall face all who oppose us! We shall never forget our iron will, even as we transition from mercenary to knight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>This is just another step on our path to become the defenders of joy and of peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Scarlet Flame Guard... This is just the beginning!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Are you seriously just going to skip the thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Vettel's better at all that. I...can't seem to adjust to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Natalie's there with him, though... I mean... You okay with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>As usual, you talk too much. The three of us are just childhood friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Huh. Well, if you say so. I mean, I'm sure Natalie's missing you right now, but that's not my business, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>That lovely little lady tries her heart out to keep up with you and you barely bat an eye. Not a lot of people find another like that, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Silence. Now, did you get anything useful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Nothing specific. Might've gone a little too far, too... Whoops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I did find out that the same rumors about Philosopher's Stones have been going around on their side as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Interesting. I suppose it doesn't matter. We'll take them down whatever their plans are, but... Ren...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Yep, yep. Got it. I'll head over to Wratharis and do some more information-gathering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I mean, who else can do what I can? It's gonna take some time, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>It's fine. What we really need right now is more information on what's going on in Wratharis. You'd better bring some good info back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Heh. Alright, Sir Gerald. I'll do that as long as you don't let anyone else kill you in the meantime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Hmph. You talk too much.</td>
</tr>
