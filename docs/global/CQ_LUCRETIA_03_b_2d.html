<td>Queen Lucretia! Did you once again take to the vanguard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Have you forgotten what I told you?! You are this country's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Queen. That is exactly why I stood at the vanguard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What?! What are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What will happen will happen. If I wasn't resolved, I would've stopped being a knight long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Please, then...I implore you! Do not step onto the battlefield anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I am grateful for your consideration, but that is for me to decide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>As your queen and as a knight, I will lead at the vanguard and protect my country and its people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That is my way of ruling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Queen...Lucretia...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I will not accept any objection. From henceforth, do not question my judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That was quite the spectacular statement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Lord Gane...you saved me in the battle today. I would like to thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I am unworthy of your words. I am honored to have served you well, my queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Heh. Your resolve saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Gane, you must also live at your own whim.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>However, take this to heart. I am not a woman who is easily flattered or won over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...Of course. I am well aware of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Heheh. I see. As long as that's the case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(No matter what anyone says, I will do things my way! After all, that is who I am.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(That's right. I wonder if the new dress is ready.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Heheheh. I'm looking forward to it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So, you're visiting the clothes store again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>And it's you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>As you say, I live at my own whim...and I choose to be by your side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>True. I did say that. Oh...well...do as you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes. I shall do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That being said...it's strange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why look at dresses that you won't wear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Actually, I'm here to buy a dress today. I'm thinking of wearing one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What? Are you going to wear a dress? But that would play right into the whims of your varlet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Heh. Not to worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I will wear the dress I wish to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If something were to happen to you...!</td>
