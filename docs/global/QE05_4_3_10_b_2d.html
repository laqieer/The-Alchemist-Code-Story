<td>Hurgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Your Highness?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Finally... After all this time, I have the druidic priestess! With this, we can achieve all that we have ever dreamed! Ha...hahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Grng... Why...? How? I didn't...sense anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I remember you; the girl from Saga. What was your name again? Mocca, was it? I must thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If not for you, I would have never been able to find the priestess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The Wind Ouija... A girl who hails from Saga... She who carries the curse of my brethren... I could smell your curse from across the ocean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Curse...? You could...smell...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes... That curse of yours was like a beacon for the Jam such as us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No matter how far you run, you cannot escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Release Marie, interloper!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Urk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hahahahah! Your futile efforts are entertaining, but ultimately in vain, little king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It was your own father who said, "The weak are nothing more than fodder for the strong!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ma...rie...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Give it up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>L-let...her...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Nngh... O Wind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Pitiful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Come, priestess. I'd rather not be here when the Protector sees fit to show up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Agatha?! Armed with...a crossbow? Did you get that from the stronghold's armory?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That won't be enough! Normal weapons don't effect this enemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I can't just do nothing and let Marie be taken!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Let her go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ah, I had forgotten. There was a more...ungainly one of you, wasn't there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Well, then. Come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Wh...?! What is this light?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Get away from Agatha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Are you all right, Agatha?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Logi?! I'm fine, but we have to save Marie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No! He's...using Marie as a shield?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hmph. So you survived and managed to make your way back here. How unfortunate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Your Highness! Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>How dare you put our king in this state, you cur!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hmph. This seems liable to become more trouble than it's worth. All I need is this one, disobedient little vessel, so I'll take my leave now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hahaha! Pitiful child, if you want to save her so badly, why don't you come and find her? Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We'll be waiting for you in the place where our malice was born, alchemists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I won't just let you run away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Nngh! Not this again! If this is anything like what we saw at the castle—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>No, there are fewer than before! My Wind Ouija should be enough to wipe them out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You Highness, your injuries...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It doesn't matter! What's more important is Marie—ah, my leg...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Your Highness! Somebody call a medic! Anyone else who is free should immediately begin investigating the casualties of the stronghold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Y-yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry. I... I couldn't do anything to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You haven't done anything wrong, Agatha. We should have... If only... Dangit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Logi... Where is Sir Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Ah... Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>He...stayed behind. To give us the chance to make it here. He's...still in the castle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Does that mean—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Ceclidis outsmarted us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But it's not over yet! There must be some way to stop him! I have to believe that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The situation is dire, and only growing worse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>As the Jam cover the royal capital, the military forces of Gluttony Foss fight on in the desert, oblivious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Meanwhile, the Liberation Army is divided and struggling to bounce back after the loss of their comrades. All is going according to the enemy's plan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>But as long as we still live, it isn't over yet.</td>
