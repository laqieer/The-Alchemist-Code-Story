<td>Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ghh! Is this still not enough?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No, it's plenty. Lucifer's shielding is weakened, and the protection around his core is gone. We're almost there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Anti-Curse, reload!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Now's the time, Zavijava. It's time for you to show just what you can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Excellent aim...my son...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But, why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This body of mine is the true Vessel of Lucifer's core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You were far too knowledgeable of Emmel's condition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I started wondering if maybe both of you were in the same boat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You mean...you've been sealing all of the corruption in this land away within your own body?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I have. Fortunately, I have no heart for the sins to affect. I was the perfect Vessel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Father...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If... If you have any parting words, we will listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Live. That's all I wish of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yes, Father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'll take the core now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Do be careful. It is the lynchpin that binds the Shell of the World with the seven Belt Regions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No matter what path you choose, if the core is lost, then the path shall be as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You okay? Still conscious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm...fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'll be...all...right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey, what are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I've temporarily frozen her in time. This way, she won't have to suffer the corruption spreading within her...or anything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It was the plan all along. I intend to let her slumber peacefully until Nimul arrives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Now the question is, what do you plan to do, Serpent Priest? What will become of the Infinite Serpent now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Your beloved master is no more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Priest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>In the end, Lord Shahel entrusted the sacred core to the girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Whosoever bears the Cursed Beast Lucifer shall be regarded as the rightful heir to this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The Serpent shall follow her command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You all certainly do change your tune at the drop of a hat. Though...I guess maybe it's kind of the opposite. No matter how fast the ship you're on is sinking, you're all too happy to go down with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We are devoted solely to maintaining the order of this world, and we walk whatever path will lead us to that end...no matter the travails we may encounter along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I never imagined things would wind up like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Bit late for regrets now. And kind of rude to Emmel, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>She's a strong one, I'll tell you that much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's easy to imagine all the saints described in old folk tales and religious writings as people just like her—all stubborn and full of self-determination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Meanwhile, I'm always just getting caught up in their messes. Short end of the stick, same as ever...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It would seem that I've been defeated, though this form is still operational. No abnormalities detected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It is problematic, however. It's hard to believe the right to control Lucifer would be transferred at such a crucial juncture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Will the Ceremony of Creation fail again, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It should not, given that you have already found the chosen one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Nimul...meaning "Child of God" in the old dragon tongue. Heh. Rather harsh of Nidhogg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I can't imagine he'll listen to what I have to say, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I doubt it as well. But that should be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>To him, we are but a wall he must scale—an evil to be conquered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>After all, the birth of a new era can only be ushered in through the destruction of the old.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Of course. There can be no other way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That is what we settled upon on that day, as well. We will simply have to uphold our roles as troublemakers to the bitter end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Isn't that right, Zafeiris?</td>
</tr>
