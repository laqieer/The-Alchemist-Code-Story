<td>No, it's plenty. Lucifer's shielding is weakened, and the protection around his core is gone. We're almost there.</td>

<td>You all certainly do change your tune at the drop of a hat. Though...I guess maybe it's kind of the opposite. No matter how fast the ship you're on is sinking, you're all too happy to go down with it.</td>

<td>It's easy to imagine all the saints described in old folk tales and religious writings as people just like her—all stubborn and full of self-determination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Meanwhile, I'm always just getting caught up in their messes. Short end of the stick, same as ever...</td>

<td>It would seem that I've been defeated, though this form is still operational. No abnormalities detected.</td>
</tr>

<td>It is problematic, however. It's hard to believe the right to control Lucifer would be transferred at such a crucial juncture.</td>
