<td>…! Sulva! Be careful--</td>

<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Dammit…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I don't understand. What did Terese and King Arius entrust to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Whatever it is, I can't let things end here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That much I know! So…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Andechs! You, who are the most lauded knight in the land--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Deliver us a new dawn! Deliver us hope! And give us time to sort through this chaos!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>May your blade be swift!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You got it, kid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>*Growl*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…I am Andechs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>My desire to save my homeland--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Led me to betray my countrymen. I struck them down, amassing countless sins and corpses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I don't expect any peace for me in the afterlife. I know my sins are too great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'm not dead yet! This is not the end for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Darkened Sword - Hamal! Heed my call!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I, who carry the weight of my sins on my shoulders!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Let me open the path of hope for all who need it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>There! Now's your chance, Andechs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hrrraaaahhhhh!!</td>

<tr>

<tr>

<td>*Roar*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Do you understand, Satna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I'm a criminal--a sinner who doesn't deserve forgiveness. But…I have allies who believe in me, nonetheless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That's why I can fight! That's right. THIS--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This strike, the weight of my blade, this is my people's primal cry for life! Know it well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This Wrath is my justice! It radiates the heat of life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>May it rend you asunder, beast of ruin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Is it…over?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...! Andechs! Satna is still--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…No, it's alright.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>…!?!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Wait, did you use magil to induce a delayed slash?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>It's my special move. I call it…uh…"Death at Dawn Wahrheit!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>…Pff! Do you really need to name it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Oh, c'mon! It sounds cool, doesn't it? Who doesn't want to yell out a cool skill name and go wild?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Did we really…defeat it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yeah. My sword most definitely captured its core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Then let's hurry up and get out of here. We've come too far to let the Ira Belt fall to corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Right. I'll leave that part to you. I'm only good with swords, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Thanks to that sword, a path of hope has opened up in this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>…I hope so. I really do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>…Did you accomplish your goal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>…Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I said what I needed to say. I feel like I've been entrusted with something…very important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I'm not sure exactly what that "something" is…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>But maybe that's okay. There's no right answer… I have to decide for myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I see…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>…Let's live to the fullest, Andechs. For all those who couldn't be saved--for Terese and King Arius.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Well said. I couldn't agree more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…The core…appears uncorrupted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What could this mean? Leviathan's core was certainly corrupted…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh? Did you hear something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Nuh-uh. Why're you looking at me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Never mind. I thought I heard a weird sound just now…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Holy smokes! L-Libra!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What're you doing, Mira! Stop Libra's pressurization!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I-I'm trying! But nothing's working!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Eek! At this rate, Libra's magil will overflow--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>…! Don’t tell me all of Satna's corruption transferred to Libra!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Too bad…Pursuers. I'm a man who always has a plan B.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The Space-Time transfer operation was designed to take place…no matter what…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Quence! How can you still…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Now then, Pursuers of Truth. I invite you on a journey to the past--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Brother, give me your hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…Alright. Let's call it a day, shall we? Good work, everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>…Looks like the town's repairs are on track. All that's left is to await Nimul's return…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…With everyone away--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It sure is quiet…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I never thought I'd miss Adaleigh's antics…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(…Maybe I should've been more insistent about joining them…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No! What am I thinking? Nimul left me to look after this town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>…I need to do more training. Maybe I should practice a bit--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…! Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>…Only an amateur would approach this close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But desperate times call for desperate measures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Are you…? That aura! You're…Zafeiris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Bravo, Seeker of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You, and only you, are unique. Unlike the other Pursuers, you have potential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Potential?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The Pursuers of the Gula Belt are in danger. You must make a choice--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>In order to save your companions, are you prepared to submit your body to corruption?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The world will end, sooner or later. No matter how much humankind struggles or how much we pray...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But…is our fate truly set in stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I can't say for certain. How could I? All I know is--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That decision sparked a change. That much I remember, even now--</td>
</tr>
