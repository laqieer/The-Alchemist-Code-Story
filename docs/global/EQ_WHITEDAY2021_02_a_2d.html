<td>I'm, I'm alive... Thank you, oh, thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What in the world happened here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Welp, I was transporting these here marshmallows for the fair, when alluva sudden these beasties showed up outta nowhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I scurried off in a hurry, but all them marshmallows got gobbled up... Welp, at least I didn't meet the same fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What's the deal here? Aren't these your run-of-the-mill marshmallows?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Just between you and me...these little puppies are pretty gnarly. Create craaazy dependency.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Dependency?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah, just look at these monsters. Probably not great for humans, but whatever turns a profit, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But man, they ate everything we had! How'm I supposed to explain this to that hoighty-toighty noble?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They ought to take responsibility for making you transport such dangerous cargo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Didn't ya hear what I said about profits? Can't stop the rumor mill turning, anyhoo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Now that I've lost all their merch, I bet they'll gimme a real tongue-lashing. Maybe even load some debt on me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>At any rate, I oughta head back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This whole thing stinks to high heaven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yeah. His story, that noble, the marshmallows—don't think we can leave this be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Unforgivable. Let's spank that corrupt noble, make him pony up all the dough on him, and give it out to everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>First, I'll track down wherever he lives, and I'll—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's a bit overkill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Us getting back what's been stolen's one thing; going around stealing ourselves is another, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Overkill? How so? Our foe is a scoundrel. All his money, ill-gotten gains from tormenting the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'm not talking about stealing willy-nilly. Take from the vile rich, give to the needy poor. That's what a chivalrous thief does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Toward that end, I'm willing to do whatever it takes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Even...taking a life, in need be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I don't like killing. If it's to save the destitute, however, I won't hesitate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Murder is wrong, even if the murdered is a crook.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Every human should get a chance to pay for their sins, and start over fresh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I get what you're saying, but that's just idealism. That sort of thinking won't save anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Evildoers who prey wholeheartedly on the poor can't be rehabilitated so easily. Leave him be, and you'll be right back where you started.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Irredeemable villains, rotten men, all the people they hurt. I've seen it all, over and over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Such beautiful idealism wouldn't put food on the table in the Wadatsumi I grew up in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's why I became the Night Fox—why I do things my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Welp, the era we came from was pretty much the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yeah, you're right. It's just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Just?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I was just thinking: the conflict in Wadatsumi never ended, even after our time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh! Welcome back, Tsuru.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That's what I'm talking about! My partner makes quick work of whatever he does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What? Things feel awkward? Between me and him? No, of course not. Right, Creto?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, uh, right, 'course not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>See? Creto agrees. Aww, why're you acting so unconvinced, Tsuru?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hmm, hmm, I see, I see... Huh, is that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What's Tsurubami saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>That marshmallow ingredient comes from Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Toasting the grass makes it sweet; then eating—even smoking the stuff—fosters a powerful addiction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Tsuru remembers some time ago when people used such addiction to wrap unsuspecting impoverished people around their little fingers, so to speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>He thought he got another whiff of that grass, and when he went to check, it lead him to the marshmallows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Addiction... That lines up with the merchant's story. That explains how all the fairgoers were acting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Oh, those were only the first symptoms. They'll recover after a small dose like that, but keep eating them and there's no going back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I don't like the sound of that. We have to handle this, before more people fall victim.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Roger, dodger. Tsuru also looked into where the marshmallows are being made. Hurry, follow us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Evil must be crushed without delay, for the sake of this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>......</td>
