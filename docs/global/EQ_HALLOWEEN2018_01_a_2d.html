<td>First we need to decorate the town, but...does this look okay? What do you think, Neica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What do I think? Well... It feels really different from last year, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yeah! I thought I'd change it up a bit this year and do a Wadatsumi style Halloween. If it was the same every year, it would be pretty boring, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>When I was researching Halloween I realized that it shares some themes with Wadatsumi's Bon, a holiday honoring the dead, and I thought it would be cool to mix and match a bit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, okay. What are these vegetables with sticks stuck in them? They're really interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wait! Don't eat them! That's the horse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's a horse? A...cucumber...horse? Not that I was gonna eat it, anyway!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This time, I want to do a different kind of Halloween that everyone can enjoy anew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I see. Well, I can see everyone being surprised... I still don't think this looks like a horse, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'd like to say I'm ready to begin preparations, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Why is it only you and me?! Last year, there were way more people to help out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Why...? Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What?! Isn't anybody else gonna help with pep duty—er, I mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Prep duty, for Halloween this year?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I've already done Halloween prep for two years running. That's enough. I'm over Halloween.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm sorry. This year I want to just enjoy Halloween. I am looking forward to it, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't mind participating, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We were told to stay indoors during Halloween. Isn't that awful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Not particularly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, I mean, I was in the middle of making a new medicine so it was kind of perfect timing, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Awww man. Well, in that case, since we worked hard last year, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hayate, don't get your knickers in a twist. You've got this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I believe that you guys have what it takes to make this the best Halloween ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Magnus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>All right! Then it's decided! I'm going to be the one to get everyone fired up about Halloween this year!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You were the one who made that big proclamation, weren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I mean, yeah, but...it was all Magnus' fault! He tricked me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>He had you in the palm of his hand, and thanks to you, we don't even have any help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The candy wrapping isn't even done yet! We're not going to be ready in time at this rate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's fine! There's one more person coming to help for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Speak of the devil! Let me introduce you to the one in charge of this year's Halloween celebration—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hozuki! Er... Uh, what's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>This is all wrong! What is with these decorations?! Vegetables? They aren't sparkly at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>S-sparkly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Halloween is precious! It needs to be more, spectacular! I want it to sparkle and shine, indiscreetly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Indiscreetly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>And you, Neica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh? Ye-yes? I'm Neica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I heard from Fujika about you and how you can make cute accessories that sparkle and enthrall people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I-it's nothing that amazing, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Incidentally, what's that in your hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huh? These? These are the candies for Halloween that I'm wrapping.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I knew it! The candy wrappers are amazing! They're so sparkly and wonderful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>R-really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh, I almost forgot to introduce myself. I am Hozuki, the head of the Wadatsumi Three Blossoms School of flower arrangement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I heard not only about you, but also about last year's Halloween from Fujika.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Now that I see them up close, the things you make really are very sparkly and cute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hmph... I won't lose this challenge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Challenge?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>This Halloween will be a million times more sparkly than last year's! I'll make it unique, as only I can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Yes, we need flowers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We'll paint the town with flowers and have a glorious Flower Halloween!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>F-flower Halloween?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Are you done, Hozuki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ugh. How long is this idle prattle going to continue? Let us start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>And these two are...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>These two are here to help us make the best Halloween ever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The woman known as the Empress of Saga who is always out of reach, Melda, and the best name in military strategy from Greed Dike, Mei Fang!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>We need sparkling, talented help like them to make this town shine vibrantly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Why is that nickname still how I'm remembered?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hmph. Vivi is looking forward to this festival, and so, it needs be magnificent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Huh... So, why is that one helping us then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>So...fluffy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Uh...what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>N-no... I said nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I just wanted to help after seeing how fluf... Ahem... How hard, you were working.</td>
