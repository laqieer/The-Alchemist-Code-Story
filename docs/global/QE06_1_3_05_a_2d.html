<td>Burdock, corpses. Spring herbs, toadstools. Cucumber, winter melon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Count to one hundred, and get a demon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's time for the demon parade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The demons are attacking?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes. That's what the scouts reported. There's an army. Approximately one hundred demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I've never heard of demons forming an army before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>A being that can reign over that many demons... Could it be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power. I have no doubt in my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But how?! We gave it such grave wounds and yet it can already—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>There's no point discussing that now. We need to deal with the issue at hand. Where is Ugachi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Just a little late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Can I expect something worth the time you've taken with your tardiness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We've got this, Commander Celis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>All right then. We will lay down a defensive formation around this castle! No matter what, we will defend our castle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But dang, didn't think they'd come for us so soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Something's going on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I thought there was no point in dwelling on things you know nothing about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hahaha, you've got me there. So then, what's our move?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>First, we will march in full company out of the castle town. We need to avoid fighting within the populated areas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Third Squad will then set up a force field. That should prevent the average demon from entering the castle town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>At the same time, other members of the Third Squad will evacuate the civilians. First Squad and Second Squad, excluding Ugachi and me, will be positioned outside of the force field to repel the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What will you be doing, Commander Celis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>To account for the possibility that the Discarnate Power will not be hindered by the force field, I will stand by in front of the headquarters within the force field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What?! That's too dangerous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I understand your perspective, but this is an emergency. If I have to make a decision—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I will always choose the option that saves the most lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Just leave it all to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What about me? What should I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I need you to follow Tanosuke's orders. There is a chance the Discarnate Power will come for you. Tanosuke, keep her safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'll do what I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We cannot let them take our headquarters. This is where we either do or die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Reporting! The demons' vanguard units are nearing the town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Here they come. All units, listen to me! Now is the time to fulfill your duties!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>There is no need to fear the demon rabble! We are foxes, bred to tear through their flesh! With your claws and fangs, vanquish the demons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This is not a fight to exterminate demons, but a fight to defend Wadatsumi! Drive them back with all that you have!!!</td>
