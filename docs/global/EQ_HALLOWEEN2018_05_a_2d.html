<td>Hmmm, some appear to be missing. Where could they be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Nu, numa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Numaaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wow, they're all standing in a line. Incredible. Only the beast tamer known as the Empress could pull that off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I don't really like that nickname.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I think it's wonderful. Everyone knows your power is the real deal, and that's why they give you a nickname that commands so much respect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Even so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Melda, do you know what Hozuki means in the language of flowers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It means...impostor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It may be that this meaning comes from how big the flower appears, while the fruit it bears is so tiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A deceptive appearance... Empty... Fake. All of these concepts are represented by the hozuki in flower language.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I always wondered why my father chose that name for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Was it because I have no substance? Because I'm empty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I never asked him. I was too scared to know the answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hozuki...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ultimately, I suppose I just keep running from the language of flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If my exterior is vibrant and shiny, then perhaps it will hide the emptiness inside of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Was your father really that kind of man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I've always raised my animals lovingly, the best I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It seems to me that you've been raised just as lovingly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I think that maybe your father's true motive for choosing to give you that name may differ from what you believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>His true motive...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh! Those're...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>They're the other Rattys we couldn't find earlier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wait, isn't that the way back to town?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Numa! Numa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh, so that's what they're up to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We really want to participate in Halloween, so we'll sneak into town, numa! If we sneak in, no one will know, numa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's what it said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It said all that in what sounded like two short mewls?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But...if we sneak them in and the townspeople find out, then it'll cause big problems!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That's true. We may need to re-education them some so that things don't go poorly.</td>
