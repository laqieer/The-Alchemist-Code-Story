<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Tehre! We're back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>......So, you've returned. Well done. You can retire for now. I'll relay further instructions to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Got it! Tina, Mocca, see you later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Tehre, as promised...we have obtained a token from Asena. Here it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well done. You returned faster than I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Seeing Asena's state, we understand well what you are referring to. We were naive...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If you understand then that's all that matters. Regardless of the delay, it is still not yet too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We can restore the Wind Matter and relieve Beelzebub from Asena's care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I don't think there's any need to kill Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We will do whatever we can to restore the Wind Matter. So, please...Tehre, reconsider your position on this matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well then, how do you intend to restore the Wind Matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You say you will protect the future and restore the Wind Matter. Noble words. But exactly how do you intend to go about accomplishing these tasks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We-well...we're still not sure, but we'll do it somehow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hmph. In any case, as promised, I will attend the Sprite Trio Discourse. Now, hurry back home and tell Voda and Fuu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Please wait, Tehre! Why did you position Gluttony soldiers at that location?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Why do you wish to know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Would it have been more convenient for you if we hadn't returned?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If we had engaged that number of troops head on, I doubt we would've made it back alive. Who knows what would've happened if Rega hadn't been there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yet, he was. And, as a result, you have returned alive. Shouldn't that be enough for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I am asking you what the purpose of it all was!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I am painfully aware of why you sent us to Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>However, I do not understand why you sent the Gluttony army! For the sake of Saga's future, it is crucial that we hold the Sprite Trio Discourse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yet, it almost seems as if our return was an inconvenience for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The two of you have still not mastered the power of the wind. I am sure you learned a lot from seeing Rega fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Rega has better mastered the power. Was it not a good opportunity to become aware of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...Was it all only for that reason?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Only for that reason? Wouldn't you agree that restoring the Wind Matter is a crucial task? How can you sum it up as something so insignificant?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I will compliment you on having brought back the token. However, your power is still lacking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The power of the wind that the two of you hold is not enough to restore the Wind Matter. I would recommend you start by facing this reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>In fact, would I be wrong in assuming that, without Rega's help, you wouldn't have been able to pass the trial?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hmph. I guess I wouldn't be. Never mind. Now we must first hold the Sprite Trio Discourse. Tell Voda, Fuu...and all the people of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Tell them that, in accordance with the law of Saga, we will hold the Sprite Trio Discourse. We will take Saga's future into our own hands...and witness its rebirth!</td>
