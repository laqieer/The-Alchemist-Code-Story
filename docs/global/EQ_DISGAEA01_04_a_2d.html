<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Thank you for saving my life. I don't know how I can thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No, man! Don't worry about that. More importantly, I've got a favor I'd like to ask...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Cut it out, plip! Don't borrow money you've got no means of paying back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>C'mon! If we can't buy the spices, then there won't be any curry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's true, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>U-um... If you'd like this over here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh dear! What a beautiful silk fabric!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wait! Forget that scrap of cloth. We need mo...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Silence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ack?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>U-um... Is it not to your liking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It absolutely is! I will gladly accept it! Oh-hohohohoh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm relieved. I will never forget your kindness. Well then, please be careful on your way to the castle town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's sad to see you go, but... Take care, Mr. Peddler!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Goodbye, plip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hey! What's wrong with you, Sera?! That piece of cloth is worthless to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This is the problem with muscle-brained monkeys. If we sell a beautiful fabric like this, we can get our hands on some money!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Impressive as always, Madam Overlord Seraphina! Your cunningness is beyond any in all the Netherworlds, dood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh-hohohohoh! Compliment me more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...But wouldn't it have been faster just to borrow money instead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Like I said, it's not good to borrow money without any intention of returning it, plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If we sell this silk fabric, we'll have some money, and all we'll have to do from there is find the spices!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yeah. Still, there's a lot of people here. Everyone, try not to get separated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What a lively town, plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Now isn't that a lovely castle. Well, my Netherworld Gorgeous is far more...gorgeous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Rin, it looks like we'll be able to find you a lot of friends, plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yeah! This place is so lively. It makes me happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So...? Where do they sell the spices?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(This smell...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Sniff, sniff...sniff, sniff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hey, wait! Usalia, where are you going, dood?! You can't go off on your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Now...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh?! What's going on...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Wha?! Hey! Be careful!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What's with all the commotion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh? Usalia? She's missing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I can't see that Prinny either. Did they get separated? Honestly, what a handful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hey, that person just now... Wasn't that the kidnapper who's been making the headlines recently?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yeah. I thought I saw him carrying something...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hey, did you hear that... It can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Was Usalia kidnapped?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Let's pursue him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Dangit! Where did he go?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huh?! Hey! Watch where you're going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hey...do you smell something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Sniff, sniff... This deliciously stimulating scent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It's from this store.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Yeah! What a delicious curry, plip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>U-Usalia... What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh? What's gotten into all of you, plip?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Don't you dare "plip" us! What're you doing blissfully eating curry on your own?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Usaliaaa! I'm so glad you're okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>We were looking all over for you! We thought you were abducted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Oh. Sorry about that, plip. The curry just smelled so good that I wafted my way into here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Sigh... Seriously, what a little handful of a demon you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...So that means...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>The one who was abducted is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>My Prinny?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What's up, dood?! What're you doing to me, dood?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Heheheh! Once I sell this strange talking bird, I'll be rich!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Aghhh?! You're gonna sell me, doooood?! Madam Overlord Seraphina, help, dood!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Shut up! Keep it quiet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Wha?! Wh-what's this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What is it this time? This town is super action-packed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>More importantly, right now our priority is my Prinny! How dare he steal my servant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hey, did you see a man clutching a weird bird that speaks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yeah...he just walked outside the castle walls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Oh my! He's already gotten that far?! That's some agility he's got going for him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Never mind that. You should hurry up and get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>A ton of strange soldiers suddenly appeared out of nowhere! They've surrounded the town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What did you say?! Then...my Prinny...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Right now, the knights are preparing to rush into battle, but I'm not sure they'll make it on time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>This town might end up becoming a battlefield!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>If that were to happen, the people of this town...they'll...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Killia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yeah, I got it...! I'm eating "the town's curry" before battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>All right! Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Revenge for my Prinny...isn't actually all that important to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Madam Overlord Seraphina...dooood!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Oh, you're alive? Too bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I'm alive, dood! More importantly, there are enemies everywhere, dood! I was scared, dooooood!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Yes, yes. I hear you loud and clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I'm done eating. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I'll have them pay the price for having laid their filthy hands on my possession!</td>
