<td>Incredible. Any other person would be dead from so much blood loss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>How could he have been fighting in such a condition?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What are you blabbering on about? If you won't make a move, then—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What's the matter? Can't move?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Three minutes, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What a surprise. We thought you were making bold threats, but it turns out you were just pressed by your physical limits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Heh, you still have no idea who you're up against. Fine, I'll kill you first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ugh...! I-I can't...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Your body cannot handle any more, no matter how hard you push yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Nonsense! Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Don't you dare underestimate me! I am the sun that was born in the sunken city without light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I cannot lose! My destiny is to win!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Let me ask you this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You are holding your life together with nothing more than sheer force of will. What drives you to do so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What are you fighting against?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Heh, all of you have lived such easy lives... None of you will ever understand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What I fight against...is this world that allows inequity to prevail! This whole world is my adversary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Nngh... S-Sol!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The whole world? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>J-just as Sol said... None of you could ever understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Rejected by this world, we were not allowed to exist, let alone survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I bet none of you have ever had to endure such an experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Not even to exist?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The absolute justice you preach is nothing more than naivete. The world we will design will give everybody an equal chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>At least we will not try to compartmentalize people the way you all have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Any and all people will live equally, as long as they have a strong will to survive. That is the fair world Sol plans to design for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>In other words, a world defined by the idea of survival of the fittest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That may be the most natural way of life for all living creatures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>However, that is a state that the existence of human society itself will resist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Today's society is built on the idea that anybody can pursue a life of happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This world maintains a delicate cycle under that idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Your ideals are laudable, but if they were to be realized, they would be the downfall of society.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You trying to say today's society is perfect?! A society in which the likes of us aren't allowed to exist?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Of course we don't intend on abandoning you. There must be a way we can exist side-by-side and—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, no! Captain Othima's spell was broken!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Your kind is always the same! Spitting pretty words, but never really doing anything to change the reality!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I've seen dozens of comrades slaughtered after falling for these honeyed words!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No! I really mean to—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We're tired of these lies! I will only believe Sol, and follow him as he fights on, for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Us...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>He will never stop fighting for we who have fallen through the cracks of society!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>He never gives up! He's our light and our hope, the sun for all of us who were cast out of your world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I will not let you get in his way!</td>
</tr>
