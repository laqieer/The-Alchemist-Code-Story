<td>A permit? Like I said, I'm a guest of Orion!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We've been informed not to allow those without a permit to pass. If you want to get through, then bring a permit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Look...we're actually going out of our way to assist Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Seriously. Go tell your superior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hmph. Enough with your cockiness. You lot who don't even have a country of your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If you think we all welcome you with open arms then you've made a big mistake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What did you say...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Look over there! There are Greed Dike soldiers at the barrier! No way... Could Wratharis already be...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But the torches haven't even been lit yet. Do you think they've just arrived?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Perhaps. In any case, we must quickly infiltrate them and grasp the situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Like I said, we're not letting you through. Come back when you have a permit.</td>

<td>Only by keeping an eye out for those under you can you become capable of ruling the world. At this rate, your general won't be very successful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What did you say?! Say that again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>They seem to be having some kind of dispute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Now's our chance. Let's make our way through the opening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Keep up the good work, soldier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh? Hey, hey, you're just gonna let them pass? They don't have a permit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>They're clearly our soldiers! Or are you blind as well as dumb?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Tsk. I could ask you the same thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If you have business with Orion, you'd better look elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No...we were just summoned by our captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ye-yes! We're actually quite late. Come on, let's hurry on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry. I looked back involuntarily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Seriously, my heart almost dropped for a second there. Anyway, it's fine. Let's hurry on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey wait! You lot...you're not allowed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh, by the way...you just said something quite rude, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That you don't have a country of your own? Hehe... How else am I supposed to describe you lot?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I personally don't mind, but you're insulting my friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I can't let that insult go by. Now you'll have to pay the price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh...? Ugh...?! Ug-ggh...?! Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm bored of here now. Let's go and pick up our reward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What a relief! There still aren't that many casualties!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This isn't Greed Dike's main army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Their invasion of Wratharis seems like it was just to cause a commotion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Captain Othima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The way he was talking...do you think he realized we were outsiders?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Um...are you talking about the man we just passed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yeah. Anyway, let's go and get our men.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Seida...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Captain Seida, what are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Right after you launched your attack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Greed Dike's main army appeared in Northern Pride! Come back as soon as you can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...! That's not good... How did they notice us?! We've been surrounded!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
