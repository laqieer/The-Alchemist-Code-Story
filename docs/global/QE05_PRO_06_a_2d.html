<td>Edgar! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Y-yeah. Thanks for that, little lady. I couldn't have made it through that without your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I can't believe you... Look at this, you're flirting while on the verge of falling on your face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yeah, you're all pale! You sure you're all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I mean... Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Liar!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>All you did was lie around! I saw how you made Fiona do all the work, asking around, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Fiona... Seriously, don't you think it's time to give this little guy a tune-up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Can we move on to more important matters? For example, did you hear anything interesting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ugh. Right. So, turns out it's just as you said, robo-wrist!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>According to the history books, it disappeared when Wadatsumi was destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Then...we've run out of leads on where the Mikaboshi might be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>See? I was right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Are we sure that girl wasn't just trying to study up on historical events?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I don't know if I can believe that. If it was just for research, there would be no need for that much fuss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's true...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Think about it. After Envylia became one with Northern Pride, things have been suspiciously quiet, but in truth, Envylia itself has disappeared from the history books.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Like we talked about before, even the succession disputes in Lustburg were related to the Sacred Stone, Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Then that incident with the dragon in Saga all started with the fuss over Gluttony Foss' Sacred Stone, Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's what the rumors say, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In other words, what's happening here in Slothstein...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Can't you see? Those who live on this continent of Babel worship the Sacred Stone, but those Stones are stirring up turmoil in this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh... I see what you mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Now, suddenly, there's this girl who's searching for the legendary Mikaboshi and, if our information is correct, the Paladin named Dias is heading in the same direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I can't believe that's just a coincidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I only really got one useful thing out of all that time spent staring at history books.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's an old legend about the Sacred Stones that says...that the Stones can somehow communicate with each other. With the state of the world as it is, they're probably reaching out to each other right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If the Mikaboshi really has reappeared in this world...and if that girl gets her hands on it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I can't just sit idly by and wait to see what happens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What's your plan? You gonna chase that girl? Go all the way to Gluttony Foss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Nah. Even if I try that, it's not really going to get me anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Then what are you thinking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You're... Oh. You're thinking to go back to the beginning and pick up whatever clues you can find.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes. There's got to be something we missed that will lead us to where we need to be!</td>
