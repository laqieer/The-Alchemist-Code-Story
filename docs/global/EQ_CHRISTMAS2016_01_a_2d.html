<td>Phew! We're finishedâ™ª</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It was surprisingly fun. I think it's this scarlet costume that makes me so excited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yeah, this costume is really cute as well! Santa Claus is great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>By the way, was Santa always part of your country's culture? Apparently, he's a recent addition to mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm not sure. I haven't thought about it much. These days they celebrate the holiday in every country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What about you, Lofia? It's easier to imagine Santa existing in your magical kingdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hmm, I'm not sure when it started. But...maybe that's because Santa actually exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What do you mean Santa exists?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I mean, for our mission, we delivered gifts to the homes of underprivileged children from different countries, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Lustburg wasn't on that list. Doesn't that mean there's someone else besides us who's distributing gifts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Now that you mention it, it makes sense. So the real Santa Claus is in Lustburg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Really?! I really wanna see him! Please, please! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Seriously? We've finished our mission, so let's just go home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Precisely because we don't have any mission, it's the perfect time to go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes! Lustburg is close to where we are now! Let's find Santa Claus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No... I want to go home and have tea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>How about we go to Buche de Noel, the best cake shop in all of Lustburg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'll even buy you gingerbread cookies and pudding, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sigh... Fine. I can't win with you ladies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well then, off we go to find Santa!</td>
