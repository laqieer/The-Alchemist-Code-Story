<td>Hahah! You can't kill them, can you? You're a naive little brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ohh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That's the weakness of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You can use those that are dead as Phantom Soldiers, but witches can control the living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>A battle is established when one's life is on the line. One who uses the dead to fight does not know what true risk is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You failed as a witch. You lack experience as you cling to your Alchemy. You are nothing more than a pestilence that threatens to harm our country!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If a witch is someone who manipulates others who don't want to fight...then I will gladly not be counted amongst you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Originally, I was always a failure. I don't know the traditions of being a witch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I am not tied down to such things, nor will I let the country be bound to them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Enough with your talk...! I'll make you never able to speak again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wh...what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Salomo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Stop messing about! Take me out...while you have the chance, Lisbeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Do-don't be stupid! I couldn't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're the one that's stupid! We Bugmails...have dedicated our lives to changing this country! Countless of us have died...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You once said to me yourself...that you couldn't let your friends die in vain! Don't let me...Lisbeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Agh! Le-let me go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Lisbeth...you said to me before that, like me, you had experienced defeat after defeat. You know what it feels like to be wounded!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I have dragged these wounded men this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>At the very least, I've shouldered the resolve of those who've served under me. Now...it's your turn to shoulder this burden!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Salomo...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>As someone who has lost over and over again, you understand, right? You don't want to see the person who defeated you easily defeated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You're not so weak that you would lose here and in such a cowardly way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You can do it! You can kill me...Lisbeth! Go beyond! Carry us with you to this world's future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Uya...hyaaaaahhhhhh!!!</td>
