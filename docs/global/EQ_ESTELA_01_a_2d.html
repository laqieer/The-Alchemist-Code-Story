<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>You want me to fortune tell about Slothstein's future with mechanical engineering?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. That is why I wanted you to come to Slothstein for this reading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I see…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Is that strange?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Not at all. Although for the most part, people ask to have their own fortunes told.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Usually because they need some sort of direction in their lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I don't need to know my own fortune. I'm already retired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Instead I'm curious about how this country will move forward with mechanical engineering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes. Magic engineering can that benefit the people, and there are some drawbacks with machines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Is it right for the world to move in that direction? I'm just not so sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But I do like machines. So I'm hoping that there is a brighter future for technology.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And that's why you're requesting for a reading. I understand. Alright. Let's have a look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see…a dark shadow…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A dark shadow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes. It's looking for a great confrontation. There will be a big festival soon, won't there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It is there that it will take upon a wish…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>A big festival… No…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It can't be… Everyone's been working so hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>The festival is expected to change the course of mechanical engineering. And there's nothing that can be done?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The future seen through fortune telling is a temporary vision. Efforts can be made to change its course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If you want to change the future, I'd have to look further and deeper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Please! I would like to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Certainly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It seems…the central person is feeling extremely nervous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>She is impatient and her feelings are spreading to people around her, and so the others are pushing themselves too hard. And then disaster…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>She… Ah, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Thank you. I think I understand now. I have to tell him that the problem must be solved…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But even if one problem is solved, another one may appear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Confusion, anxiety, bewilderment… All are within her heart. Without resolution, the dark shadow will continue to control her</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I see… What is there to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hmm… Estella. Could you stay here for a while as a fortune teller?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Of course, I will pay extra for this service. I'll also prepare a place where you can do your readings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Please. There are people who need your assistance in fortune telling here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(This is a difficult situation. I usually don't stay in one place for long periods…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>(Staying in one place will make everyone around become completely dependent on fortune telling...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(I didn't want to be part of that anymore, so I decided to travel. Also…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I understand. Then for a little while, I'll be a fortune teller for this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(It is a "job" at least…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The roles of fotune tellers are to support hard working people…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Those who want to achieve great things have a heavy burden. Mental strength is necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That's why we've made promises with the spirits for their help, so we can support the backs of those who work hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>"We fortune tellers must support the backs of those who work hard!" My mother's words exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>And with that in mind, she used her powers. The secret technique passed down in the family, called "Spirit Divination."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>A long time ago, the spirit that the ancestor made a pact with gave divine protection. This gave the power of fortune telling through the five senses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Surrender the senses to the spirits will grant the truth which nornal humans cannot see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>She slowly started to lose her vision because of the power that was given to her. In the end, she became totally blind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>She was a fortune teller whose eyes were like medals, and she supported a number of number of people with her visions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I was proud of my mother. After her passing, I inherited the contract with the spirits to become a fortune teller like her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>All the people who come for my readings just want an easy answer.. They don't try to act or think for themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hey, mom. Is it really necessary for us to tell them their fortunes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>These people are forgetting to try to make an effort on their own, relying entirely on fortune telling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>This is the shop that opened up recently. I heard the predictions were quite accurate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I had my fortune told and I'm glad I did. I felt like she could see everything, and her advice was accurate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>And while she was talking, it was so soothing to hear. It was like she knew exactly what I wanted…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Really…? I think I'll have to make a reservation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What's wrong, Amis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Actually… I think I should go back… I mean, everyone's doing well, so I don't know what I'm doing here…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Hey, you can't just cancel things. Getting a reservation for this fortune teller was really hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I did quite a lot of work trying to get this reservation for you. You really should be thanking me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But I didn't ask…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>That's not an excuse! You really need a break so your subordinates can also get a break.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>W-well, that may be true, but why to a fortune teller?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I don't have anything I particularly want to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>It's your stoic ways that made me want to bring you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Never mind. So, let's go. I don't want to be chewed out by her for being late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Um… okay, I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Welcome and thank you for coming. You must be Amis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Uh… Yes. Thank you very much. I'm sorry, but I don't have anything I want to know…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Is that right…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It seems you have a strong sense of responsibility…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You are compelled to complete any task assigned with full attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>There is a great and important task forthcoming. Because of it, you'll start to feel unease…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>And then there is a major challenge for the region… No, for the world… And for you…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>You feel extremely honored… But at the same time, there is great responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>It seems you recognize what I'm reading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I do. There is something I'm anxious about. It's on my mind even while I sit here. But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Then let me read your fortune. We may be able to clear some of your worries and anxieties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>We must succeed… The train's fate… No, the fate of a mechanical engineering…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>But... I wonder if it's really going to go well if it takes so much time for preparation. Not only the ceremony, but also for the future…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I can't be this weak-minded if I want to lead others. I have to be focused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>I know that. I know, but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>It's time, Vice-Captain Amis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Yes. If the next ceremony is successful, the train will officially be put into service. I never thought I'd be assigned to be in charge of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Why not? It was essentially your idea as vice-captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>At first, I was told that it was absurd. But I was able to proceed with the research though the help from my boss. And that's how it went.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>This will lead to many people being able to travel far and wide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>It's going to be a future where people will connect from all over the world, through new technology and engineering feats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Thanks to you, vice-captain, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Vice-captain Amis. Congratulations on your promotion as the next director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>The cards show…dark clouds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>The overwhelming burden and enthusiasm together create impatience. You are now placing unnecessarily burden on yourself and those around you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>You or your subordinates cannot undertake this stress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>It starts off as minor, but it will gradually spread everywhere…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>It's like you can see your future, right Amis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>In other words, the situation will improve if I can calm down and pay attention to my surroundings...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Remember that fortune telling is not fate. You can use the readings to change the future for the better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I…see…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Although there is a concern. I have a bad feeling about how things are moving. It seems that there is something missing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>It would be wise to check once more on the preparation for the ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Speaking of that, I already have some subordinates preparing for it. But it might be worth another look…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I have to get going then. Thank you very much, Estella!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Hey! You're just going to leave without your superior? Really...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Well, at least some sense was knocked into her, so I'll let it slide this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I'm glad she is seeing things in a better light. You're looking after your subordinates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Their mental health is also my concern. I learned that from my predecessor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Plus, this ceremony is very important to me. We want to make it a success no matter what. And so...I might be asking for your assistance again later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Your powers are the real thing, it seems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Whenever you need my assistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Hm? I'm sorry, the previous customer was my last reservation for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>You must be Estella. You travel from place to place, reading fortunes that lead toward success.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>You're going to have to shut down this place. Any more of this will cause trouble around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>That's a pretty forceful method, isn't it? Though It's an honor to have think of my powers so highly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>You think that fortune tellers are weak… How shallow of you.</td>
</tr>
