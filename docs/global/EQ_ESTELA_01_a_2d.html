<td>Estella</td>
<td>You want me to fortune tell about Slothstein's future with mechanical engineering?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>Yes. That is why I wanted you to come to Slothstein for this reading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>I see…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>Is that strange?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>Not at all. Although for the most part, people ask to have their own fortunes told.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>Usually because they need some sort of direction in their lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>I don't need to know my own fortune. I'm already retired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>Instead I'm curious about how this country will move forward with mechanical engineering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>Yes. Magic engineering can that benefit the people, and there are some drawbacks with machines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>Is it right for the world to move in that direction? I'm just not so sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>But I do like machines. So I'm hoping that there is a brighter future for technology.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>And that's why you're requesting for a reading. I understand. Alright. Let's have a look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>I see…a dark shadow…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>A dark shadow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>Yes. It's looking for a great confrontation. There will be a big festival soon, won't there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>It is there that it will take upon a wish…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>A big festival… No…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>It can't be… Everyone's been working so hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>The festival is expected to change the course of mechanical engineering. And there's nothing that can be done?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>The future seen through fortune telling is a temporary vision. Efforts can be made to change its course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>If you want to change the future, I'd have to look further and deeper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>Please! I would like to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>Certainly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>It seems…the central person is feeling extremely nervous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>She is impatient and her feelings are spreading to people around her, and so the others are pushing themselves too hard. And then disaster…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>She… Ah, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>Thank you. I think I understand now. I have to tell him that the problem must be solved…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>But even if one problem is solved, another one may appear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>Confusion, anxiety, bewilderment… All are within her heart. Without resolution, the dark shadow will continue to control her</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>I see… What is there to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>Hmm… Estella. Could you stay here for a while as a fortune teller?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>Of course, I will pay extra for this service. I'll also prepare a place where you can do your readings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>Please. There are people who need your assistance in fortune telling here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>(This is a difficult situation. I usually don't stay in one place for long periods…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>(Staying in one place will make everyone around become completely dependent on fortune telling...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>(I didn't want to be part of that anymore, so I decided to travel. Also…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>I understand. Then for a little while, I'll be a fortune teller for this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>(It is a "job" at least…)</td>

<td>The roles of fotune tellers are to support hard working people…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella's Mother</td>
<td>Those who want to achieve great things have a heavy burden. Mental strength is necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella's Mother</td>
<td>That's why we've made promises with the spirits for their help, so we can support the backs of those who work hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>"We fortune tellers must support the backs of those who work hard!" My mother's words exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>And with that in mind, she used her powers. The secret technique passed down in the family, called "Spirit Divination."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>A long time ago, the spirit that the ancestor made a pact with gave divine protection. This gave the power of fortune telling through the five senses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Surrender the senses to the spirits will grant the truth which nornal humans cannot see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>She slowly started to lose her vision because of the power that was given to her. In the end, she became totally blind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>She was a fortune teller whose eyes were like medals, and she supported a number of number of people with her visions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>I was proud of my mother. After her passing, I inherited the contract with the spirits to become a fortune teller like her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>All the people who come for my readings just want an easy answer.. They don't try to act or think for themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>Hey, mom. Is it really necessary for us to tell them their fortunes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>These people are forgetting to try to make an effort on their own, relying entirely on fortune telling.</td>
