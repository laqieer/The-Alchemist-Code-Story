<td>This isn't it. Or this. Or this! Ugh... The bookshelf is a mess again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>People just throw books back on the shelves wherever they see fit. It's unbelievable! They have numbers written on them and everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hm...? There's a book missing here. I'm certain that no one has checked it out—which means that someone must have borrowed it without permission again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I cannot fathom how they manage to bungle even such a simple rule! It is really not that difficult! Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Boo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>E-Emma?! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Sorry, sorry! It's just that you're always so serious, so I wanted to have a little fun with you, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're so cute when you're all panicky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What is that supposed to mean?! You're the one who's always—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Now, now. Polish this, and calm down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A silver spoon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(I really can't keep up with that girl.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(Oh, well. I suppose that I shall have to be the grown-up here.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I always thought it was interesting that you calm down when you polish silverware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't really understand it, either. Haaa... So, what's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Didn't you come here to tell me something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh! That's right! Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Noah? Are you here? I wanted to talk to you about the student council documents... Hm? Oh, hello, Emma! Are you bothering Noah again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ugh... It's you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Don't take that tone with me, young lady! Whenever I see you, you're being childish and undisciplined. You will never become a praiseworthy witch with an attitude like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Whatever you say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry, professor! She doesn't mean anything by it! I'm always telling her to watch her manners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You're such a good student, Noah. You could learn a lot from her, Emma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I hope you realize just how lucky you are to have such a wonderful honor student as your friend here, missy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Despite how busy she is with her work as secretary of the student council, she always cleans up the library without being asked, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Goodness gracious me! Look at this! The bookshelf is a mess! What were you thinking, Emma?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>N-no! That wasn't Emma, that was...me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's fine, Noah. You don't have to cover for her. Emma, the next time this happens, you'll be writing a letter of apology! Am I understood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Honest, professor, I'm not trying to cover for her or anything. I was the one who—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh... She's gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Boy, that teacher really doesn't listen to anything anyone says, does she? Not that it really matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Of course it does! I can't let someone else's reputation be negatively affected because of a misunderstanding! I'll go and fix it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's fine! It always happens, so it's not a big deal. Besides, we both know that I really am here to bother you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Anyway, all of that aside, you want to come eat crepes with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Crepes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I heard about this place at work. Everyone says it's super yummy! I figured that since it's on the way home, we could go together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Emma, what are you saying? You know that stopping at places on the way home is against school rules!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It's fine! Nobody will find out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Emma! All of the teachers have their eyes on you! If you keep going like this, you will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I will...what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>W-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(I guess I'm the only one worrying about Emma's future. I'm such an idiot.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Never mind. Anyway, we have practical magic exercises first thing tomorrow morning, so I'm going to go home and practice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You better not be late tomorrow, Emma! Your reputation is on the line, after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ack! That's tomorrow?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Don't overdo it at your part-time job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Okay, thanks! We'll have to have crepes another time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>All right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I guess I'll head home early today, and go practice for tomorrow in the forest nearby.</td>
