<td>001</td>
<td>Oh... This is a settlement of this region? Look at the ice covering the streets and the buildings. It's very...I'm not sure how to put this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Peaceful. It seems like a truly lovely place. This calm and quiet is something that I wish our homeland shared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Nimul! Thank goodness you're all right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Emmel! You are unharmed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oooh, look at that, Adaleigh! Your girl is totally abandoning you for that guy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Uh, that's her brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Seriously? I had no idea siblings could get along so well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yeah, the two of us are always butting heads.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I mean, if Nyx was just a little more perceptive, maybe we'd get along better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And if only Mira could be a little more thoughtful, then maybe we wouldn't have so many problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Glad to see the two of you are having fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sorry, Adaleigh, we just can't help it! You should try to be less interesting when we poke fun at you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Plus, our teacher is always super supportive when we mess around like this. How could we resist?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ugh! Gimme a break...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So you two are Mira and Nyx?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yep! Who're you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I am called Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You saved Emmel and Adaleigh, correct? I am indebted to the both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Nah, bro! We were just doing what any friend would do. Saving their butts in their time of need!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We are delighted that we could help protect the people you hold dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Thank you, truly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I must ask...that power you possess, what is it exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huh? You mean Space-Time Manipulation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Space-Time...Manipulation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>How long are you children planning to mill around out here? Let's get going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Fine... Ambrosia, you're so impatient sometimes. You're gonna get wrinkles like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Uh, Mira? You shouldn't talk to Ambrosia about age—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Why would you bring that up?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yikes! Ambrosia, you make my hair stand on end when you yell like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>All right, I'll head back first and get some tea ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ugh... I don't know why I ever decided to bother with apprentices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Listen up, visitors from another world. Our home is down this street, beyond the hill and the grove.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Take your time and explore. Once your curiosity has been sated, you may find us there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I thank you for your kindness, but there is something we must do, and posthaste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We cannot really afford the leisure of sightseeing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ah, youth. Always in such a rush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>How exactly do you intend to get where you need to go? If I am not mistaken, you have yet to plan that far ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Don't waste your energy running in circles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Better to take a break, until panic and worry cease to be at the forefront of your mind. You can't do anything right now, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>This...really is a lovely place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>How interesting that you think so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Never mind. In any case, it's time for me to head back home and take a rest. It's been a while since I got wrapped up in kerfuffle like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Interesting? I wonder what she meant by that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Nimul, what should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ah. Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I want to return to the Sephira village as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>However, what that woman said is true. It will be no simple matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The ship is where we left it, and it still needs repairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>We should take this time to figure out a way to get around the Cursed Beast and repair the ship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It's likely that we will have to face the Cursed Beast again in order to accomplish our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>How are we going to do that? It all seems...impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Here, we have none of the Sephiron's protection. Without it, there's no way for us to make full use of our Spiritbonding abilities. And...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Even the Matter wasn't able to do anything to the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's...true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>We have no other cards to play. We have no choice but to try and figure something else out, and soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Like what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>In a settlement of this size, there must be a blacksmith, or somewhere with a forge of some kind. Perhaps I can borrow it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Oh! I wanna use it, too! I know which parts I need to repair the ship!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>If I could somehow get my hands on those, or make them, I should be all set when we get back to the ship!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I was just thinking something of the same. I believe that it is worth seeing what might be useful to us in this settlement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Besides, I think it might be good for me to take some time to collect my thoughts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>What was that last, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Er, nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>In that case, should we show you around?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Whoa! What?! How long have you been here?! Don't just jump out like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I thought the two of you had gone home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Uh, yeah? And now we're back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>We know this place better than the back of our hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>With Space-Time Manipulation, we can be wherever we want in a snap!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>All we need to do is mess with magil a little and we can play time and space like a fiddle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>We can avoid enemy attacks, and jump from one place to another...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>The manipulation of time and space?! What an incredible ability! I never imagined that there could be such a thing! This Belt Region is beyond all of my expectations...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Actually, we're still just apprentices, so messing with time's a little outside of our reach right now. And space? Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You'd be really surprised how limited this ability is. Everyone thinks it's super cool, but there are a lot of rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>There are only certain distances that can be traveled, and only a certain amount of weight that can be moved at once...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Nyx, why're you always so negative? Always focusing on the bad side of things!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>No, I just think that it's important to know your own limits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>So Space-Time Manipulation is a way of using magil in this Belt Region?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Uh...I guess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Mira! Come on, you know the answer to that. It's got nothing to do with this Belt Region. It's a technique unique to us! Or...I guess to Ambrosia. She's the one who came up with it, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Oh, right! Ambrosia invented it. Isn't that cool? I don't like to brag, but I am a little better at it than Nyx.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>And since this is a bit of an eccentric type of magic, we're...not so great at the so-called regular magics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>We're doing our best to learn them, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Is magic something that everyone is able to use here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I mean, not everyone, but, um... Yes, it's about that time... Oh, look at that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What? That person?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Just keep watching. Look! Did you see that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>They created fire...from thin air. It is nothing compared to what Spiritbonding can achieve, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>That person is a lamp lighter! Their job is to light the lamps when it starts to get dark, so that there'll still be light at night!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>We use magic to light fires in our stoves and hearths. We even use it for hunting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I see. In the Sephira village, we ascribe a certain divinity to our Spiritbonding, but the value of magic here lies in how it has been incorporated into your daily lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Wow! Has our humble little home piqued your interest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Let me tell you more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Ah, thank you, but I... Er...all right. Please, if you would let go of me, I can really walk on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>This way! There's more to see over here! Come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Looks like Mira's taken quite a liking to Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Maybe, but I think she's also just excited to show someone around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>We don't get many opportunities to do stuff like this. Mostly it's just Ambrosia getting mad at us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>She's really strict, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Like I said...lots of rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Space-Time Manipulation isn't magic that's easily controlled...and if it's not done right, the consequences can be dire and difficult to predict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Sounds dangerous. Ahem...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Hey! Don't run away! That's hurtful! You think I'm going to do something to you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Anyway, so...yeah. Ambrosia can be pretty strict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Plus, Mira's...well, Mira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Sometimes she just goes ahead and does what she wants, and then the both of us get punished. Ambrosia's not one to let us off lightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Nimul, I'll go with you! Wait for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Hm? Are you also interested in magic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Um...yes! Of course! Especially the way you talk about it. You really make it sound really very...interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Wow, okay! Come on, you two! Let's go! I leave the others to you, Nyx!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah... All right, you two. What did you say you're looking for again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>A forge, or any kind of large hearth where we can do some smithing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Ohh...right. Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Is there a problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Let's just go and take a look around. Adaleigh, are you—huh? Adaleigh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Uh, yeah? Huh? Emmel went with Mira and Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Adaleigh... You're really easy to read, you know that? You said that last part out loud, by the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Oops... I mean, hey! What're you trying to say? I can be—I mean, I am mysterious! Cool and mysterious, a man among men!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah. If you say so. Shall we go on then, Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Yes. The sooner, the better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Huh? Where are you...? Hey, don't just ignore me and leave me behind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Where is everyone? I seem to have missed them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I suppose it's not really necessary for me guard Nimul and the others in a place like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>If Julia were here, I could simply leave that task to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Oh, a visitor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>How unexpected! We don't get many visitors. Which settlement do you hail from? Are you here on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>What brings you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Oh, I, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>(What should I say?! If I tell them I'm from another Belt Region, would they even believe me? I didn't expect to have to explain my presence here...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>You've so many questions for our guest! Don't you see you're making him uncomfortable? What kind of welcome is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Besides, there's really only one reason young people come around these parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I suppose you're right. I'm truly sorry about that, Stranger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>N-no, it's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>(What a relief. At least I don't have to explain myself now.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Apologies for interrupting your search. I hope you find a good partner for yourself soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>We'll be rooting for you! You never know when your love story is going to unfold! The perfect person might be waiting just around the corner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>What a lovely gentleman you are! Where is your better half?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>You must've just got here. Were there any available women left in town? You know, I'm not sure...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Oh no, we can't have this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>What're you gentlemen all huddling together for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>A crowd of men like this is way too intimidating for a young woman to approach alone! This is all wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>What? We're just⁠—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Ahh, perhaps you don't know much about attraction? That's just no good, my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>There must be someone around here who piques your interest. Don't be shy! Just go ahead and talk to them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Love is great! It can change your entire life! It's so wonderful, I want everyone to know how it feels!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Ah... Right. I'd forgotten that this region was like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>They're friendly, but, uh...a bit preoccupied with love, you could say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Which reminds me, Nyx! You didn't say anything about this at all! What's with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Nyx...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Huh? You done talking? Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Uh...okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>How should I put this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>If I were to describe this place in a few words, they would be "overflowing with love."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>That's a really pretty way to put it, Mister Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Do you disagree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>I dunno. I mean, what really is love? I wouldn't know the first thing about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>You don't have a crush on anyone, Mira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Nah... I mean, there's no one here for me, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>That can't be true. I don't believe that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Ooohh, what about you, Emmel? Have you ever been, you know, in love?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Um, well...no. I guess I haven't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Then we're the same!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Perhaps, but...I do have an idea of what love might be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>What? Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>After witnessing it from up close for so long...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Oooh! Sounds juicy. Tell me more! Tell me everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>U-um...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>It's, um...it's a secret! I made a promise to never tell anyone about it, ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>You promised? Aw, man. Well, I guess it is what it is. I'm so curious, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Anyway, on with the tour! So, the origins of this fountain are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Such beauty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>M-Miss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>O-oh? Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Yes, Miss! You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>My name is Winnick. I apologize for approaching you so abruptly—I simply had to speak to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>O-oh, okay. How can I help you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Um...so...well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>I-I have fallen in love with you! It was love at first sight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Please, would you do me the honor of becoming my better half?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>That's very...direct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>I-I... Thank you, but I am not interested. I don't even know you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>I know we've just met. I don't blame you for thinking that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>I completely understand that you might be suspicious because we don't know anything about each other. I might have come on a little strong, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>I am completely and utterly captivated by you! Please, just give me a chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>B-but I don't... Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>Er, I'd rather stay out of it. It's up to you to decide how you want to respond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Yes, but...! This is just so sudden!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Are you really okay with this, Mister Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>As her brother, I feel a little conflicted, but...it's her life. She has to make her own decisions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>My duty is simply to watch carefully and ensure that, whoever she chooses, they treat her right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>That's a little unexpected. You said you were...Sephirans, was it? Your people are way more open-minded than I thought!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>Open-minded? What do you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>I-in any case, this really isn't the time! I'm sorry, but I cannot return your feelings. Please leave me alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Oh... All right. I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>I apologize for troubling you. Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>Are you sure, Emmel? He was quite the looker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>What? What are you saying, Nimul? If I'd really decided to go with him, surely you would have stopped me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>I'm not sure. I would have needed to see what kind of man he really was first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>To be frank, I am altogether unfamiliar with this area...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>But I must say, he had quite some nerve to approach my little sister and ask to spend time with her! A stranger! It is not such a simple thing to become a part of this family, let me tell you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>I told you! You're so overprotective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>I am well aware!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Anyway, this is no time for such things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>Our priority is to return to the Sephira village as soon as possible! Is that not so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>Right. Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>Hah! You two are so interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>Have you seen enough of our little town, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>Yes. Thank you for the tour.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>I would like to discuss our next move with everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>I believe we need only follow this road to get to the witch's abode?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>Yep, yep! Ambrosia's house is straight down this road and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>Eek...ekk...keke...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>What is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>An insect? I've never seen something like this before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>Ah. Well, we've gotten kinda close to the outskirts of town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>Ekk! Ekk! Keke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>Get ready, you two! We're gonna bust our way through to Ambrosia's!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>Just do me a favor, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>These guys are just a little excited, so be gentle. They don't mean anything by it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>Oh, um...okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240</td>
<td>Here they come!</td>
</tr>
