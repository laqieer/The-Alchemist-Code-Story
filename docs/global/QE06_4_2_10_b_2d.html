<td>Come on, Logi! Hurry up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ah! Edgar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Heh. Sorry. Didn't mean to lose my cool with this jerk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Look at that Tamba guy's face. His expression seems so...pained. It's almost like he's begging someone to save him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I see what you mean. But that doesn't change the part where he's our enemy right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah. I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>For all your big talk about killing us, you seem to struggle with getting the job done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'll kill you all in one fell blow! Just get back here, and you'll see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Haaaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Why are you so eager to die? Humanity is doomed to perish as it is. Do you just want to join them early and get it over with?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>As long as we're still around, humanity still has a chance. Nothing is inevitable. No future is set in stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I simply cannot understand your stubbornness! Just give me the sword, and I'll walk away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I told you, that's not happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You just don't know when to quit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Heh, quitting isn't part of my vocabulary. We of the Blade Fox always fight till the bitter end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And don't you go forgetting about me, either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You don't even belong here! Why are you throwing your life away for this foreign land?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's like I said: I fight for my friends. And for myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Besides, I'm already plenty involved here! I'd rather die than abandon Wadatsumi now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Fine. Then die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Argh! Hng!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Protect us, Anastasia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Over time, I've come to learn of my roots, and those who watch over me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And I don't intend to let even a single person here die until Logi gets his chance to learn the same! Until Logi finds his own destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Because while he's busy introspecting, I'm here to act in his stead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I've never seen such a technique. This could complicate matters. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It won't be a problem if I kill you first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Agatha! Run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Uggrraaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Logi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ngh....This technique! It can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Sorry for the wait, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Was that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes, that was one of Wadatsumi's Sacred Three. That was the sacred art of Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It's time we strike back!</td>
