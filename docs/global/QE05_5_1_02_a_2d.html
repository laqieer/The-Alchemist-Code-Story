<td>Report!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Sir! Inspection of the stronghold is complete! The facilities have sustained minimal damage, but the sentries stationed there were nearly all wiped out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The Jam... Swords and spears were almost entirely ineffective. It was a miracle you were able to protect the king through all of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Give the surviving troops plenty of time to rest. Those who perished... What happened to their bodies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They...do not look good, sir. We can barely discern the names of those whose bodies are...still identifiable as such.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I see. Regardless, hold whatever service possible for those souls. Their sacrifice has led to our survival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Adelbert, I'm sorry to bother you, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Logi. I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Though our mission here has failed, it's not over yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We must strike down Ceclidis for the sake of those we have lost this day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What forces do we have left?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We lost almost a quarter of our troops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Had you not urged us to retreat from the capital, we would have lost so many more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We can still fight, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We will have to figure out some means of dealing with all of the Jam, if we are to win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Right. The way the capital looks, I would wager that the old king keeps a host of those monsters beside him at all times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We cannot win unless we rid ourselves of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This is why the Liberation Army sought the aid of the Sephira, of Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I just never expected there to be so many of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Kamui... I hope he's all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Finally. They're gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It doesn't seem like the Jam have sharp senses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Still, I expect any bit of Spiritbonding would bring a horde of them upon me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I can only execute proper Spiritbonding a few more times. I hope I can make it out of the capital by then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Otherwise I'll be needing to secure a place to rest. I highly doubt that would be possible here, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hic... Hic...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Is that...a child's voice? Could there be a child here in this city still?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Grrrrraaaarrrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ah! N-no! Go away! Go away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...!</td>
