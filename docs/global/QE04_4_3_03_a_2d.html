<td>Are you deaf? I told you. It's my turn next, unless you want to see Saga reduced to a smoldering wasteland!</td>

<td>Fuu!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Nothing will change if we stand here twiddling our thumbs. So, shouldn't we take one step forward? The question is, how do I get up there...?</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I think I might be able to help you with that.</td>

<td>Lisbeth?</td>

<td>Tina, I'm really glad I met you. Everyone else from Saga, too. I want to help you in any way I can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't say that! What...are you planning?! It's like... It's like you're about to say goodbye!</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm not going anywhere! I just don't have any time to explain. I have to push my body to the limit to ensure this works!</td>

<td>Tina, don't look so worried! Next time we see each other, it'll be smiles all around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You've got a lovely smile, you know! That's why I'm going to do everything in my power to make you...and everyone else in Saga...smile again!</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Very well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If everyone will hear me out, please... I think I have an idea. I might be able to get you to the dragon's back again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Lisbeth...what exactly are you planning to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Could you all lend me some of your wind power? Voda, if you would grant me some of your water as well... I'll stop the dragon in its tracks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>All right, Lisbeth! Here we go!</td>

<tr>

<td>Lisbeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>She's fine. She's just lost consciousness from using all of her magical energy. What a reckless girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Climbing that monstrosity won't be easy, even with one of its legs frozen. I've given it much thought.</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We can't waste this opening Lisbeth has given us. I'm going in alone!</td>
