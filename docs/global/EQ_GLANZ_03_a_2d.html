<td>001</td>
<td>This concludes my report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It seems this noble in question had been raiding several ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And yet he had far fewer Philosopher's Stones than we expected in his possession.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If I remember correctly, it was the chief of the Unicorn Knights that delivered the stolen artifacts, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It was. He sent the carriage. Are you suspicious of him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I heard a little rumor that you grew quite close to those thieving little girls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Something about promising to give them some lessons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I...haven't formally accepted anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You should. And if you don't mind, accept another mission for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hello, Glanz. Such hostility in the air, isn't there? The castle guards...and Neville...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I noticed. I suppose it would be wise for an outsider like me to get out of here quick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Glanz... Is there any chance of you reconsidering my proposition?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If it's about me becoming one of the knights, I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I understand... I just wanted to try my luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>War is coming, and I wanted to have someone I could trust beside me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I just wished that could be you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>To be honest, I would like that. I did not hate fighting alongside you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>And yet I assume you found a reason to continue to do otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Just remember. You shouldn't say things like that to someone you've turned down twice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh no. I almost forgot Neville is expecting me. I will see you again, Glanz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Say, is Freed back from his mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>He died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh... I had hoped he could tell me more about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What is that? A key?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I do not know either. Anastasia... Do you think Freed found his own reason to rush through life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Who knows? But would he have been saved if he had?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>There is no deliverance. You know that, Anastasia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's enough for now. Let's take a break.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What?! No! I can still fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Don't overdo it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm not! I need to get stronger so I can protect my family, the Unicorn Knights!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I can't have the Chief protecting me all the time! That's just not right! I have to be stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Besides, I can't make Rochelle take care of all the fighting! That's not right either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>All I'm saying is any further exertion is counterproductive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Haphazard training won't make you any stronger. When it comes to training, it's quality over quantity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Urrgh! But still...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I know... I understand how you feel. I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Glizzy likes earnest little ones like you, because she is sparkly-shiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Did you call me little again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Just know that overexertion is never good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>All right, fine! We're done for today! I'll go get the bath ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Training over. I'm going to sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You didn't even do the training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>G'night...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Okay, I guess I'm the pillow again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I wonder... How long has it been since I saw someone sleep so soundly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I can't remember what my little sister looked like asleep. I was always out on a job while she slept.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>She would always be awake by the time I got home. Smiling and waiting for my return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'm fine, don't worry. I believed those words. I had to believe those words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That's why I never knew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry! I'm so—Cough! Cough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Aah, shut it! You coughin' like that's makin' me sick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Don't you know how miserable I already am?! How pathetic it is that I can't fight for my country?! Dammit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Wha—?! What are you doing?! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I never knew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Rina was fighting her own battles while I was out dirtying my hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I didn't know, and yet I felt like I was the one protecting her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>We're family. Of course I'll protect you. It's just what I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Some soldiers are forced into retirement after being wounded in battle. Our father, for example...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>His deep feelings of patriotism turned into resentful obsession... And I stained my hands red with his blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>This world is filled with such cruel turns of fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>This world truly is a stifling place, isn't it, Freed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Huff... Okay! Bath done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>No, you are not! You just got in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Why not? I'm clean now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Why, she says...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Oh, don't even try. She really hates bathing. Even Helza telling her how important it is to warm the body properly couldn't change her mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Baths are boring. Not fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Fine... But look at this. I've got this ball, see? I'm just going to drop it into the bath...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Wha—?! It's actually...sparkly-shiny! Whoooooa... It smells good too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Cool! What is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>And then if you do this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Wah! You shot water from your hands! So, like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>H-hey! Cut that out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Geez... I didn't expect you to have so many bath items on you, Glanz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Yeah... Well, my little sister didn't really care for taking baths either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>So to make sure she took proper baths, I tried all sorts of things and... Well, I got into it myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Oh, you have a little sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Had. She's had health issues for a long time and passed away a few years ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>S-sorry... I didn't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>It's fine. Anyway, I didn't think I'd get to take a decent bath around here. This is nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Glizzy likes baths?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I do. No matter how dirty you get, a bath washes you clean. I really don't like being dirty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>This hot spring was Helza's favorite. Chief said that's why we have our hideout here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Sounds like something she would do. She did love her baths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Rochelle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I'm overheating. I'm getting out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Overheating? You haven't been in for that long, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Wait, Rochelle! You have to dry your hair! You're gonna catch a cold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Wha—?! Did you see that?! Someone was there! A peeper?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>(Was that...Rochelle?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Ishuna, you go back to where everyone else is. I'll go check it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Good work. Here's your pay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Is this it?! This isn't what we agreed on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>We got rid of that minx on your behalf, didn't we? We just took our cut from this. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Well, that's...true...but still!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>(Got rid of that minx...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>We like you a lot better than the last chief. You're much easier to get along with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>As long as you keep bringing us information we want, we'll have something for you in return. You work for Envylia now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Rochelle? Wh-what are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I hate icky-stickies. But Izzy... She believes in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I'm a black and white bear that can't be with people. Helza still believed in me. And you killed her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>What is this?! Who is she?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I fight for those who believe in me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>So... I'm going to pummel you all.</td>
