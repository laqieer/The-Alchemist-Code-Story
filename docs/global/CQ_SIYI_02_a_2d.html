<td>H-Holy cow! He's just tearing through monsters. He has such amazing strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(I think I've heard of Gormalas before... Shenmei mentioned he's the Black Keels'...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(What should I do? If he knows I'm a friend of Shenmei's...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If you value your life, hunker down there and put your hands over your head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hurry or you're dead. Your head will be rolling along the ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Geh, I take what I want from whoever I want. I'll take it from you before you take it from me. That's the way of pirates!</td>
</tr>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Heh... You wanna die here? ...Hey! What are you doing in a place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Eep...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oops...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You're so pale and small... Are you frail, as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Blegh... I thought you'd be a fine replacement for the treasure, but such a brittle child... You're of no value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(My body isn't weak anymore... My medicine has cured my seizures, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Captain, don't be so blunt! You'll make the kid cry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You think so? You got something you wanna say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>N-No! That's not what I meant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm so sick of being lost in this dank cave. All this walking is infuriating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We've been wandering around this bizarre terrain. And that map you brought is useless! No one could make sense of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There was never any hope of bringing back this phantom treasure! We were tricked by false dreams!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah, hell...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Eh? What's that you got? Hand it over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What?! That's no good, girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ah, but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Eh? This is just some map. It's barely even legible. ...Wait! Is this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>W-Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hey, is this map just something you drew?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh, y-yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It actually looks pretty good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I never forget a path I've walked, so I can say for certain this is a good and accurate map.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oh, Miss, that's amazing! If the captain says so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh, um, w-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Is he... praising me?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But what is this bit here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well, that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You wouldn't need a map like this unless you were looking for the treasure... Are you doing the same as us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I, uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>A little weakling like you wouldn't happen to be a pirate, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(You're wrong. I'm not some weak kid. I'm a pirate. And it's as a pirate I've explored this cave...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(That's what I want to say, but... I'm too scared to say it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(I'm sure Shenmei would be able to stand up to him, and Liu Shen would...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(I guess I'm not strong enough to be a pirate like you two.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, I don't care who or what you are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm taking this map.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>A little fledgling like you wouldn't have much use for a map like this, but I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Pl-Please... That's my...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It's mine now. For this map, I'll kindly ignore you going away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>B-But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That's very kind for the captain. You should be glad you could give him the map.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Don't say anything rude, and get out of here before you offend the captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>But that map...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(That map... I made it to share in the adventure with everyone else.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Remember, this is the way of the world, kid. The weak get robbed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Freedom is the right of the strong. The weak can't do what they want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Can't do what they want...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>That's not true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Su Yi can go wherever she wants! She makes brilliant maps!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>If she's ill, then she can get well! I'll be sure to bring her the medicine she needs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>And when she's well, we'll go on real adventures! She'll be a fearless pirate forging her own legendary stories!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>With Su Yi's maps, we can go anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>(Shenmei always praised my maps, and said I could go wherever I wanted.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>(She promised me that with my maps we could go on adventures anywhere together.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>(When my illness immobilized me, and I drew a map from what I could read about, Liu Shen praised me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>(That made me so happy, so I studied and worked on my map more and more. And now, it's being stolen from me...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Remember this. Weak little kids getting taken from is the way of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Freedom is the special right of the strong. The weak don't get to do what they want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>(The weak can't do what they want...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>(I can't...take this anymore!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>W-Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>G-Give me back that map! I'm not giving it to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I made that map especially for my family, the crew of the Xiao Shenmei, so you can't have it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Xiao Shenmei?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You're friends with that cheeky spitfire?! You're a pirate?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hmph. I can tell you're like that impertinent little brat enough to be from her crew, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Do you know what it means to say to me that you're a pirate like I am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>(He's pretty scary, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I'm not just some pathetic kid. I'm going to go on all sorts of adventures to all sorts of places with everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I can go wherever and do whatever I want. So be quiet and give me my map! I won't accept anything else!</td>
