<td>This area is...a shrine?! Could it be Mammon's?!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>.........</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I see. Luke... You took on all of Benika's corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>At this rate, this region will be swallowed up by corruption, just as with Guardian Dragon Nidhogg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No... Luke...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Scraaarghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Fall back, Roh Ku.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Grrooooooooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Troops, ready your swords! The enemy is a dragon Fallen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>A worthy adversary for us to face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Kubera!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We will draw its attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You said you did not want it killed. If that determination is unchanged, reveal it to me once more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Grrrraaaarrrrgggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What should we do now, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That dragon hasn't succumbed fully yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If we can drive the purification Alchemy into its head...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That large Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes. If only we had the airship with us now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We finally caught up to you, my foolish apprentices!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That voice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Could it be Ambrosia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?! This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Heh, looks like we made it in the nick of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Are Mira and Nyx not here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Abstinent Witch Ambrosia! And...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hey there, friends. Looks like you're in a bind. I'll give you a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm so glad you're safe, Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Minario! And Waginau! How did you all get here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This guy let us know that you were in trouble. And there was no way we were not going to come and help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Honestly... Now is not the time for bantering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So you would like to do something about the dragonkin before us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Exactly! Minario, can you fly us over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>'Course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>We fixed up the airship you left in the Invidia Belt perfectly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>With this level of quality, it'll only take one jump to get there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Are you ready, Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, yes... But what do you intend to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>There are no Gears of Judgement nor is there anyone who could wield it. So what are we going to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>There is still an area we haven't tried yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Let's go, Minario!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Aye, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Nnngg... Haaah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>There's not enough time to apply the brakes! We'll cross for a split second! Jump on at the right moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Let's go, Yna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Three, two, one...now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes, we made it on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Sorry, but this is as far as it goes! From here on out, you'll have to run up the back of that huge snake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I don't know why but there's no Libra on this ship!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's impossible to provide adequate backup without Libra at this distance! But we'll have to do what we can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You've done enough! Let's go, Yna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What?! The dragon is moving?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>This is the dragon technique I wield! I will become a blade to cut through corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Isn't that Zafeiris's technique?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I will explain later! Focus on the problem before us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>R-right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Grrrraaaaahhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Here it comes, Nimul! With that much mass, a direct hit from it would be...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Urk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Nimul?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'm...all right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I see your anger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>(That voice from before... Add that to what Bianca said, and...!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>But if you defeat them, obtain them, and follow them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Your wish is sure to come true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>If those words were true...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>"I will transcend envy and become wrath!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>"My faith will be guided by two stones."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I am still a far cry from the Truth. There are things I cannot save and even if I stretch out my hand, I don't know what I will gain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>But even so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I hereby swear it again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I need it! I need greater power! I will break this spiral of sorrow! I must have it to lead all of humankind to a golden era!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I must open the door to the beyond and reveal it here and now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>This is my ideal future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Access to the Invidia Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Access to the Ire Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>We will become stones and submit to your will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What is this light?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I have never seen anything like this in my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Oh, the light of my princess! The light of all things, illuminating the world of creation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Silence! Cease attempting to come to the forefront! You're disrupting my control!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>"The Power of Alchemy is not solely for creating wealth!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>"In other words, my soul will become a new, refined extreme!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast's core is now under control. With this much magil, we can dispel the dragon's body again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Ssscccaaaaarrrrgghhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Dragon child swallowed by corruption, I will now break this spell!</td>
