<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Heh. That's the last of them. They won't be following us anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What in the name of the gods are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is the mansion of the leader of the Shiba Senko! I'm sure I told you that we should remain hidden and watch their movements first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Instead, you have just strolled into the heart of their mansion like you own the place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Did I? Oh! Ha. So I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I have no intention of getting in your way. I just want to know what you're thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Well, defenses are like an apple tree. If you shake the trunk, things start to come loose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Come loose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Like, for example, the location of Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Look at all this fuss. They're freaking out, but there are areas they're not willing to abandon yet. That's a clear sign there's something important that needs extra protection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I mean, it didn't work this time, but the logic is solid. Am I right, or am I right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I know that whole thing with your sister makes you a little antsy. With the doom and the imminent murder and whatever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But like I said, I've got your back, man! Leave the thinking to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You're not exactly—er, I don't mean to criticize, but—the most...ninja...of ninja, if you catch my meaning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You're not in any position to point fingers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well! Anyway, did you feel that energy before?! That must be the Carn...Incarn...Discarn... The Discarnate Power! Yeah! Got it right that time. Whew, that feels good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes. Yomi's power has grown quite a lot. Tch, "Demon Calming Ceremony."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What they are really doing is increasing her power by pouring Chakra into it. The corruption inside of her is expanding rapidly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>When I came across her the other day, it was clear that the corruption was uncontrolled and eating away at her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>There's no mistake... The Shiba Senko and that old codger from the Kagomurasaki are plotting to force her power to manifest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>At this rate, Yomi will be—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You know, you're not what I pictured at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>When I found out you were a monster who killed his entire family, I kind of expected more—I don't know—psychotic muttering or something. Maybe some gross facial hair...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You've got none of that. You've even resigned yourself to being killed by your little sister. I can't deny that monsters come in all forms, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>None of that matters. All you need to do is lend me your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Well, since I'm lending you my strength, the least you can do is tell me about what happened. I'm guessing there is some kind of backstory behind this whole thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It has nothing to do with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Psh... Monster...? More like conversation killer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'll have you know, it's very childish to shut me down just because I wanna know a little more about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Can't you move on? Do you have to kill him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>In Wadatsumi, killing one's own family is considered one of the gravest sins. It's a disgrace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>My clan and I were utterly humiliated after the incident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That's why I must kill him, or else neither myself nor the members of my clan can move on. The past must be settled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You have your burdens as head of your clan, and I have mine as Greed Dike's General.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That said... I don't mean to speak out of turn, but it seems to me like you're trying to find a way to move on without killing your brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wha—?! Of course not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I don't know how much my words are worth, coming from the General of a country who once invaded your own, but I'll tell you this:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You can't move on if you're stuck in the past. Sometimes you just have to push through the humiliation in order to move forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I don't know anything about the path you're headed down, but...I think it'd be nice if our paths joined at some point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Maybe then we could, um, maybe—ahem—be f-friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Well, um, I apologize if the notion offends you. It's just that...because I've been in the army since I was young, I haven't really had the chance to make many friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ah, but I'm not young anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I know. It's just your face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We're close in age, and our responsibilities are similar, so I only thought... Never mind. Just forget about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>When the day comes that I overcome my past, perhaps it is possible that we could become friends. I think...that I'd like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I...! I would, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Well then, I suppose I had better start coming up with a plan to renegotiate with the Shiba Senko.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You know, so that we can join forces one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What about Sumeragi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That sword exists to clear your path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I will search for a way for us to understand each other, one that doesn't involve swords, armies, or clans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Leafah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That's the first time you've used my name, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Leafah, you're a very impressive grown-up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>W-well, yeah! It's just my baby face that's misleading!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Heheh, right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Let's meet again, Yomi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>See you around, Leafah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Overcoming my past, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>In order to do that, I need to meet my brother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Meet my brother and...and...and then...! W-wait, what am I going to do then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That's when I'll...I'll...I-I'll...! I will—aaaaaarrrrrrrrgggggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That's right, I'm going to kill him! I'm going to get revenge for my family! Yes, yes, I must kill him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hate... Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate! Ngh... What's wrong with me? Why do I feel...so much...hate?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Ngh! Aaaaaarrrrgggghhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Heheh. It shouldn't be long now. The Discarnate Power will manifest shortly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>The amplifying effect of the Mikaboshi truly is remarkable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>It may not have the power it once possessed, but it remains the equal of even the Sacred Stones. Yes... We will keep her hatred seething!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power will manifest any moment now! When it does, a new Wadatsumi will be born! With its first breath, it will swallow the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Okay, how about a guessing game? Sooo, I'm thinking... Maybe the previous head of the Kagomurasaki Clan was disappointed that the next in line was a girl, your little sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Just kidding, that's actually a rumor that made it even as far as the Black Star Clan, but if it's true, Jin, then what you did—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Don't say another word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>This is super sad. Have you thought about what it's like for Yomi, who has to hate you without even knowing the reason why you did what you did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Have you ever considered how it must feel for her to inherit the Discarnate Power with the weight of all that on her shoulders?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I told you not to say another word!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I can't...talk about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Please, don't ask me about it anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>All right. I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Why what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Why get involved with me? You should stay away. Nothing good will come of this for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You'll just get hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>If you have a duty to carry out, and our goal is the same, I will join forces with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Just don't try and get close to me. Why are you trying to pry into my past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Dunno. Curiosity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>C-curiosity?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Well, I was always taught that ninjas are bound by things like fate, rules, tradition, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>You know, all that righteous twaddle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>But here you are, breaking away from all of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Even though it would be far easier if you were to just follow the code, protect tradition, and explain things away as being part of the rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I guess you could say that I'm...envious. It's not like I'm here because I want to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>That's why I'm curious about you. How did you do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I've been asked that before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>It's not like I'm doing something impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I just keep running away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>It's truly disgraceful. Feel free to ridicule me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I'm sensing something. This energy...! It's that Discarnate Power! Is it really so strong that we can feel it all the way out here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Seems like it's fading now, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>There's no time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>So it seems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Let's head back to the Shiba Senko mansion. There's not much time left. I'm going to get Yomi out of there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I guess I'll focus on finding Sumeragi. For the demon expungement, and all that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>But what are you planning to do after you get Yomi out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>After...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>If you don't tell her the truth, Yomi will continue to blame you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>If it comes to that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I'd rather keep running away.</td>
</tr>
