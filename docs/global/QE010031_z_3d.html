<td>001</td>
<td>Agatha chose to leave with the Lizard Brigade?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. What does she think she's doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I was too weak. I thought I had gained the power to protect what was important to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And yet, I was unable to protect my own sister—the one thing I had to protect over everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>A knight's true value is tested by what he does when faced with a difficult situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If you want to bask in regret, then you should do it after you rescue Agatha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yeah, Logi. If you have time to mope over what happened, then start thinking of a way to save Agatha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>For my part, I'm going to master the laws of Alchemy as soon as I can and use that power to save Agatha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>True. A knight needs the power to save others and protect the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>However, more importantly, what matters is how he uses that power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Dias, this is something you must learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I must learn how to use my powers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You must focus on controlling the power of your Alchemy—a power that exceeds human limits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It appears you've all gathered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Due to the expanding revolt of old Wratharis against our kingdom...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It has been decided that the Holy Guard, serving under the Holy Order of Babel, will officially step in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The Holy Guard? The strongest army force in all of the continent? I thought they were wary of intervening in the warfare of any one kingdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The Lizard Brigade's use of Alchemy is the reason behind this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This decision was reached in a meeting held between the Six Elders, who are composed of the grand councilors from each kingdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It was a decision declared under the name of His Holiness Pope Aimerlin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>And you, Gabirond, as one of the Six Elders, will be unifying the Paladins that have been dispatched?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...Do not worry. I'll be keeping a sharp eye on them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We don't want the Holy Guard intervening in our kingdom's internal affairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Zeke. Lead the Blue Flame Guard and work together with the Holy Guard to stop Sabareta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Understood. However, I have one request. I would like Dias to join the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What? On what basis do you request this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Dias is a knight who will be responsible for the future of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I wish for him to learn how the Holy Guard, the ultimate military force in all the continent, handles Alchemy. Please, grant my request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It will be more efficient if us two brothers, who have fought Sabareta, search for him separately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The search for Agatha is more urgent than anything. Lord Gabirond, I humbly ask you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Dias...</td>
