<td>What are you doing here?</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Whoa, geez! Oh, it's you, Captain Tanosuke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You know it's part of your job to rest when you can, right? I mean, I was just about to go take a nap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I-I know, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I told you, thinking really isn't one of your strong suits. Don't force yourself to do it too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Rude! How many times do I have to hear that?! I mean...it's true, but—</td>

<td>Celis makes the best meals, doesn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What? That was an abrupt change of subject.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I just thought it was really good. There's something special about sitting at a table with friends you've fought alongside against certain death. Not to mention the nap afterwards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>D-did you eat something funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Harsh... Look, all I'm saying is that it doesn't help to overthink things. To overcomplicate matters—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's a very bad habit we humans have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That is...probably true, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Just take good care of what you have in front of you, because that is what you spend your time building.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I... I just can't avoid thinking about the voice and visions that cut into my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There's no point in dwelling on things you just don't know anything about. You are you, I am me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Keep that in mind, or you'll lose sight of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke, you too... The voice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>My name is the Tanosuke, Third Squad Captain of the Blade Fox Corps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I... I am Amane, a member of the Third Squad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Isn't that enough? Even if that isn't all that you are, that's still you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's...so right! Thank you, sir. You always know exactly what to say, Captain Tanosuke. Your words are a boon to my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Just your heart, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Wha—?! Wh-what do you think you're looking at?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Not much, honestly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I-I just need a few more years and...and then I'll have—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Just get back to the barracks. You need to rest so you'll be ready when we need your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>All right. Fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Wha—?! An emergency?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke, let's go!</td>
