<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Phew, we made it! I never thought we'd be attacked by so many bandits!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Thanks for everything back there, Miss Carla!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You sure are strong. Those guys didn't stand a chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well, I grew up in these parts, so I'm pretty used to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>In your case, I wouldn't underestimate the desert if I were you, kid. It's pretty dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I know you've got to make a living, but at least get yourself a chaperone, kid…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Believe me, I take this place seriously. Us merchants are pretty light on our feet, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Besides, I'm not a kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Actually, we might be closer in age than you think. I've got several years under my belt…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You don't say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Here, take a look at my wares. You think a kid could nab all these?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Lately, I've had a lot of weapons sales.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>See, what do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hm. Not bad! They're all high quality! Not to mention--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, I'll be! Don't see goods like that 'round here. How much are you selling that for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This? I think I could let it go for about this much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Deal! Never thought I'd get my hands on one of these babies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Impressive! With wares like these, I'm sure you'll sell out in no time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>*Chuckle* Traveling the world gives me an edge over the competition!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If I catch wind of a popular item, I'll book it to that region and judge for myself if it's worthwhile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh yeah? That's good news for you, but I bet the guilds are none too happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'm sure it's fine. I rarely make it out here to the desert, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh? Is that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Besides, the guilds have all the power around here. I don't have much of a leg to stand on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If you include travel expenses and the like, I can barely turn a profit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yikes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wait a sec. Then why did you come all the way out here, kid?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Why bother if you can't even make money?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Actually, I came here to deliver a special order to a customer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>During his travels, this customer discovered a delicious tea made in a settlement in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But the guild doesn't do business with the settlement, so I stocked up and came here to sell it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You went to all that trouble for one customer? You sure are nice, kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Nice? Nah… Sure, I like to put a smile on my customers' face, but that's not all there is to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It might seem like a lot of work to please one customer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But I think I'll benefit in the long run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hey, you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You can't set up shop here without the guild's permission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh? You've got the wrong idea. I'm just showing my wares to a friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We saw you conducting business with a customer just a minute ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Well, that was…actually…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I suggest you educate yourself and abide by the guild's rules if you want to do business here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Tell you what--you sell us your wares wholesale, and we forget this ever happened. Capiche?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What's your problem? You think you can talk to him like that because he's an outsider?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Butt out, missy. Besides, I think it's a reasonable offer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Tch. Seems that jerk is intent on buying from you. What'll you do, Aruba?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Um, thanks...but no thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>How come? Weren't you just saying how hard it was to turn a profit out here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That's true--at least, for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Then why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>A merchant needs to be patient, Miss Carla.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Live in the desert long enough and you become impatient--your heart starts to dry up…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>For me, watering this seed is like praying to return some life to the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(This kid has the same determined look in his eyes. Just like Hawk…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Damn… if we go easy on him now, he'll get cocky…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Don't think outsiders like you can do business here. We'll drive you out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Alright, boys. Take care of him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Aieeeee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Wait a damn minute! This isn't right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Shut up! We pay our dues to the guild in order to do business here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>We're not going to be disrespected by some outsider!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I thought it was your tone that I disliked, but it's this whole corrupt system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I bet you were hoping to make money off of Aruba's wares, weren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Shut your mouth unless you want to wind up like him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Resorting to violence to settle this, huh? Pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Aruba is just trying to make an honest living…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It's thanks to people like you the desert is in this sad state!</td>
</tr>
