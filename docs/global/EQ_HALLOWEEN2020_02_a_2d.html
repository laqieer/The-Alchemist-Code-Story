<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>So you really just missed? Huh. With a throw like that, I figured you had it in for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I fear my fiery passions ran away with me. You have my humblest apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm really sorry too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's all good. Just be more careful next time, eh? I gotta tell you, this smarts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>So this is how they settle arguments at this Halloween Carnival? It's a little weird, but it's better than fighting it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Grr... Such humiliation! That the Successor of the Sun should have to bow his head to anyone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>For all that, you seemed pretty apologetic back there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>For the fault was all mine. Sometimes, even the Successor of the Sun must admit his mistakes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You know, at first I thought you were totally full of yourself, but you've got your priorities right where it counts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Plus you're really trying to cheer Julia up. Maybe you aren't so bad after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmph! This is the least of what the Successor of the Sun should be expected to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Unfortunately, our fluffy prize has slipped through our fingers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, you win some, you lose some. We'll just have to think of something else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ramses! Blanchett!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I come to investigate a disturbance, and what do I find but you two! Just what has been going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>A teddy bear? For me? Well, at least your hearts were in the right place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Good grief. Do you have any idea how worried I was when I realized you were gone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>My apologies. Distressing you was not my intention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We only kept it quiet because we wanted it to be a surprise. I'm sorry it ended up like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. It was a kind thing to try to bring a 'pleasant surprise' to me. Very befitting of the theme of the carnival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, right! Ahaha, you got us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>My training must be lacking if you could have given me the slip so easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Anyway, it seems I've given you the wrong idea. I wasn't staring at that teddy bear because I wanted it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It just happened to catch my attention, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Such things aren't meant for people like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh? What's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It doesn't matter. What's important is that I've finished baking. Would you care to taste-test?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Fresh-made sweets?! I'm there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Of... Of course. It would be my pleasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hrmm... Something about Julia's smile sets me ill at ease.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It reminds me a little too much of a certain someone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Julia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Whoa, there's LOADS! Just how many did you make?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Let's see here... Mmm, these are splendid! This homely, yet refined sweetness satisfies even my royal tongue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm happy to hear that. I didn't know how many we might need, so I made as many as time and ingredients allowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If that's enough, I should join the others on guard patrol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm still worried about her, you know. I get the feeling she really struggles to put herself first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Like, if she really didn't care about that bear, then why was she staring at it so hard? It's like she's always trying to hide how she really feels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>She made me really happy when she complimented my cutouts. If she's feeling lonely, I have to do something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I want to make sure she has a happy Halloween too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I agree. So long as I am here, my responsibility as Successor of the Sun is to make sure even Julia has a wonderful time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Moreover, a part of me cannot stand to see the sadness in her eyes. What we need...is a plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Trick or treat! Give us our candy or you'll get pranked!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Bwah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Do not leap at me so, little ones! We will apportion you your treats shortly, but not now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh? You mean you're out of candy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Then you know what comes next! Rosa, prank them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Now, now, children, not so hasty. I expect the same composure from you as from any other servants of the red and black.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hey, Rosa, what gives?! Who are these kids, and why are they so dead-set on pranking us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hehe, a fine question. To show I've mended my ways since last year, I have been researching the ultimate prank for amusing the townsfolk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Tonight you will drink deep of the intoxicating blessings of the dark angel of Halloween! Are you ready, children?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ready! Three, two, one... Go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>My! What a magnificent display of fireworks! In such sinister hues of red and black!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Look! They're forming a jack-o'-lantern! Whoa, it's so Halloweeny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The perfect 'pleasant surprise,' wouldn't you say? I thought long and hard about how I might best enliven this carnival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Halloween only comes once a year, after all. Any who fail to prepare their most ambitious tricks are neglecting half of its delights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Just don't blame me if your most ambitious tricks get you another telling-off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hold a moment, Blanchett. I feel the rumblings of imminent inspiration...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Monsters?! And in such numbers! The fireworks must have angered them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Grrraaaargh!</td>
</tr>
