<td>Most impressive, little shaman! So that Slothstein ringleader wasn't just spouting nonsense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>How ironic of a Holy Guard operative to be traveling with an unsanctioned Alchemy user. Wouldn't you say, Siegfried?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So you were behind the Slothstein orphan kidnappings as well, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What did you do with them? Bleed them dry like when the Sakris villagers gave their blood to power their guardian?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's disgusting...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ah, you wound me with your narrow-mindedness. Did you believe I would snuff out the lives of children for my own selfish gains?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Those with Alchemic potential, I take under my care. I am merely providing them with a means to a better life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wouldn't you say it is a far better fate than dying of starvation or illness in some godforsaken sewer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Tch. You expect us to believe you're actually running some sort of daycare? You're a devil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Watch your tongue, insolent fool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hold, Asuka. They will come to understand in time. For now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Initializing... 78%.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What on earth is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My life's greatest work, whose purpose would have been made clear to you had you been more cooperative.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Alas, it seems that none of you are keen on sharing my vision! Truly a shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Perhaps some convincing is in order. Asuka?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>My Lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Let's give them a live demonstration, shall we?</td>
</tr>

<td>Adjusting in progress...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ugh... The air... Feels heavy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(This is familiar... The Alchemia particle density is rapidly increasing!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Our Alchemia particles are suffusing into the air...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Adjusting complete. Particle lock enabled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>*WHIRRRRR!*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I've got it. This must be the Core!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The one giving the Constructs their directives?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Doesn't explain why that woman can command them, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Prepare yourself!</td>
