<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Gluttony and...Saga... Is that true?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Both Narol—who was King of Gluttony at the time—and those of the Alize people had grown tired of the constant conflict between the two countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>When Beelzebub went berserk, the one who reached out to suppress that power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...was none other than Alia's son, his successor as chief of the Alize people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The reason why Gluttony was able to possess Beelzebub was because of the purifying power of Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Without it, they would not have been able to stifle the power of the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Its gluttonous force was a preemptive curse. If left alone, it would continue to eat away at the lifeblood of both countries, transforming them into deserts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>However, King Narol's secret alliance with the Alize people was the one saving grace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Because they possessed the power of the wind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Indeed. Both King Narol and Alia's son eyed the possibility that, by using the purifying, circulatory power of the wind...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>They would be able to prevent the decaying of both lands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Thus, they finally found a solution. By combining the power of the four Matters, they could seal Beelzebub in the Wind Temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This technique could serve to replace Sephiron's purifying power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>They were able to prevent the decaying of the land?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes. This continued even after King Narol was assassinated and King Ceclidis' regime ascended to power in Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Beelzebub continued to be managed in secret from within Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I guess that's because, without the Wind Temple, Beelzebub could go berserk again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>However, Alia continued to hide this truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This regardless of the fact that the rumors of Beelzebub being within Saga caused many to come in search of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes. Not even we knew about this. Alia continued to hide Beelzebub's existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If Alia was responsible for such a crucial role...how could he lose the power of the wind?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You've, of course, heard about the Lion Monarch's Charge, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...The Lion Monarch's Charge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It was the greatest battle in this history of Babel that was brought about by Emperor Orion, the Mad King of Greed Dike. What about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That war was caused by his search for the Sacred Stone. Do you think Saga, which possessed Beelzebub, was left unharmed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So Saga suffered damage during the Lion Monarch's Charge?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Indeed. Both I and Voda witnessed this with our own eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It was terrible....the acts of those who called themselves the Veda Templars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The Veda Templars...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>They targeted the Matter instead of the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>They did this to overlap the four powers of Matter and manifest the upper layer of the Mystic Tower Veda, thus disrupting it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Still, as a result, the Matter was protected...but at a significant cost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Combining the powers of Matter provides one with a power comparable to that of a Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>They figured this out because the seal placed on Beelzebub was done so by the powers of Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Thus, the Templar attacked Saga. However, at the time, the people of Saga could not comprehend why they were being attacked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Right. The people of Saga didn't know that Beelzebub was located within Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes. The truth that only the Wind Sprite Alia and the Alize people knew about was discovered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What happened then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Because of the Lion Monarch's Charge...the fact that the Alize people were connected to Gluttony...that they were managing Beelzebub...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>All that the Wind Sprite Alia had been hiding...came to light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Thus, people throughout all of Saga came to view Alia with distrust and even murderous intent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But he did it to prevent Beelzebub from going berserk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Do you think that answer would satisfy every individual within our land? The truth remains that Saga suffered massive damage because of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Thus, the Wind Sprite Alia was to be purged under the law for having placed Saga in danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The law...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yes. This much I am aware of. And you, Fuu boy...were the one who executed this purge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Alia was indeed purged...and his land fell into your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The other tribes had no choice but to blindly listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>After all, the people of Saga had never expected the balance of the Sprite Quartet to crumble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Why that happened and what interactions you exchanged with Alia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It is time you told me about it now, Fuu.</td>
