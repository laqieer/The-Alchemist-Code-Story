<td>Fuu... Why would he go alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We've got to go after him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No. We wait. Do neither of you understand the decision he's made?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Even if I do, we can't let him do this by himself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I doubt the Jam will pose any threat to him, and the entrance that Georgios cut open is still there. He shouldn't have any problem reaching the fire core in the dragon's back either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Fuu made up his mind to go alone. He must've wanted to spare you the pain of witnessing that fatal moment...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>He can't...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>He must be letting the weight of his guilt in killing Alia cloud his judgment. The fool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Tina, you stay here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But Mocca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Is this...it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Fuu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Why have you followed me?! I don't need your help. You will only slow me down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We weren't able to bring the beast to a full stop. At least let me fight alongside you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No matter what I say, you've got no intention of going back, have you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You can come along. Just don't get in my way. I'd better not hear a peep out of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Is that...the dragon's core?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You, who reap from nature and dare forget our existence...begone from this place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Out it comes! Boy, this reminds me of the old days!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Humans, why do you fight so much? Nature bears no grudge against you, yet you claim dominion over its lands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I admit we've made mistakes! We claim to live off the land, but in truth, we reap its bounty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But I believe we humans learn from our mistakes and grow stronger for them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If you're demanding payment for our mistakes, then I'll gladly give you the life of this old man. Take as much you want, just leave the people of Saga alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Fuu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I told you to stay silent! Even Alia did the same for us not so long ago! Ah... I finally get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Alia... This is how you felt, isn't it? Gahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If you will not leave, then I shall be forced to eliminate you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You're welcome to try! In exchange, I'll make sure you never lay a hand on Saga!</td>
