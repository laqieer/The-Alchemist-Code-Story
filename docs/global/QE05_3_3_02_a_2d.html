<td>Leader</td>
<td>We lament the current state of Gluttony Foss, and desire its liberation under the flags of the rightful royal family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Villager</td>
<td>Huh? Rightful...liberation...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Leader</td>
<td>That's right. I suppose you could call us the Liberation Army.</td>

<td>Leader</td>
<td>Heed me, beloved citizens of my homeland! The reign of this country is under threat from a tyrannical man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Leader</td>
<td>He has been using the name of the young Ceclidis IV to manipulate Gluttony Foss from the shadows!</td>
</tr>

<td>Leader</td>
<td>The failed invasion of Saga was plotted by his dastardly hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Leader</td>
<td>Until just a short time ago, our rightful ruler was being held captive in the royal palace—but we have successfully freed him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Leader</td>
<td>Now is the time for us to band together, take back our beloved homeland, and restore our true King to his throne!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Villager</td>
<td>What are you talking about? What is all this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Villager</td>
<td>His Royal Highness was held captive? Then the sudden tax hikes over the past few years were all...!</td>

<td>How could this be?! Are you saying we were tricked?!</td>

<td>It's sedition. He's ramping up the crisis that the village has been facing and driving it home to get the villagers riled up.</td>

<td>Leader</td>
<td>Thank you for your support.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>No need for that. It's the least we could do after everything these people have done for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Leader</td>
<td>Oh? I thought that you were guarding a merchant caravan, yet now you say that you are merely guests here? Interesting. It appears that there is more to you than meets the eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>

<td>My name is Adelbert.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>They should have arrived your way by now. They have, haven't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>Ah, yes. The supplies were indeed a huge help. However, I still cannot afford to trust you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Thought you might say that. Take a look at this. It was entrusted to me by a visitor to the Desert Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>Why, this crest! You...! You met Lady Marie?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>She filled me in on the situation. It sounds like you need the help of us desert dwellers for something or other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>Yes, I... No. We cannot talk here. I am sorry, but would you mind coming with us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>That's fine, but there are two more of us. Does that change anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>Of course not. Anyone who has been bestowed with Lady Marie's crest is an ally of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>From the sounds of things, Marie's actually a pretty important person in Gluttony Foss, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Seems like it. Anyway, we're going with him. Go let Logi and Agatha know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>A-all right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/logi.png" alt="Logi" height="128"><br>Logi</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I should have come over to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Don't be. Prioritizing Agatha was the right thing to do, Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>She's being targeted by the Collectors of Wisdom. We need to keep her out of sight of the Gluttony forces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/logi.png" alt="Logi" height="128"><br>Logi</td>
<td>I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Also... Tina's powers of foresight predicted something ominous—chaos, perhaps in the near future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>You never can be too cautious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/logi.png" alt="Logi" height="128"><br>Logi</td>
<td>Foresight...? Alchemy can do things like that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>My Alchemy can. That's the power I got when I made a contract with the Truth, but your alchemy seems to be a little different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Powers received under such a contract are meant to reflect the wishes of the user, so they change from person to person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>I wanted the power to see tragedies before they occur, so that I might prevent them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>The power to see into the future, to protect the sacred nature of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>That desire, that hope—that is what lies at the heart of the Alchemy Source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>So Tina ended up with the power of foresight. I guess that's what it means to have the power to change an undesirable future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/logi.png" alt="Logi" height="128"><br>Logi</td>
<td>Our wishes are the source of our power... Does that go for you, too, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>It does. I wished for the power to connect memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>The power to impart memories that would otherwise be lost between generations—memory Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/logi.png" alt="Logi" height="128"><br>Logi</td>
<td>So, then... It'd be the same for me, too, right? My desire, my wish...it's shaping my power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>That's right. Everyone carries a wish in their heart in some form or another, and this is what leads them to the Door of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>It is not always good fortune that they find there, however.</td>

<td>Kamui...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Sorry for rambling. That aside, at Adelbert's request, we are going to be following him to his base of operations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>However, if we are captured by the royal capital troops, our base of operations will be exposed, and all will be lost. We cannot afford to stand out too much on the roads.</td>

<td>I-I'm fine, really. Thank you for your concern. I will do my best to keep up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>We are making use of a ruined fortress that was built during the rebellion one hundred years ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>It seems that the general at the time knew what they were doing. The location is very easily defensible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>It was General Leordas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ah, so you know of him, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>So you're his descendant? Very interesting.</td>

<td>There's no one suspicious in the area, but there are some wild beasts in the pass up ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
