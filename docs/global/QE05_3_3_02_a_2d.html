<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Th-thank you! We sure are lucky you were here Mister, ummm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We lament the current state of Gluttony Foss, and desire its liberation under the flags of the rightful royal family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh? Rightful...liberation...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's right. I suppose you could call us the Liberation Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Heed me, beloved citizens of my homeland! The reign of this country is under threat from a tyrannical man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He has been using the name of the young Ceclidis IV to manipulate Gluttony Foss from the shadows!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The failed invasion of Saga was plotted by his dastardly hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Until just a short time ago, our rightful ruler was being held captive in the royal palace—but we have successfully freed him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Now is the time for us to band together, take back our beloved homeland, and restore our true King to his throne!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What are you talking about? What is all this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>His Royal Highness was held captive? Then the sudden tax hikes over the past few years were all...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>How could this be?! Are you saying we were tricked?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What's going on over there? The villagers are—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's sedition. He's ramping up the crisis that the village has been facing and driving it home to get the villagers riled up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I don't know if there's any truth to his words, but that man clearly knows what he's doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Thank you for your support.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No need for that. It's the least we could do after everything these people have done for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh? I thought that you were guarding a merchant caravan, yet now you say that you are merely guests here? Interesting. It appears that there is more to you than meets the eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So it was you we met at the border.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>My name is Adelbert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Kamui. I'm a member of the Fruit Peddlers, a courier guild.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I have heard that name before. I see, so that is why you were guarding those merchants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>They should have arrived your way by now. They have, haven't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah, yes. The supplies were indeed a huge help. However, I still cannot afford to trust you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Thought you might say that. Take a look at this. It was entrusted to me by a visitor to the Desert Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Why, this crest! You...! You met Lady Marie?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>She filled me in on the situation. It sounds like you need the help of us desert dwellers for something or other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes, I... No. We cannot talk here. I am sorry, but would you mind coming with us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's fine, but there are two more of us. Does that change anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Of course not. Anyone who has been bestowed with Lady Marie's crest is an ally of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>From the sounds of things, Marie's actually a pretty important person in Gluttony Foss, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Seems like it. Anyway, we're going with him. Go let Logi and Agatha know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>A-all right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I should have come over to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Don't be. Prioritizing Agatha was the right thing to do, Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>She's being targeted by the Collectors of Wisdom. We need to keep her out of sight of the Gluttony forces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Also... Tina's powers of foresight predicted something ominous—chaos, perhaps in the near future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You never can be too cautious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Foresight...? Alchemy can do things like that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>My Alchemy can. That's the power I got when I made a contract with the Truth, but your alchemy seems to be a little different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Powers received under such a contract are meant to reflect the wishes of the user, so they change from person to person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I wanted the power to see tragedies before they occur, so that I might prevent them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The power to see into the future, to protect the sacred nature of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That desire, that hope—that is what lies at the heart of the Alchemy Source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>So Tina ended up with the power of foresight. I guess that's what it means to have the power to change an undesirable future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Our wishes are the source of our power... Does that go for you, too, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It does. I wished for the power to connect memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The power to impart memories that would otherwise be lost between generations—memory Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>So, then... It'd be the same for me, too, right? My desire, my wish...it's shaping my power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That's right. Everyone carries a wish in their heart in some form or another, and this is what leads them to the Door of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It is not always good fortune that they find there, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Kamui...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Sorry for rambling. That aside, at Adelbert's request, we are going to be following him to his base of operations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You should explain the situation to Agatha. We leave tonight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Agatha! How are you feeling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>My body feels a little heavy, but I'm fine, thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I am sorry. We really should have prepared an extra carriage for you—you are our guests, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>However, if we are captured by the royal capital troops, our base of operations will be exposed, and all will be lost. We cannot afford to stand out too much on the roads.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I-I'm fine, really. Thank you for your concern. I will do my best to keep up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>So your base is in the south, is it? The base of the Liberation Army...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>We are making use of a ruined fortress that was built during the rebellion one hundred years ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It seems that the general at the time knew what they were doing. The location is very easily defensible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It was General Leordas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Ah, so you know of him, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It is said that he protected the Sephira who fled for their lives to the Desert Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Really, now? Well, I am glad to hear it. That is—it seems that he was a member of my house, so I cannot help but feel a little proud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>So you're his descendant? Very interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>There's no one suspicious in the area, but there are some wild beasts in the pass up ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>If we try going around them, we'll end up having to take a detour around the whole outer edge of the mountain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>What should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>This is quite the conundrum, but I think we ought to prioritize time here. Will you lend us your strength?</td>
</tr>
