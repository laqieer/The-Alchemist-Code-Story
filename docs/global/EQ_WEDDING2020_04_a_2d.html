<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Thanks for saving us back there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You're miners, aren't you? What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I thought the mine was closed due to the monsters…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>They're the reason we're here! They're jeopardizing our ability to make a living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We need to exterminate them to get the mine reopened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That makes sense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Sense? There’s nothing sensible about what just happened…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The monsters are already panic-stricken. If you antagonize them further, you’re putting yourselves in danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>As long as they're here, our jobs and our livelihoods are on the line!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There's got to be other mines where you can work. It doesn't have to be this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Try to find the silver lining in this situation and relocate to a safer area…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Are you familiar with the local legend about Felicitite?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You're referring to the custom of making wedding knives out of Felicitite, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>These special knives are said to ward of all sorts of misfortunes that might befall newlyweds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>And the couple who uses the knife together for the first time is said to be linked by an unbreakable bond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's right. Believers of that legend rely on us to keep mining.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So, we're not about to let a couple of monsters get in our way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You almost got yourselves killed by a "couple of monsters". You were lucky this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Tch... Well, I guess that's true, but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Listen, I understand your dilemma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But that doesn't mean I can allow this kind of recklessness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(Besides just because we exterminated the monsters this time doesn't mean it won't happen again.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So, from here on we're going to take over for you guys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We’ll get rid of the monsters so that you can work here again. Sounds good?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Godspeed! Our future is in your hands! We're counting on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>They all have such pride in their work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yeah…but that pride almost got them killed. Then, what would they have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Something about them was so radiant! Almost like the wedding knife I saw at the bridal fair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>*Swoon* The bridal fair was so fun. Everyone and everything seemed to shine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Whoa! Has something other than weapon-making piqued your interest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes! When the bride and groom placed their hands atop each other, it was a dazzling scene to behold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Thinking of one another and wishing for a future full of happiness. How romantic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yeah! When they joined hands, the bride and groom were beaming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Lady Lucia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>…Alright! I think I got the inspiration I was looking for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh, man. Looks like you're back to weapons now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Well, duh! I'm dead set on making a sparkly weapon like the one we saw!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Weapon craft oozes out of my every pore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hey, Lucia. Were you happy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Always making weapons--never travelling the world. You didn't regret it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huh? Making lots of weapons makes me happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I would rather live and die by that vow than to ever waver.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>As long as I stay true to myself, I'll be happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>And I'll be happy to fight alongside likeminded comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>To fight alongside a leader who vows to protect the people--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It's the greatest honor! I'd follow you to the ends of the earth, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You…enjoyed it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Of course! I could realize my ideas immediately and I had plenty of time and materials!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The only thing I didn't like was having to keep my fingers from getting worn down from working too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I really enjoyed doing what I loved every single day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(…Now I see. I was projecting my past experiences onto Lucia.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You only see what's on the surface. You aren't trying to see who Lucia truly is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>…Mei Fang was right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>(No man should decide the happiness of another.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(The miners and Lucia…they all lay their life on the line for what they love.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(No man has the right to decide how others should live their lives.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(That includes the men and comrades who died--who I'm responsible for…even him.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Don't worry. I’ll try not to influence you. I'm sure your father would be none too happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But actually…that's why I--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hey now. Don't give me that face. You're not thinking of quitting the service, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I don’t think you've ever tried to change me. Let's just keep doing our best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Besides, I'm me. I decide who I spend my time with and how I live my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>(I used to be able say things like that and smile.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>(I assumed that living a long life was the only way to be happy and that death meant sorrow.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>(I took it upon myself to carry out the will of my fallen comrades.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>(As the lone survivor, I thought that was my duty to bear--but I was wrong.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>(I put a lid on my own hopes and dreams. How could I ever smile about that?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You asked if I was happy… Didn't you say something like this before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Is that what's important to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What's important to you is protecting the happiness of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Come on. I said so from the beginning. Protecting the people is a soldier's duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>…No, that's just a facade--not as a soldier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It's not just about protecting the weak from senseless violence, either...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Protecting all lives--That's my goal as a human being. I want to walk the path I choose for myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>…You're…incredible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>It’s like you're overflowing with light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>What're you doing here? The mine is closed. You've got some nerve wandering in here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Who are you people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Well, well… I could ask you all the same thing. You don't look like miners, that's for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>...We can't have you exterminate the monsters and ruin what we've got goin' here. This place is ours!</td>
</tr>
