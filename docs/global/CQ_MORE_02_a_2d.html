<td>Phew, feels good to sweat! Nothing beats being outside on a sunny day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>*Pant* *Wheeze* I-I need…to catch my breath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, come on, Moa. It's too early to be worn out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I beg…to differ. Normal people can't keep up with this grueling course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I rarely get outdoor activity as it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh…My bad! I thought this beginner's course would be perfect for you…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>E-Eve! If this is easy, then just how difficult is your normal routine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's not too bad! Anyway, wasn't it fun to get your blood flowing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yeah. It was. I feel refreshed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I never had the chance to exercise like this before…It's all brand new to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…I'm glad! You finally smiled, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>To be honest, you've been looking glum lately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I was starting to worry. I thought if I could get you to smile, you'd cheer up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So, that's why you invited me to train with you…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, that was part of it…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But mainly, I just thought we'd have fun together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Eve…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>From this day onward, I began training with my cousin every day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The girl who always stayed inside, trying not to anger her mother, finally learned the joy of outdoor physical activity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>And I grew to like it more and more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>By the way, I meant to ask this earlier, but why do you train so hard, Eve?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I thought you might want to become a knight, but you've rejected every offer that's come your way…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's right. I don't push myself this hard because I want to be a knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I do it because it's my bridal training!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>B-Bridal training? All this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hi girls! Taking a break? I caught you at a good time, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Eve, a letter arrived from your future husband.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Your future husband?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Eeek! Mom! You're so embarrassing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>*Chuckle* Make sure to come home before dark once you finish training!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>*Sigh* It's been a while since his last letter... *Swoon* Fraise's handwriting…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>He said he was busy, so I didn't expect to receive a letter this soon… I'm so happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>*Swoon* Reading this fires me up! Maybe I'll do a bit more bridal training, after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Bridal training…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>…Eve, is Fraise the person you're doing all this training for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Uh-huh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>B-But why do you need to train at all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh? To be a happy bride, I've got to be strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, um…I see… But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(…It doesn't matter how strong you become. Nothing will change.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(There's no such thing as a happy bride.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(After all, if you fall in love in this country and get married, what follows is…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>If I could just see him before he became an insect, I'd never get married…or have a child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'd never have you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>But...nobody in this country who falls in love...and gets married can be happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Wha--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>…Uh…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(…What am I saying?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(Eve was so excited. She was beaming.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(And I ruined it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Um…It's alright, Moa. Did something trigger a bad memory?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>…No, that's not it--I'm sorry. I'm just…so sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hang on a sec, Moa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'm such an idiot. Why didn't I keep my big mouth shut?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>There was no need to say that. Eve has been nothing but nice to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...And I had to go and hurt her feelings. I feel terrible…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>All I ever do is cause pain to those I care about… First mom…and now Eve…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>…Maybe mom was right. I'm a--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>! An insect…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>How did I end up here with all these insects! I've got to escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>…But…even if I run away, I'll just end up hurting someone eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…If that's the case, I might as well let these things kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>(At least that way I won't hurt anyone ever again.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Someone like me…is better off not existing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Why… That isn't me… It's just a bug.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>It's your fault he became an insect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I lost the man I love because of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Everything--it's all your fault! I wish I'd never had you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You should have become an insect instead of him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Ah…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>…Because it's all my fault?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The fact that dad became an insect and mom became depressed…I'm to blame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>…That's why mom shouldn't have had me…I know that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I knew that…from the moment I was born!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>*Pant*...*Pant*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>(The insects, me, mom, dad, all the lovers in this country--we're all cursed.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>(The men become hideous creatures no one could love, and the women lose their lovers.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>(…Then the children are resented for causing their beloved parents such misery.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hiyaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Eve!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Moa! Are you alright? I'm glad you're safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>First things first! Let's drive back these insects--then we'll talk!</td>
