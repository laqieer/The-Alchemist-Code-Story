<td>We've withdrawn for now...but their main forces are still there! Argh! Why at a time like this...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm not even sure how many of them there are! Is there any other option besides advancing forward? No. Our only option is to advance forward and do everything we can to reach Port Nahema!</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>We can't turn back, but...if we advance forward, we'll be practically signing our death warrants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Let's go. Standing around here won't change anything. I'll lead the way. Let's aim head-on for Port Nahema!</td>

<td>005</td>
<td>There's always hope if we don't give up...isn't that right? We're not alone. Rega is here with us as well. I'm sure we'll be all right!</td>

<td>You guys don't need to be so worried! Leave this to me!</td>

<td>Rega...?! What do you think you can accomplish here on your own?!</td>

<td>I'm good at these kinds of things. Don't you remember the first time I met the two of you?</td>

<td>Orders aside...it doesn't feel right to surround three kids with this many troops.</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I wish they would hurry up and give us the signal! Maybe we should just go ahead and end it quickly.</td>

<td>What...?! The Jam?! Argh! What are they doing here?! Ahhh!</td>

<td>What's going on?! Why are the Gluttony soldiers...fighting amongst themselves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Give it a bit more time. The confusion should spread. Let's take advantage of that opening and advance forward!</td>
