<td>We'll break their ranks and rout them! Just follow my orders!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Group one, flank them and strike from the rear! Group two willâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(Good... They're all listening to what I'm saying.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(At this rate, the rest of the mission should be smooth sailing...although the sounds are still so suffocating.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hmm... Still not quite right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You should've taken the hit and closed the distance. You'll pack a lot more punch from up close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes, master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Was that better?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Not bad. You still got a little ways to go, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's the last of them. Good work, everyone. Is anyone hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We're fine, commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If there's something you want to say, I'll hear you out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Of course not, commander. I didn't mean to suggest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'd like to think I pay attention to how my subordinates are feeling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And you seem discontent with something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If I'm failing you as your commander, I'd like to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>My job is to follow your orders, commander. It's not my place to complain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have duties to attend to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>He didn't say anything at all, really...so why do I feel so guilty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Maybe I need to take a break...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah, now get right into its blind spot! That was the kind that loves to bullrush opponents, right? You gotta keep your distance against those until it's time to strike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Anyhow, it's all about experience. Keep meeting every challenge head-on and you'll figure it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Up your game for next time, okay? I know you can do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes, master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(They're loud, but not annoying. Their voices sound so peaceful and soothing... So different from the suffocated sounds I've been hearing.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What's up? My disciples caught your eye?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh! I'm terribly sorry! I didn't mean to stare, but the sound was just so calming...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Sound? What sound?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The sound of your voices. It was so cheerful and comforting, it caught my ear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh? You mean we sound like the best of buds? Well, guess I'll take that as a compliment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Getting along with my disciples is all part of my job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That way, their heads will be clearer and they'll fight better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yes... Maybe you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Something wrong? You don't seem quite all there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No, nothing. I was just thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Well, if you say so. Anyway, I meant to apologize for this bunch getting under your feet earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>They've got potential and they know the basics, but they're still a bit wet behind the ears. I'll set 'em straight by next time, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Would you mind if I asked you something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Go ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Earlier, in battle, you didn't give them any orders. Why was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You've fought those monsters before. If you'd commanded them yourself, they would have fought more effectively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>And the battle would have been over that much quicker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>If winning was all that mattered to me, then sure, I could have made their lives easier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>But if I do that all the time, they'll never have a chance to learn. I throw 'em in at the deep end because that's how they grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's how they grow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Instructions are important, but sometimes you gotta trust your students enough to let them take the reins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>And if you believe in them, they'll start to believe in themselves, and they'll fight harder for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>There's...a lot of truth to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, I remember my own instructor being very similar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>She gave me the freedom to make my own mistakes, but whenever I was about to go down the wrong path, she would always be there to guide me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Sounds like she knew what she was doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I think so. You know, you and your students resonate with the same sound she did: the sound of trust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Y-you think so? That's, uh... Aw, great, now you're making me blush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But now I have to make my own soldiers resonate with that same sound...and I don't know how.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'd completely forgotten what my instructor did for me. I'm so incompetent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You serious? From where I'm standing, you don't have anything to feel bad about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Your squad was moving like a well-oiled machine back there. You give good orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I thought so too, but the sound they make is...suffocated, somehow. It's like they're out of tune.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>And I can't afford any mistakes right now. I owe it to my instructor to do a good job on this mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hey now, don't go beating yourself up. You're lucky to have an instructor who makes you wanna do your best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I wish I'd had a master like that when I was your age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You didn't? But then, who taught you to fight like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The Tiger-King Fist was invented by yours truly. I've never had a master. Well, my old man tried to teach me to swing a sword once, but I quit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>The guy was a hell of a fighter, but a terrible teacher. Always tried to beat his students into his own image rather than letting them grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>He didn't give a crap about passing his techniques on, only about how many people he could kill in the present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>It was all about results with him. Sure, there's a time and a place for results, and for killing. I get that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>But that wasn't enough for me. My Tiger-King Fist is strong enough to defend tomorrow, not just today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>And the best way to prove it is to pass it on to the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>That's why I'm training up my disciples, see? So they can use my Tiger-King Fist to save people even after I'm gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You're looking so many steps ahead... I'm impressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Sure am! But aren't your Royal Knights pretty similar? Don't tell me you only care about the present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I've got my hands full just with training a few disciples. Doing all that while running a whole organization? Now that's impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I suppose you're right. We have to keep the peace today, but we also need to find ways to preserve it for the years to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>We can't do that by only looking at the present...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>(I was pushing myself to get results so it would reflect well on Bertha...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>(But is that really what she'd want? What's really the best way to repay her?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Excuse me, commander! We've tracked the monsters' lair down to the forest near the village. The report suggests that it is of remarkable size.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Due to the recent rainfall, they have been reproducing at an accelerated rate. We await your orders, commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>These monsters mature quickly. If we don't do something, the entire village could be in danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Get everyone together immediately. We'll deal with this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Yes, commander!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Don't forget about us! C'mon, show me I didn't train you all for nothing!</td>
</tr>
