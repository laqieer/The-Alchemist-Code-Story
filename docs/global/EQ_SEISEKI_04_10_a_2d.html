<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Hey...we finally made if halfway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I tried to say it in an exaggerated tone, but it doesn't really look that different...although I guess that's normal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hey...Captain Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Thank you for just now. If we'd continued on like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No need to thank me. We're comrades after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm not very good at moving in groups, but I love my fellow knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Captain Othima...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You're a strange one, Captain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh? Are you gonna take a shot at me for saying that? You're supposed to be moved to tears!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I thought you weren't really reliable, but actually, you seem to read the situation far in advance. Yet, at the same time, there are some things you don't do well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>To be honest, I don't know what it is you're thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>When you put it like that, I start to lose confidence about what it is that I'm thinking as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh, sorry! I didn't mean it in a bad way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hahah. Don't worry about it. After all, my nickname is the devil's child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm used to people saying that they don't understand what I'm thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The devil's child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>When I was a chid...I used to see things that I was better off having not been able to see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The presence of monsters is one thing, but I could easily see devilish fairies as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's why I can also tell which humans are going to be attacked by goblins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>And I can also predict when a fire, earthquake, or storm is coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You can really do that?! That's amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You'd think, right? I would teach others these things out of the kindness of my heart, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Eventually, they started calling me the devil's child who would attract goblins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Everyone from my village came to hate me and I was eventually almost killed. By the way, this is the mark they branded on me then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This...?! This mark is...the devil's seal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Teacher, what is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It is a mark that is branded onto those who are deemed outsiders. It's the sign of an outcast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I can't believe that someone with that mark would be within the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You just asked me why I joined the Holy Guard, right? Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>When I was nearly killed by the villagers, Lord Zain saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>He didn't care about my nickname of devil's child or my brand. He treated me without discrimination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>He said that all children have right to build their own future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>In that moment, I decided that I would follow this mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I didn't know you had that kind of past. I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's fine, it's fine. It's in the past. More importantly, wait 3 seconds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>3, 2, 1...here they are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Eek?! What's with this monster?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I've never seen a monster like that in this land before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Most likely, it's the reconnaissance army of those trying to steal the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Steal theÂ Mikaboshi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Even the Holy Guard can't hide something as big as the Mikaboshi,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>from the public for too long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>If there are any who have obtained the information and want to take the Stone for themselves...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Well, the Holy Guard will be a thorn in the side for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>In that case...I'd throw at least this much in the path they're most likely to pass. I'd probably do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Well, even if we wanted to ignore them, when they're this big, it becomes difficult. We've no choice but to pass them by force!</td>
</tr>
