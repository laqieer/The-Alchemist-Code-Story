<td>Hyaaahhh!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Glurrrrrp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I guess that pretty much takes care of them all, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It looks like it. But...no matter how many times we defeat them, they continue to sprout up. There's no end to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Voda said that Asena's power is growing weaker. Perhaps it has something to do with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Also...the Gluttony army is cultivating the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I wonder why the Gluttony army wants Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>All we can do now is speculate... Lisbeth, you better not get it infected by the Jam's blight, do you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Got it! Do you think Mocca is all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Voda is with him. I'm sure he'll be okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ughh...aaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Mocca! Are you okay?! What's the matter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Is it the blight again...? Hang in there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Mocca...?! Did you get the blight?! You just told me that you were all right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I see. You did mention that someone has been infected by the blight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes, Voda. Is there nothing you can do to help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hm. Let's try taking him to the Water Temple. I was just thinking that I needed to go back there anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh...you're going back, Voda?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I told you that my limit for carrying the Matter with me was twelve hours, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Past that time, my body will no longer be able to contain the Matter's tremendous power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That being said, other than the Water Temple, there is no vessel outside of my body that can contain the power of the Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Thus, now would be a suitable time to return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You're right. We'll need to investigate a way to make peace with Tehre.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm sure you won't mind if we act separately from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Whatever happens, let's make sure to stay in contact. Come now, Mocca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Voda...please take care of Mocca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Of course, Tamis. Tina, don't push yourself too hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What should we do, Tina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's simple enough. You promised to "Protect the village and guard it against harm."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We the Sprite are constrained by our need to reserve energy for battle and management of our Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Even if we are not carrying it within our bodies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I see. Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Understood! We'll protect and guard the village. We won't let the Jam anywhere near it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That being said...you're right, Lisbeth. There's no end to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If only we could figure out the Jam's identity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It could help us come up with a way to deal with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The Jam's identity, huh?</td>
</tr>
