<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Strong and gentle... A great and wonderful person, who paved the way to the future for many therians.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The person I admire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>She’s the only person I can listen to stories about and never feel any pain in my ears. In fact, I want to constantly hear stories about her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No one thought it was possible, but she did it. The great therian who found a place among the humans in Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Nobody expected anything of her at the beginning. But she accomplished everything through her iron will. That’s my goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Will I be able to meet the expectations that everyone has of me back home? I just don’t know. I don’t like this weak side of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That’s why I look up to her. Her and her iron will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I want to be like her. I’ll reach for my aspirations and overcome all obstacles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That’s why I have trained so much thus far. That’s why I have become stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I will join the Scarlet Flame Guard. If I want to reach and surpass my aspirations, I have no other choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>There aren’t any problems. I’m progressing as planned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...Or so I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This girl is so talented! I’m sure she’ll be the next hero of Nina’s caliber!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>As you are a representative of the Long-Tail Rabbit Clan, this Greatsword, passed down the generations of therians, is now bestowed upon you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>A Greatsword made by a blacksmith to match the athletic prowess of therians. Impressive, isn’t it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Open up a new future for the therians with this! I’m counting on you, Sharon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Thank you very much, for giving me such an extravagant farewell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>While he may be of a different race, D’Artagnan was the only other therian, aside from Nina, to rise to the esteemed rank of vice-captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>With your talent, I’m sure you’ll be able to reach and surpass them! We’re expecting a lot of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I should be happy they have high hopes of me. I shouldn’t have any problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Why is it that every time I remember that song, my ears hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I think about it every time my ears hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I’m still weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>And she’s still out of my reach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Are you okay? Does that sword remind you of something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It’s nothing... I can do the drills without any problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Um, Sharon. About that Greatsword...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Let’s start! Like I mentioned earlier, today we will be hunting nearby goblins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I’ll be grading you on how long it takes you to hunt, how many you hunt, and so on. This is closely related to your future paths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Please give it your all. I’m counting on all of you strong young rising stars to protect Envylia. Instructors, please watch over your students.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...All right, let’s begin the drills!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(So noisy... My ears hurt...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wait! Don’t go ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It’ll be fine. I haven’t trained all these years just to get defeated by goblins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You can just watch. This won’t take me long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I will slice open the future with this Greatsword. So that I can become as strong as the person I admire, and then surpass her!</td>
</tr>
