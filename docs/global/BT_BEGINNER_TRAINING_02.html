<td>My name is Ouroboros. I am the bond between Truth and the World, the Observer of Destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>I've heard the cries of your soul, wishing for the strength to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>If you so desire, I shall grant you the knowledge necessary to fight as an Alchemist of great ferocity!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Very well, then. Listen and learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>I will now teach you about Magic and Elements. Magic skills that a Mage can acquire each have an associated Element.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Elements are comprised of Fire, Water, Thunder, Wind, Light, and Dark. They all have advantages and disadvantages in relation to each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>For example, Fire beats Wind, but is weak against Water. Water beats Fire, but is weak against Thunder. Keep that in mind when facing enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Light and Dark are effective against each other. Damage is increased in either direction, which you will need to be aware of in combat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Another thing: Magic requires Cast Time before its effects take hold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>If an enemy is especially evasive, target that Unit and begin Casting. The Magic invoked will be keyed to that target.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Be warned, though, the area of effect for that magic will move along with the target. It is possible to catch your own units in the crossfire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Now, let the brilliance of your soul guide you to the unwavering truth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>You see? The damage of a single skill can change depending on the Element of your enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Even enemies difficult to defeat with Physical Attacks alone can be overcome if you understand Magic and Elements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Things may become complex with the Elements of each Unit, Skill, and Enemy coming into play, but the logic remains the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Hehehe, I accept pudding as an expression of gratitude.</td>
</tr>
