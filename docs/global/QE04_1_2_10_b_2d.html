<td>Die! You evil abomination!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Glurp...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>All right! Did we finish it off?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I can't feel anything sinister in the wind. It seems like we're okay for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>U-ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Old man, it's okay now! It's nowhere near us anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ugh... Why...would you help someone who isn't from your faction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This has nothing to do with tribes. All we did was help someone who was under attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If you wish to fight, you can always do that after the life has been saved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>People are free to quarrel...but that's a choice only the living can make, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Watching someone die...is more painful than death itself. Don't you think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Tina...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It truly is more painful than death. Truly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What are you babbling about...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You, over there! This is all your faction's fault that Saga is in the state that it's in! Have you forgotten?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Are you talking about the Fuu faction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh...are you some kind of foreigner? Their boss...Fire Sprite Fuu is the cause of all this conflict amongst the Saga tribes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>When the Sprite Quartet became the Sprite Trio...it destroyed the equilibrium in Saga. It messed up all best relationships and ties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Are you talking about...when the wind tribes went extinct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Fine then. I'll explain it in a way that a foreigner like you can understand. This is about the laws of nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Earth creates, water nourishes, fire heats, and wind carries all that is created from the other elements. In this way, the circle of life is maintained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Water and earth create the cold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Fire and wind create heat. Fire and earth create dryness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Water and wind create moisture. In this way, the equilibrium of Saga was maintained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>And that equilibrium was destroyed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes, indeed. Saga lost its wind. Without moisture, the dryness expanded. The heat was suppressed by the cold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Saga grew cold and dry, and the Fuu faction began to take over the lands and waters that no longer had a guardian.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The alienated Voda faction began to only protect their own forests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We, from the Tehre faction, found a way to take advantage of Port Nahema; we engage in trade with the outside world instead of just limiting ourselves to Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Also, the wind didn't go extinct; it was destroyed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The last wind people of Alize were annihilated by the Fire Sprite Fuu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
