<tr>

<td>Fine then. I'll explain it in a way that a foreigner like you can understand. This is about the laws of nature.</td>

<tr>
<td>Merchant</td>
<td>Earth creates, water nourishes, fire heats, and wind carries all that is created from the other elements. In this way, the circle of life is maintained.</td>

<td>Water and earth create the cold.</td>

<tr>
<td>Merchant</td>
<td>Fire and wind create heat. Fire and earth create dryness.</td>

<td>Water and wind create moisture. In this way, the equilibrium of Saga was maintained.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>And that equilibrium was destroyed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Merchant</td>
<td>Yes, indeed. Saga lost its wind. Without moisture, the dryness expanded. The heat was suppressed by the cold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Merchant</td>
<td>Saga grew cold and dry, and the Fuu faction began to take over the lands and waters that no longer had a guardian.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Merchant</td>
<td>The alienated Voda faction began to only protect their own forests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Merchant</td>
<td>We, from the Tehre faction, found a way to take advantage of Port Nahema; we engage in trade with the outside world instead of just limiting ourselves to Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Merchant</td>
<td>Also, the wind didn't go extinct; it was destroyed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Merchant</td>
<td>The last wind people of Alize were annihilated by the Fire Sprite Fuu!</td>
