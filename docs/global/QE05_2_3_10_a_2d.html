<td>Right, right. In a pretty sick way, it's impressive just how well it's going. Looks like there's even a chance his campaign might reach all the way here to our little desert.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>Huh. I guess...for it to have become a beachhead for this current invasion, Greed Dike must have taken an awfully long time to raise an army.</td>
