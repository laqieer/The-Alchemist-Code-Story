<td>Oh, hey. What's up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I've heard rumors that the Lion Monarch's invasion has begun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Right, right. In a pretty sick way, it's impressive just how well it's going. Looks like there's even a chance his campaign might reach all the way here to our little desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I doubt that would come to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That Lion Monarch's got his eye on the prize, you know: world domination. Still, you seem pretty confident. What do you know that I don't?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well, I've been puzzling over why Greed Dike would destroy Wadatsumi for some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh. I guess...for it to have become a beachhead for this current invasion, Greed Dike must have taken an awfully long time to raise an army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Just as when Sephiron was destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I remember... There were reinforcements from Greed Dike among Ceclidis' soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>And? Sephiron, Wadatsumi... I'm not seeing the connection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>They both needed those two adversaries gone, especially Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Now the Lion Monarch has taken pains to occupy Envylia and Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Then...their target is the Sacred Stones?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Or something else with the same depth of power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>As bittersweet as this truth is, it is lucky for us that there is nothing of the like left here in the Desert Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Can't argue with that logic. Still, better safe than sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I mean to be prepared for the hypothetical moment they take even a single step into my desert. Are you ready for this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I am. I am also unable to rest easy while that Lion Monarch roams free.</td>
