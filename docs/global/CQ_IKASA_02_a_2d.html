<td>001</td>
<td>Haaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Phew... That takes care of the monsters around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Good job, Ikasa. You almost single-handedly took down all of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Thank you very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Although I suspected there would be monsters in the area, I didn't expect them to be so aggressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes. Perhaps they became aggressive due to those subjects...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Subjects...? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It seems you don't know that particular detail. Though it should've been shared with anyone involved...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Never mind. It's not something to worry about. Let me tell you the details about this mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You may have heard, but the people who used this location as their base experimented with alchemy and the strengthening of monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>All of the test subjects in the ruins were supposed to have been disposed of at the time of this discovery, but it seems that some of them had escaped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see... So you are here to help take care of unfinished business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, seems that's what it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I understand now. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's certain that the test subjects are around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It seems that there are no remnants of the group around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But seeing how those monsters acted, the test subjects must be near. We have to take care of things before anyone gets hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>From now, we won't just be patrolling. We'll also be on a hunting mission. But with your skills, there shouldn't be any problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(To have some test subjects escape... This would be an embarassment for the Holy Guard. But I'm not sure why the captain had to come out here...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Although...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What's wrong? You look unsure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Not unsure... Just a little confused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>About what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You know I have the skills to defend myself, so I don't understand why you came along with me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Didn't I say that I was eager to see you in action? And...because I wanted to have a chat with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>A chat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yeah. After being recruited, things were busy so we never had a chance to talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I thought I could hear your answer to that question I asked way back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>There is great aptitude for alchemy and strong power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>However, after further examination, there may be danger of her leaning towards darkness. It is unwise to make her a member of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>But, we must make use of her power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(If I'm not allowed, then I'm not allowed... This just feels troublesome now.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(It'll be a bit disappointing, not being able to become a "knight"...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(With the opportunity lost, there's probably nothing else for me...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova. What is your opinion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>She has considerable alchemy within her. It would be a wasted opportunity if we didn't do anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Although...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Of course, if I can understand your concerns, so how about this? I'll take care of this newcomer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>..!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>As the captain of the 4th Regiment, I'll take full responsibility for making sure her power is used correctly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Well, Captain Cadanova. If you're willing to go that far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Then it's decided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And that's how things will be. Welcome, Ikasa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Thank you...very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>By the way, there was a question I forgot to ask you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It was, "when you become a knight, what will you use your power for?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>My power...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Your motivation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You said that there was nothing in particular, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Was that my answer...? You seem to remember it clearly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I wouldn't forget it. Especially with someone saying that so honestly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I took your words seriously, as someone that needed guidance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I was able to see your skills. It's true that you have power...but that's what scares me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You have no mercy in taking down enemies. Your powers don't hold you back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Having that power is a double-edged sword. Because you know how to control yourself, you won't lose yourself so easily...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>However, if you don't have a purpose for your power, one day you may lose control and endanger yourself and those around you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>So you want to know what I'd like to use my powers for, as of now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yeah. You didn't have a sense of direction then, but how about now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Did you find a purpose after becoming a knight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Well, not yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I don't know if I'll find one. I don't think I've changed much since then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I feel sorry, as you've looked after me and hoped for me all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Then why even bother coming to our gates? What made you want to become a knight in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>That is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...what I aspire to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I swear my love and loyalty to you, princess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>It's just...a child that is really important to me once said to me "I like knights."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I know. It sounds so childish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Why do you say that? It's a perfectly good reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Then, for the sake of that child, you must encourage yourself more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Really? Is that a purpose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Why not? It's important as a memory for you, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>For an important child. That's a great purpose. A knight that stands to protect what is important is a great knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I see... so that's what it means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>(Even if that's right, for me to be a knight...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>!!! That monster...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>There's a test subject branding on it. It came from over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Grrraaaaaaaarrgh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>This is going to be a tough one. Let me give you a hand. Ikasa, let's go!</td>
</tr>
