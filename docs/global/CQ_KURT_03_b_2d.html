<td>Uggrraaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Looks like you're the only one left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>A-ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>P-please, stay your blade! I was just trying to earn some coin! I have no quarrel with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>S-so don't k-kill me. Please! I have a daughter. She's just a little girl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You there. Listen to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Y-yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If you have someone who you wish to protect, then you ought to wield your blade for that purpose alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Y-you're right, Iâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Now go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>R-right! I'm so sorry for...you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Stay out of my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ngh! Haa...haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So long as one has their life, the opportunity for mutual understanding exists. Kill one another, and all possibilities end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What if you let someone go and they end up coming back one day to kill you again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Then I would be forced to fight them again, perhaps multiple times over. As many times as they needed until they decided to sheathe their assassin's blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I will do whatever is necessary to remain true to my beliefs. All I can do is grow stronger, so that I may overcome every challenge in my life without needless death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What if I... Actually, what if one of your ex-disciples hired me to assassinate you? What would you do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Regardless of who my opponent may be, I will not cede to my emotions. Your blade is true. I have faith in your judgement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>A job is a job. You and I go head to head, one of us is gonna end up falling down and never getting back up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The argument is moot. I hardly doubt anyone would be so extravagant as to pay to have me killed. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I will not kill you. Nor do I have any intention of simply rolling over and dying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I will restore Wadatsumi to a place in which one can live without fear. In order to do that, I believe with all my being that I must wield my blade mercifully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I won't give up until all of Wadatsumi is safe to live in again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wake up! That's never going to happen. You're just being naive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes... Perhaps I am naive. So what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You have a sweet tooth. Does that make you a child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>In a world where killing is in demand, I consider the most valuable strength to be that which allows one to refrain from killing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Some would say you're childish to believe in such things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Some would say you're childish for having a sweet tooth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yet your blade is true. I know that any meeting of our blades would be honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Now that I know that, I will not falter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The strength to refrain from killing, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You know what I think? In a world where mercy is considered strength, only those who practice your way would flourish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Eventually your naivety would spread, until no one even thought of killing others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I bet my favorite dessert would taste even sweeter in a world like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Reimei...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Until that day comes, however, I will do what I need to do. I will carry out my work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Someday, if we do end up going head to head, I want you to face me as you are now. Keep those convictions of yours close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The path you have chosen will be a long one. Until the day the people of this world understand the value of mercy, I guess I could be something like your forerunner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Sounds good to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You carry out your duty, and I'll carry out mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'm going to have to do something about my impoverished lifestyle, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Even though I'm powerless to change the world or prove my point right now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The way of the Sosenko isn't wrong. An assassin's dagger will not save this world, or its people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>So all I can do is spread my beliefs by way of this blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Perhaps it isn't quite their area of expertise, but I might ask the owner of that sweet parlor for the secret to their business's longevity. Continuing a business for a hundred years is no small feat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I must embody my ideology if I am to realize it, and become stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>After all, I can't let down that sweet-toothed guy who said he'd be my forerunner.</td>
</tr>
