<td>001</td>
<td>Hah! We match.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What're you looking at?! You reek of alcohol! Your breath stinks! Your hair is a menace! Keep your stinky breath, freaky eyes, and ugly mug away from me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Gimme a break. Just makin' an observation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What did you mean? "We match"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm talkin' about the scar on your face. It's a big ol' cross, just like mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hmm... Come to think of it, how'd I get this scar, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Don't ask me. You've had it since I met you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well, whatever the reason, it just doesn't seem to want to heal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So? It's cool. Crosses are rad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm sayin' it suits you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I don't get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So, what about you, old man? Are you thinking of joining the Templars?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm going to help you reach the top of Mystic Tower Veda. However, I don't plan on joining another organization in this lifetime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You made an enemy of Greed Dike, right? Well, the Shadow Messiah made an enemy of the Holy Order. What's one extra enemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It wouldn't hurt me...but it might hurt you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Not very friendly, are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Neun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm just sayin'... The people of Lost Blue don't have a choice in the matter. We've got no money, no food...just our fists. We have to go head to head with the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's the only way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Since you're here and all...why not do everything you can? What's the point of holding back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Tch. You're just a coward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hey, uh...gramps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We kill a lot of people, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And we do a lot of bad things. We're not afraid to torture our enemies. In fact, we enjoy it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We're a real pack of monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>As for our noble mission... Like cheap torches, we only light up the path of the people closest to us. Not to mention, we're the biggest bunch of egotistical maniacs this world has ever seen. We're even pretty shady in our dealings with each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>All we really do for the citizens of Lost Blue is convince them that they're good people, then let them live the way they want, because we sure can't do anything else for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I mean, our leader actually said that, right now, the best we can do is focus on making the people here feel welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So... Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Why are you thanking me? I've already made it clear I'm not joining your organization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's enough that you're helping out. You're seem crazy strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Besides, having a samurai watch our backs is pretty cool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm not a real samurai.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Anyway, I was thinking... Since you're helping us out anyway, why not climb the tower with us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Didn't you hear him? He's not a real samurai. What do you want to take a fake samurai along for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Because!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Because, what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Excuse me. I...have to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hah. I've never met someone so gutless. He won't even rise to an insult when it's rubbed in his face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Apparently he has kids, up in the Slothstein slums.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Well, if he doesn't start contributin', he won't have 'em for long. Everyone in this area, above and below, is on the verge of starving to death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>He's planning on leaving them behind when he has to go fight in a faraway battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wait... I thought he said his kid died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I remember him spouting some nonsense about reuniting with his lost wife and kid on top of the tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well, there's meant to be immense power up there, right? The font of the Alchemy Source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Even normal Alchemy is powerful enough to turn Alchemia into life, however briefly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Imagine what the Alchemy Source could do! You could probably use it to reshape the world to suit your ideals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You could also use it to bring your loved ones back from the dead, or heal them with a wave of your hand... At least, that's what he believes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>On what grounds?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Y'know...sometimes, you just have to believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Feh. No point bringing anyone back if the world's gone to hell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>That's why we're searching for a solution to all the world's problems, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Even if we can't fix our mistakes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>We don't want to die without having tried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Found them. So this is where the remnants of the Shadow Messiah have been holing up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Kill them. All of them. Don't let a single one of them escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>They are to meet the same fate as Ila and Mia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>After I disposed of the assassins, I noticed that there was a picture book on the bed. It was a story about a samurai.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Come on, Mimi! Sit properly. Be a good girl, now. Look! Mister Cuddles is sitting down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>On to the next part! This one's my best story yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Not just any samurai...me. The book was filled with the stories I had told Ila and Mia of my travels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Isn't this fun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>In this place, this hard-won slice of safety and comfort, Ila and Mia would act out these stories with the other orphans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>But the samurai was only ever a hero among the pages of that book.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>A man without honor. A fool. A murderer. A lowly chess piece. Once unshakeable of spirit, I became a deserter of my own heart. Even my blade wept to see me fall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>No one is going to forgive you for the wrongs you have committed. Murder, betrayal, treason...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>(You abandoned them, didn't you?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>(You fought for the revival of the Shadow Messiah without once mentioning their names.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>(That is how you protected them. You imparted your ambitions unto Ila and Mia, then embarked on a journey of rebirth, all so that you could live in the darkness. In doing so, you found a new path.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>(Meanwhile, I fell into disgrace.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>(These wounds are deep.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I made an enemy of all I encountered: the emperor of my homeland, the allies of justice, the Flame Dragon, and the man who forged my katana.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>(No one's going to save me this time.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Surrounded by enemies, the whole world his foe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>(I have no one left. No one to smile at me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Karma always catches up with us in the end. I deserved this fate, for all the wrongs I committed, for all the deaths I caused, and for turning my back on the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>(No one to remember me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Where's Mister Samurai?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Mister Samurai will protect us! He's our bodyguard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>This opportunity is too good to waste. Their protector is nowhere in sight. Dispose of them, quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>S-stay away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ila!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>For a bunch of brats, you've done well. You anticipated our raid and evacuated the orphanage. You even managed to fight us off all this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Wh-where's the samurai storybook?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>We left it behind! M-Mister Samurai doesn't even know we're here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Y-you leave these kids alone, or I'll tear you limb from limb!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I suppose that means we should kill you first, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Run, Mia! You have to get them to safety!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I-I... I'm not sure I can! M-my legs feel like they're made of jelly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Mia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Mister Samurai! Help! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Ahahahahahahaha! Bwahahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>What the...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>M-Mimi! No! Stay back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Ahahahahahaha! Hahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Hush, Mimi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Ahah... Ungh... P-papa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Mimi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Pa...pa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Papa! Papa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Papa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>A tool with a soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>A vessel with a heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>How could I forget?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>How can you get up after that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Even if I am forgotten...I cannot forget.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>My scar is burning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I will undo this wound. I will reclaim my loved ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I will bring back my family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I am a tool no longer. I have a soul, and a will of my own. I am a samurai!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Rise, and let the rivers of blood turn to fire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Fool... If you run now...you could yet...survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>If you keep pushing yourself, you won't last long! Your wounds need healing—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Nothing can heal me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Yes... Your wounds are beyond repair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Your body is doomed to break.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>You cannot recover naturally. You will not live long enough to see those children grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>You will die before you settle down with a family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>My wounds are as permanent as the cross on my face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>For in order to obtain the powers of the alternate dimension, you had to sacrifice all your ties to healing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Laugh if you will! Tell me I am not worthy of calling myself a samurai! Tell me I am weak, and cowardly, and worthless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Open your eyes, and place the rusted blade on the pyre!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Tell me that it's pathetic to put up a fight now, when the play is already over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>My apologies. I tend to run my mouth a bit when I'm afraid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>(I'm still as much of a coward as you were, my love.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Huh?! He sheathed his katana!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>He's preparing an Iai stance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I will slice apart anything that stands in my way. I will rend through darkness, truth, and hell itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>For the light of that day awaits me, and I would do anything to reach it! My heart is warm, because that distant light is my strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>And it is powerful enough to light a fire in the hollow grate of my soul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>The blade...has gone quiet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Even should this perpetual rage change me into a bloodthirsty demon...it will not become a light of remorse, but remain one of hope!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Lord Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Be ready. That stance means trouble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Train the arm and polish the blade, for this katana was the final one made!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Keep your distance, Kanon! If you get too close, he will cut you down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Now swing it well, samurai, and be prepared to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>You know what Mister Samurai did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>We come to the end, foretold by my deeds. I am but a shadow of who I was, devoid of dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>He searched far and wide, till he found us a home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Even more thrilling in flesh than in tale! Let his samurai soul burn on and prevail!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>He went out to find an answer, and he was gone for a long time. He made a bunch of mistakes, and got hurt lots, and had to start over again several times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>But even when he was covered in scars and scratches, he kept going. He kept searching.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>This is the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Mister Samurai isn't here right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>I have been prepared for this moment since I made this mark upon my face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>We're a real pack of monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>He's gone to turn the world on its head!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Yet don't you sometimes find thrilling plays a bore? Aren't poetic monologues enough to make you snore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Hark, impetuous youth, your audience I crave!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Fools! You will regret this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>I am not destined to play the part of the hero.</td>
</tr>
