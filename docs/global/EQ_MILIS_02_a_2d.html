<td>Yep! That's one big catch! Now I can make lots of water lizard cuisine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh? What's the matter, Lofy—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Just hide over here! Quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hey, hold on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wow. What strange people. Looking at them crossing the forest in such heavy armor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The Holy Guard? What are they doing so near Lustburg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Lofy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm sure the Court Mage Order wasn't contacted. Did they cross the border without any notice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>There's something fishy going on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Lofy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Eeek?! Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You went quiet all of a sudden. I got worried. Are they bad people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Not exactly, but...all people have the potential to do bad things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Milis, go back to Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What about you, Lofy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I need to fulfill my duty. It's necessary to find out what they're up to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Then I'll go with you! Two are better than one! I won't get in your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's true that your skill with the bow may be useful, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then rely on me. We're friends, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Um...yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Let's get this over with. Then we can go back to Lustburg and eat water lizard cuisine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'd prefer sweets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Don't say that! It's my favorite food!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Then let's pursue them! A Saga hunter never loses her prey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We've scouted our nearby surroundings. There are no signs of suspicious activity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There are traces of a landslide throughout the entire area. The ruins were mostly likely exposed as a result.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Very well. It seems our intel was accurate. Too accurate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What shall we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>As the Holy Guard, we cannot abandon the ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The main squadron will enter the ruins with me. Keep a lookout at the entrance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I don't think that's necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's a precaution. This mission is shrouded in secrecy. We must be prepared for any event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Look! Over there! There are ruins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ruins in a place like this? I've never heard of that before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Judging by the movement of the Holy Guard, could they be from the ancient age of Alchemy? But where did they get the information from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well, what should we do? Should we report back to someone important?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Fortunately, there aren't many guards, and they seem careless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Milis, can you lend me your strength?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Okay. Let's move on my signal. 1, 2...3!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What?! Who are you—</td>
