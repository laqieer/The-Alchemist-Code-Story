<td>Only one left! It's all yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>All right, leave it to me! Full Throttle!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Nice work. Looks like that's the last of them. Hey, stop that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But you said you'd answer my questions! I need to know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>All right, all right! This is called omni-directional mobility gear, or ODM gear for shortâ€”h-hey! What're you doing?! Don't pull it apart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Don't worry! I'm a genius! Hmm, I see, so it goes together like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't you dare break... Hmph. What are you doing carrying such an unstable weapon around for, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's not unstable! This was the last machine my dad invented. It's meant to take down the Giant Taurus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The Giant...Taurus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh?! You don't know about the Giant Taurus? They're way too big to miss! Where the hell are you from anyway?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's what I'd like to know. A world I don't know, with Titans I've never seen before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>God dangit. So, I guess these Giant Taurus must be a lot like the Titans we just fought, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Kinda. So, anyway, this is my Anti-Giant Taurus Mecha Weapon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Heavy firepower to burst open those tough scales! Heavy weaponry that allows even a weakling like me to take on a monster like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>My dad wanted to use this Mecha Weapon to take out the Giant Taurus and bring peace to the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So what are you doing on the battlefield? Where's your dad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>He...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I cannot let it end here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Judith, I leave the Mecha Weapon, and my hope for this world, to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I guess you've had your fair share of troubles too, huh? You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You can't rely on justice to save the day. That's why I've gotta do this for my dad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>People who talk about justice all the time don't actually get anything done. I'll be the one to take down the Giant Taurus with my Mecha Weapon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I guess you could say that that's my idea of justice. Here you go! I put it back together again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>H-hey... It moves! You're really something! I've got to warn you though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If you wanna take down those Giant Taurus, or whatever, you'll have to find their weakness first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I suppose that's what that weapon of yours is for, but just swinging it around at random won't get you anywhere. See you around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Where are you going?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I have things I need to do too, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I don't know you, but I think I understand some of what you're feeling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Life's tough, but keep your chin up, all right kid? Bye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ah! I forgot to ask for his name! I wonder if we'll see each other again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Swinging it around at random won't get me anywhere, huh? Looks like there's room for improvement, especially in the power unit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I still can't get it to open though... What did dad put in here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Anyway, that guy was right, whoever he was. I gotta find the Giant Taurus' weakness first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>More Titans?! All right... Here I go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>She's over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Arrrrgggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Eren, don't barge in by yourself. It's too risky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This is nothing! I'm gonna wipe the floor with them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Eren, don't be reckless! You'll get yourself killed before we can return to our world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
