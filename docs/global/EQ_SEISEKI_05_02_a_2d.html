</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Well then, let's go. We cannot be late. Let's head to the shortest route.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We must, by no means, be traced...right? Leave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are you talking about me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Kudan...! What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm being left here on my own, so isn't it normal to want to know the content of the conflict?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but we can't reveal the details of the plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Don't get me wrong, Kudan. We're not excluding you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The reason why we're leaving headquarters under your care is that we trust in your ability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I cannot reveal the details, but in a certain land, an artifact was discovered—one that could potentially threaten this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>From now, we go to destroy it...that is our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Lord Commander, that...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's fine. The power contained in this artifact is so unknown that we, the entire Holy Guard, must take it on together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>In that case, my power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No...there's something more important than our battle strategy...and that's the safety of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Do you understand, Kudan? There are those of us who implement local missions...and those who uphold the safety of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>When these two wings are both well established, that's when this strategy works for the first time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Because you are the most reliable, I am ordering you to remain behind. Please understand this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Right now, I don't have time...but, once I get back, I'll discuss this with him until he's convinced. I'm counting on you, Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Lord Commander, let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hm. Let me say something more plausible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Did you hear that? All of it was just your attempt to sow distrust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The Lord Commander trusts me in that way. He leaves me here because he acknowledges my strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If that's true, why did he secretly take the 4th Regiment with him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The one who carries the Wadatsumi royal bloodline... what was her name again, Kagura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Did you know that Zain is taking her with him to Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Kagura?! Wait for a second, what are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Most likely, he'll use her bloodline in order to obtain the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Keeping you behind wasn't an act of acknowledgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>He is taking advantage of her power, and, knowing that you're close to Kagura, he wanted to avoid any hinderance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That's nonsense! You're being absurd...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>In that case, how about you ask that knight called Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That is if she hasn't already left this land. Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ack...! No way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Captain! Those from headquarters ask that you hurry! Command over headquarters has already been transferred to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hey! Did you see Kagura?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Huh? Kagura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, now that mentioned it, I haven't seen her since last night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>She didn't show up for breakfast this morning either. Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Tsk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Search for Kagura! I'm going to be gone for awhile! Tell the Vice-Captain to head towards headquarters. Understood?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huh...?! Ye-yes, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It can't be... Could Waginau's nonsense actually be the truth? Kagura, you too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>?! Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Reimei...I am the last person you will see in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>A smoke bomb?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It's over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Whoooo!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Apparently, it's not coincidence that he was avoided yet again. The captain of the 4th Regiment holds his own quite well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Are you an assassin?! Who hired you?! Was it Greed Dike?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Who knows?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You're not here under the Lord Commander's orders, are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hmph. There seems to be quiet a lot of opponents. The one who hired me, well...you can say that he's in the next life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The next life?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Can't you remember? Search the corners of your memory...as you die!</td>
