<td>That's about the lot of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Voda, are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes... Tina, you've proven to me your power of the wind...and your resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I have been entrusted with the lost power of the wind. I am sure there is some meaning to this. I promise to save Saga from this crisis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I accept your resolve...and will respond likewise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Then...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes. I'll accompany you...to the Fuu faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We cannot allow the Forest of Rukifojio to become a battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Thank you, Voda!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Well then, let's hurry before the Gluttony army gets here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Wait. Before that, there's one more thing I must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What's that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Stay where you are and observe. It'll be problematic if something were to happen in my absence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Is that...the Water Matter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I, the Enforcer of Water...summon you, Water Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>In honor of our covenant, my flesh will serve as your abode!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The Water Matter...is entering Voda's body?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The one who controls the Matter has the ability to contain and manage it within their body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I cannot afford to leave it here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Amazing! It's like magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well then, let's make our way to Fuu. I wonder how long it's been since I've seen him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Here they come again, Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I'd truly like to help you, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>When I carry the Matter within me, it requires all my willpower to manage it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's unfortunate since I'd love to give them a taste of my water Ouija.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't worry! We'll handle this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I can only hold the Matter within me for up to twelve hours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I must finish my talk with Fuu before then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Protect me and lead Saga to its former glory, Tina!</td>
</tr>
