</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What's that supposed to mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I think you've made that quite self-evident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Don't play mind games with me! And quit looking at me like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>With Captain Kaya gone, her second-in-command will have to fill her position. Which means the 2nd Regiment of the Holy Guard will be led by this reckless pair of living sideburns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hey! Leave my sideburns out of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I predict that one day those sideburns are going to merge so fully with your beard that you'll become indistinguishable from a terrier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Stop making weird predictions! Actually, I might just try that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Kaya said that Monzein's passion makes him a pillar upon which the Holy Guard can depend. I trust her judgement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hah! See?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm afraid I have to disagree. Kaya ran a tight operation. I'm not convinced her deputy can manage things as effectively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>And yet Kaya is the one who appointed him vice-captain. Not only that, but I'm pretty sure she put you two together for a reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>His axe cleaves the sky in two, while your arrows read the wind. He can cover your front, and you can cover his back. You'd make a good team.</td>
</tr>

<td>Hahaha! Come on, Seida! You know you can count on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I could count your braincells, that's for sure.</td>

<td>That's the spirit!</td>

<td>Hm?</td>

<tr>
<td>029</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Sure.</td>

<td>Go home, Othima. Get some rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Nope. Sorry. Can't do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I can handle this alone. You need to rest. It's important—and mandated. Off with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Let me get this straight. The head of our order, the Most Reverend Bishop Waginau himself, is missing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Not only that, but the former Captain of the 2nd Regiment of the Holy Guard disappeared without a trace after she handed in her resignation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>To make matters worse, Greed Dike—the big, powerful nation right next door—seems primed to attack us at any moment! You think I have time to rest?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Everything's such a mess... You sure you don't know anything about all this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Sorry to disappoint... but no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Reaaally?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>

<td>You think I'm a bit of a playboy, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Go home, Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But you know, more experience means more heartbreak, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Go. Home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>So I know what you're going through—I know what it's like to get dumped. You don't even know what you have till you lose it. It's even harder when it's someone special.</td>
</tr>

<td>...</td>

<td>It's what she always used to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That's the point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>So please quit telling me to go home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Sorry for dropping by so late!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Huh, Kanon? What's all that stuff you're carrying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Just some lights to brighten your night!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Sorry for the trouble, new kid. Guess I'm going to be pulling another all-nighter... Feel like joining me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>No, thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Darn. Rejected again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Lord Zain, you shouldn't work in the dark, either! You'll damage your eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I... Right. Thanks, Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Here, take a light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>An... oil lamp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Are you going around handing out lamps to everyone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yup! I hate feeling useless—I figured this was the least I could do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>How sweet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You can't get through all the paperwork and reading you have to do without light! So I rounded up a bunch of lamps to distribute to our hard-working captains!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Well, you've got the right attitude, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Yes? Did you have a complaint?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Just a little one. The oil lamp you placed there isn't just lighting up those books—it's burning them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>N-no way! Fire! It's on fire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Ahh, this is nice. My fingers feel all toasty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Othima!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah. I'll head home already...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Don't go home now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>But you just told me to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Oh no, oh no, oh no! What have I done?! What do we do?! Aaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Fine, I'll handle this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You did it! Oh, thank goodness! A round of applause for Othima!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ice magic sure is handy. It can even prevent housefires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>L-Lord Zain, I am so sorry! I guess I really am useless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>It's the thought that counts, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>So many documents went up in flame!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>The more fiery the thought, the better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Do people actually say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Come on. I'll help you hand out the rest of these oil lamps, make sure they arrive safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Are you sure? Won't that get in the way of your work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>It's fine. I'm going to be here all night, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Hey, you told me not to go home yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Your letter was among the documents that burned that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Ha... haha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>It was startling how quickly those white sheets turned black and started crumbling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Haha... Hahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>It's all gone... All of you is... gone. Your words are mine to read no longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Hahaha... haha.. ha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I recalled the smile you wore that day—the day you scoffed at the thought of me making you smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>That's when I noticed something else among the ashes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>An... aster?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>It was the bookmark I had given you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>You sent it back to me... You must have really...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I tried to read what was left of the only letter you ever sent me one more time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Please don't try to get involved with me. Just forget about me instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I remember what it used to say, but the fire had burned away most of the words. Now it read:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Please don't —————————————— forget about me —————.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>That's where my talent for inspired understanding comes in handy. When something's missing, I fill in the gaps—but that's half the fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I looked back on Kaya's resignation letters—the pile of them I had collected over the years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>You know... When you told me that you'd perfect the Holy Guard so that I could resign when it suited me... I was really touched.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Kaya...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>They never leave you, do they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>You entrusted them to me, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Those words you wish you'd said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I've finally received them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>The regret... It stays with you, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Yet you cover it up with pretty words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>All we can do is our best, and continue to pass this task onto the next generation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>There are things I want to pass on, and people I want to entrust them to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>People who I believe can find a way to carry that which I could not shoulder alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>So I leave behind my words, in the hope that they will mean something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>This will be my will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Even should my light disappear from this world, I believe that there are those who will shine on in my absence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I shall leave this diary behind as my will and testament.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>I do enjoy stories, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Next time, I'll tell you a story that'll make you smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>May this bookmark light the way, as a lantern illuminates the pages of a story read at twilight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I shall entrust this half-read story to those who will succeed me.</td>

<td>But I'm afraid he shines too brightly for this world.</td>
</tr>

<td>...</td>

<td>For his brilliance is such that it catches on places that do not wish it—like your Lost Blue. His light brings you nothing but misery.</td>

<td>Zain... Your light is like a flurry of unwanted, unaddressed packages. Allow me to return them all to you.</td>
</tr>

<td>At first, they will be your life raft—but sooner or later you shall drown, slowly, painfully, under their weight.</td>
