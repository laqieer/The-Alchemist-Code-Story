</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/meif.png" alt="Mei Fang" height="128"><br>Mei Fang</td>
<td>Indeed. Perhaps standards are important, but so long as doing so does not infringe upon others, people should be allowed to enjoy the occasion as they wish.</td>
</tr>

<tr>

<tr>

<td>Yay! The jack-o'-lanterns are all orange again! Halloween colors are the best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Rrr... Well, I am sure my comrades will agree with me! What say you, O Sweet Children of Rot und Schwarz?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Child of the Resistance</td>
<td>Huh? Actually, we thought the red pumpkins were a bit weird.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>T-traitors!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Looks like getting support on that one might be a little tricky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Bringing people together is no small feat. Unifying the hearts of one's comrades is challenging indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cher.png" alt="Cheryl" height="128"><br>Cheryl</td>
<td>All things considered, I cannot allow your red-and-black jack-o'-lanterns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>However, I will grant you special permission to change the color scheme of the other decorations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cher.png" alt="Cheryl" height="128"><br>Cheryl</td>

<tr>

<td>Rejoice, good people, for this conqueror of darkness, this white-winged demoness, is at your service! I will paint the town in crimson and pitch black! Teeheehee... I am tingling with excitement!</td>
