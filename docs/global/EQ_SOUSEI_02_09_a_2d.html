<td>Hold on, let me just sit here... Now, what would you like to know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The Gears of Judgement... What exactly are they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>How is it that your powers can affect Asmodeus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>To answer those questions, I must explain the results of the research that I've been conducting in this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I've mentioned it before, but I don't know where these Cursed Beasts came from, nor do I know what they are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But they do have certain habitual patterns that I have discovered through vigilant observation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Vigilant observation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Stalking them, to put it simply. To kill Asmodeus, I followed its footsteps and took note of its every action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I learned that their operational capacity is proportionate to the size of the world's human population.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?! You mean the more people there are in the world, the stronger the Cursed Beasts are?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That doesn't make sense. Aren't they made to eradicate humans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's an interesting thing you mentioned, my young friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Let me ask you. Who exactly was it that told you that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's just... I mean, what else would they exist for?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The Cursed Beasts threaten our lives by simply existing! This whole world is has been ruined just because of their presence, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That is the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But consider this: the fact that we will be decimated by the Cursed Beasts does not necessarily mean that their purpose is to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>For example, humans cut down trees to make firewood, not for the sake of eliminating the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>From what I've observed, the Cursed Beasts accumulate the sin of people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The corruption of the people of each region, Lust in this region's case, is what feeds the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So the destruction of the regions is simply a kind of...side effect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Unless even that is just a part of some greater process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Anyway, the key point is that the Cursed Beasts accumulate sins and convert them into power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This is why normal attacks have little to no effect on the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The sin they accumulate is in one sense, a unique form of magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Asmodeus creates its shell by using this accumulated magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But no matter how highly condensed, magil is magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It does not explain why our powers, especially when using Matter, are negated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I said it was a unique form of magil, did I not? The magil that encases the Cursed Beast has special properties unlike those of regular magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That is the power of the seven deadly sins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Would that be the seven vices that exists within all people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Exactly. It is also what maintains the balance of the seven regions of this world, and so it is something we have no hope of facing on our own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Can we not? Through strong discipline, shouldn't we be able to resist the temptations of sin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So naive... Well, I don't dislike the way you think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But we must be realistic. We live in a world where temptation is all-powerful. You should all recognize that by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The Fallen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Right. They are those who have had their souls overwritten by the magil of their sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The essence of magil is without its own "color," therefore it is susceptible to conversion by more powerful colors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Those who possess strong magil may be able to retain some sense of self, but ultimately none can resist what alteration sin will wrought upon their very being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We witches use this malleability of magil to alter its state into, if you will, a desired color. Then we exert them upon the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The sins that Cursed Beasts envelope themselves in are stained to the core by the vices of humankind. Our shallow palate of magil simply gets repelled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh... I really don't get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>To put it simply, magil is like a piece of cloth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>When it's white, you can stain it different colors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>However, it is much more difficult to stain pieces of cloth already stained with a deep color.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>So the invulnerability of the Cursed Beasts comes from the fact they are already deeply stained in one color.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>If we cannot stain them into a different color, then we must bleach the color out of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>No matter how powerful their magil is, if it is colorless, then we can do as we wish with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>And that's what the Gears of Judgment do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yes. The magic rod Libra can peel away and seal the Lust that envelopes Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>In our last encounter, all I could do was peel away the outer layer of her shell, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Had I been able to reach the core, then I would have been able to undo the Cursed Beast's invulnerability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Then our powers would be able to affect Asmodeus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>In theory, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Let's just say it will, for morale's sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Well, we can't know until we try it. Everything is only theoretical at this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>We haven't yet seen if it is even possible to penetrate Asmodeus's shell! That is where we must start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>This method of challenging a Cursed Beast is somewhat haphazard to my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>This is how research is done. Hypothesis, followed by experimentation. Observe the resultsâ€”then formulate a new hypothesis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>If I already knew the answer to this issue, I would have never gotten myself into this situation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hrgh! My wound just opened up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What?! Nyx, get the first aid kit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yes, yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It is not fun growing old, I'll tell you what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I understand the theory you've devised to overcome the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>But as far as I could tell, the magic rod was powerful enough to damage the Cursed Beast, but not powerful enough to defeat it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Any theories as to why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Not even going to take a moment to comfort me about my age?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I don't think anybody really cares, Ambrosia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That's cold... Fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>To put it simply, there's not enough output.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>The limited magil available in this region just isn't enough to reach the core of that Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>There are ways to deal with that, but most of them would end with me bleeding out. I have no intention of dying that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I'm not sure I understand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>First of all, how do you charge that rod with the magil necessary for it to function?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>It's easier to just show you. Come with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'll show you my laboratory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Back when Agape was still a town of people, this mansion was home to the ruler of this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>As you have seen, this land is small, so there was no need to separate the judicial and executive branches of government.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>An underground dungeon for those found guilty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>And now it is my laboratory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Ugh, it's so gloomy down here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Why would you choose a place like this to work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>If that town isn't a town of people anymore, you could've chosen anywhere to work, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>It seemed to me to be a fitting place to conduct my research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>But the biggest reason I chose this place...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Th-this is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Insects? No... Are these corpses of the people of this region?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>That's not all. Look at what lies among the corpses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Some kind of...stone...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>In ancient times, the gods used magil to imbue stones with the cosmic principles of this world, and gifted them to the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>This is a replication of that ancient art, a crystallization of magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>The fuel source of the magic rod Libra. I assume you know what I'm trying to show you by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>You don't mean the rod is powered by...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I do. The rod functions by using the life force of those poor souls turned to bugs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>The magil drawn out from the bodies of these people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Cruel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Absolutely! Do you not value life?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Sadly, they have no other means of survival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Those who were in the town during the last attack should have noticed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Yes... The people, they were extremely sensitive to the cold. More so than we were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Exactly. Their bodies are not made to endure the harsh cold of this perpetual winter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>To survive here, something has to be burned for warmth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>So this magic rod Libra was originally a system designed to manage the magil of the town of Agape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>It accumulated the surplus magil, which you planned to use against the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Unfortunately, most of it was spent in the last fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Hmph! This town is an inversion of Paradise, the manifestation of Hell itself, built upon the sacrifice of their own kin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>It's a pathetic ship made of mud, on the brink of sinking if the birthrate ever dares to drop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>So this is the world of Lust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Yes. They are an ignorant flock, forced by Lust to march towards their doom, yet surviving thanks only to the grace of that same Lust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Still, I have to believe they have the right to live and survive if they will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>This complicates things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>To defeat Asmodeus, we'll have to remove the sin of Lust from it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>But if using the rod to do so would kill the people of the town...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Casualties... Sacrifices for the sake of the rest...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>(It's the same. The duty of the Vessel of Purification... I can't accept this. I won't accept this! I can't let people die like this!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Nimul...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I cannot let this lie. Now I have stronger conviction than ever to destroy Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>How do you expect to do so? It will cost a substantial amount of magil to peel sin away using Libra.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Especially from a Cursed Beast. That would cost the lives of the entire town. Are you prepared to make such a sacrifice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>There must be ways to work around that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Where do you think we're gonna find the resources to do that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>You don't mean the Matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I don't know if that is a wise decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>That orb you call Matter... The magil within it is indeed incredible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>But it was formed in the Gula Belt Region, was it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Magil stained in the color of Gluttony will not blend well with Libra's mechanism. We risk causing the  rod to malfunction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I don't think it will come to that. There's another way to extract the magil of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Magil is not exclusively found in organisms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>It is possible to extract them from inorganic material as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>You don't mean...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>I do. The reactor of the airship extracts magil from the atmosphere and converts it into fuel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>If we can link the rod to the airship's mechanism, we may be able to make full use of Libra's powers that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>What do you think, Adaleigh. Can you do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>I...think so. But I can't do it immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>I'd have to get back to the airship to repair and modify the reactor. I might need a specialist in magic to help me out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>So we're going retrieve the airship we left in the Cursed Beast's territory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I need to gather all the necessary supplies, and then some.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>We will also need to reexamine the rod from a magical perspective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Is that going to be a problem for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Not at all. Do what you must with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>None of you know the meaning of giving up, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>I would like to think so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Mira, Nyx, assist them with the rod in any way you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Thank you. All of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>You've got it backwards. You're the ones helping us out here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>But this leaves me concerned about the limits of what you are able to do at the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Those were some pretty bold claims you've been making.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>If you are truly able to do all that you say, it should be a small thing for you to overcome little old me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Winnick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Yes, ma'am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Come join me! We're all going to have a bit of fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Huh? Wait, what's going on?! Are you serious?!</td>
</tr>
