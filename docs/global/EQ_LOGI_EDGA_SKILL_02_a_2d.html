<td>Time for the grown-ups, huh? True. We can't afford to let them see what happens from here.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>They've only seen us fight against machines until now. It benefits no one to educate them in the ways that humans kill each other.</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>So? Why are you people living in a mountain of scrap metal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We're not living here! We're recycling the metal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Recycling? Why are the Alkaroids even moving? They should've been deactivated along with the Messiah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Messiah still isn't dead! It's pretty much a pile of scrap, but, if we could get our hands on an energy source...</td>

<td>007</td>
<td>I am telling you, you're wasting your time!</td>

<td>That idiot over there wasted the energy in my right hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Who are you calling an idiot? I'd prefer not to be demeaned by someone who gets abducted by scrap metal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I wasn't abducted! This is a mess that my former-henchmen caused, so I'm taking responsibility and settling it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's pretty much what I thought. Well, hurry up and take them out along with the scrap metal here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You don't have to tell me! But...</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Krchhhh... don't... move... Don... Taras... quietly... hand... over... the... energy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Tsk! Argh! It's scrap metal that keeps repeating the same thing, but it's just as powerful as before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Seriously. We've gotta fight that thing again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well, in any case, I missed out on my opportunity to take it out. This time...I'll beat it to a pulp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wait, Edgar! Even if you attack like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Krchhhh...!!!</td>
