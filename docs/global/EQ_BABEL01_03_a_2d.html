<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Have a safe trip! Isn't this amazing, though? To get a summons from the King himself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It is pretty big that our report was able to identify Wratharis as one of the parties involved in these incidents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yeah... Seems like things might get busy around here. Be careful out there, Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You, too. Hold down the fort for us. Let's go, Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They must be the Scarlet Legion, the ones who repelled the assassin! They seem quite reliable, do they not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmph. Despite already having the Blue Flame Guard, now we are in the hands of this disreputable lot. How embarrassing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It is thanks to them that we no longer fear a rogue blade lurking in the shadows. We ought to roll out the welcome wagon for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I suppose we could grant them the honor of tending to the therians' needs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Indeed. It was a waste to have our prestigious Blue Flame Guard handle the shepherding of those savages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>A fine job suited for these mercenary rabble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, well. We are simply...honored...to be here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Silence. Captain Vettel and Vice-Captain Gerald of the Scarlet Legion, on behalf of the people, we thank you for your efforts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Bringing light to the connection between Wratharis and the assassin is a worthy service to the country, indeed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The knowledge that this incident was tied to the recent incidents in the therian villages is also valuable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Information is power. We can leverage it to our advantage. "Know thine enemy" is the antithesis to the fear and insecurity of wondering what lies in the shadows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It is empowering to no longer be blinded by a lack of knowledge. War is not just about physical power, and you have given us the tools to prepare for what is to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We commend you for your contribution to this country and hold great expectations for what you will bring to our glorious Envylia in the future, no matter where your roots lie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We are not worthy of such high praise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>As proof of our trust in you, the Scarlet Legion, we ask you to go to the therian villages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There, you will be our first line of defense against Wratharis. Do not allow them to get away with whatever nefarious designs they may have upon our people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We shall also consider the possibility of officially recognizing the Scarlet Legion as its own knight order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We shall not disappoint you, sir! Thank you for this opportunity!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wonderful. You are a boon to all of us here in Envylia. Thank you, Scarlet Legion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's incredible that we might have the chance to become a proper knight order! My head is spinning. This is beyond anything I could have expected!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What? Pull yourself together. It doesn't matter if we're a knight order or not. The only thing we should concern ourselves with is staying true to what we believe in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You say that, but thanks to your instincts, you were able to save the noble, and the Scarlet Legion can take this unprecedented step forward. Well done, Gerald.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's a bit early to be passing congratulations around. Hmph. You go on ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Okay. Be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey. I know you're there, and it's driving me nuts. Come out now so we can settle this like men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>To try to kill me like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Tch. This is a cowardly way to try to get back at me, you chatty assassin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hahaha! What's wrong with it? Weren't you bored without me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What am I...? Well! Fine words for someone who got me fired! I quite liked my job, too. I expect you to take responsibility for this unfortunate situation I find myself in, since it's your fault and all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Responsibility...? No, wait... You can't be serious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What's with that? You're the one who invited me to join you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You...? No. No way. Do you really understand what you're getting yourself into?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>How shocking, Sir Gerald! That's sounds more like something that I should be asking you, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I mean... Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Well, anyway. I brought a gift for the occasion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Gift...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I did a little...ahem...snooping around my contacts, and I might've pissed a few people off, but...there's some information you might be interested in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Heh. Good, right? I know. You don't have to say it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hmph. Not bad. So, what did you find out about your client?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Sadly, not so much, except that they are almost certainly from Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Whew! Glad that's all off my chest. You know, information like that doesn't come cheap in this industry! Getting that bit of information was like pulling teeth from a four-year-old.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I see... I don't know anything about that, but just knowing the Wratharis connection is like hitting the jackpot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Tsk! Did I say that was all? Did I? No. Listen to me when I'm talking, will you? After all, I'm sure it's important to you that they've decided to contract a different assassin after all that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>A different assassin...? They're planning to send someone else to complete your mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hm... Dunno if there's anyone else of my caliber to do what I do. I mean... Unless they get the Leonharts to come in from Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Leonharts...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I mean, you didn't think my people were the only ones out there, right? There's us, and there's the Leonharts. Honestly, I'm curious what would happen if we were pit against one another...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ahem, not that it seems likely to happen. I haven't heard anything about the Leonharts working with Wratharis. I'm just saying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Then...you're saying we don't need to worry about them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Well, it's better to be prepared than to be caught with our pants down. After all, it sounds like Wratharis is preparing to send reinforcements to the therian villages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>For the Alchemia Particles contained within the therians?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What?! How did you know?! Aw man, I guess this news wasn't as juicy as I thought it was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Apparently they're planning to use those Alchemia Particles to craft a Philosopher's Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Philosopher's Stone...? Alchemy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Oh, you don't know that bit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>This is way bigger than I could have imagined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Hey. Hey! Helloooo? This is just a thought, but maybe we should start heading over to the therian village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Right... The therians.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What's with that face, Sir Gerald? What are you gonna do if your face gets stuck that way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>In Envylia, there aren't a lot of people who are particularly interested in the safety of the therians. It explains why that's fallen to the Scarlet Legion...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Huh! Interesting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>We share the same space, but there's not much effort on either side in terms of cross-cultural understanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Sir...Gerald?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>It's nothing. Thank you for the information. It has been extremely helpful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Oh, good. I'm glad to hear my efforts were not wasted. Honestly, it's shameful how people under duress will just go ahead and tell you whatever you want to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Duress...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Whoops! That's just my world, man. Did I mention I was an assassin? This kind of thing is pretty on par.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You... Just... Ugh. In any case, I suppose we'd better make our way over to the therian village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Thank you for coming to us, Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Nah. You all just happen to be more interesting than anything else going on. Nothing to thank me for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I see. Then did you have new information for us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Eh, just rumors that someone in Wratharis is planning to use the Alchemia harvested from the therians to make a Philosopher's Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Just—?! Finding out about the Alchemia Particles was bad enough, but a Philosopher's Stone...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Are they really planning to defy the Magna Code and resort to using alchemy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>That's ridiculous... The Holy Guard would never let that slide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>We need to figure out what their true intentions are. We're almost at the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Um...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>A...therian child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Please don't be afraid. I am Vettel, Captain of the Scarlet Legion. We have come because we heard that the therian village was under attack again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Would it be possible for you to take us to your leader?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Gerald...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Fine... Just be sure to lead the way properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>U-um... Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Hoh... So Wratharis is planning to attack our village again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>And this time, you come not as a representative of the Holy Guard, but as leader of some mercenary band.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Yes. We would be much obliged if you would allow us to stay and protect this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Leave this place at once. Last time, we allowed you here because you were a knight of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>"Therians and humans, separate but equal." That is the code we live by. If it comes down to being protected by ruffians like you or defending ourselves with our own hands, we would prefer the latter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>How can you say that?! We're just here to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Who knows what would have happened last time if Vettel and the Scarlet Legion hadn't been around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Whatever happened last time, that was against our explicit wishes. We asked for none of this. We are not a people to be protected. We are capable of handling this ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>We have done so multiple times before. My people have weathered natural disasters and human-made disasters on our own until now. What need have we of you now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>How long do you plan to protest? We are aware that many humans don't care if we live or die. They would prefer we were wiped off the face of the planet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>We don't mind. In fact, we share similar sentiments. Why bother to protect us? What do you lose by withdrawing as we ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>We are therians. Our lives are defined by the "kill or be killed" creed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Nngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Gerald, your head is sparking like crazy... Are you okay? Do you need any medicine or anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>You therians are always saying the same thing! Always the same excuses!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Gerald...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>There was once a proud man willing to put his life on the line for therians.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>As a result, his life was taken prematurely. He died to protect therians!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Just so we can stand here now, listening to some therians spout the same crap that the nobles did about "kill or be killed!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>So what? You're saying my father deserved to be killed because he was weak? I refuse to acknowledge that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Gerald, calm down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Never mind... We will protect you because that is the mission we have been given.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>That is what he taught me. That is what we have sworn to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Ahem, uh... So, sorry to interrupt, but there's kind of an army out there. Are we going to do something about that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Of course. The honor of the Scarlet Legion is on the line. We will go forth to meet the enemy as we promised.</td>
</tr>
