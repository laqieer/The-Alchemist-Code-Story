<td>006</td>
<td>I've determined Captain Zeke's hidden motives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I know this will be hard to believe, but it appears he is eyeing to overthrow the king of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I could hardly believe it myself, but the truth was thrust upon me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wh-what happened?! Explain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>After you left, I began to question Captain Zeke again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I asked him for what reason he sought to make peace now. In response, Captain Zeke drew his sword against me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My father drew his sword...?! I can't believe it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It appears he wasn't motivated by the guilt of having slaughtered the people of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>At the center of everything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...Was his tremendous ambition to use Agatha as a shield in starting a revolution while acting under the pretense of promoting peace!</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Are you sure...?! My father admitted to that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Time has changed Captain Zeke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We often had conflicting views, but I respected him as my comrade in our support of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>It's extremely regrettable. The old hero of Envylia seems to no longer exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Father...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Having become aware of this, I can no longer allow Captain Zeke to come face to face with the King.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We must hurry to the gates of Castle Valderik. There, we should find Agatha as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Father! Have you abandoned your honor and pride as a knight of justice?!</td>
