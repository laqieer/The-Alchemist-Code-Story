<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh! You awake? Here, drink this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The food is almost ready. Don't worry it's not poisoned or anything. Have a sip and be patient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>…!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>…What's your angle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Nothing really… You shouldn't make any sudden movements after what happened earlier. You must be tired. It was no easy task carrying you all the way here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…! What's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Er, never mind. It must have been my imagination. I'm sure that's what it was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Anyway… what's with that line you said earlier--the you-wouldn't-have-to-die-if-you-just-left-me-alone line?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Embarrassed? Maybe you should try not fainting next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…!!!</td>

<tr>

<td>Shut up! Shut up, shut up, shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Well, just take it easy for now…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Stay back!… Filthy human!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hang on! Just calm down, will ya? I'm no match for you if you start rampaging again. Let's just calm down and talk it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Perfect! Just like that! Take a deep breath and exhale. Now breathe in again and...breathe out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Heh heh! Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Why did you bring me here? Humans and demons...are supposed to be enemies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yeah, well...I'm not surprised you think that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What do you plan to do to me? I'm not so weak that I'll submit to the likes of you…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah-ah-ah! Aren't you hungry? I told you not to move so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I…will never forgive your kind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'll never forget what you did to us…for as long as I live!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>…Is that right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Go to hell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oof…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I told you, stop moving around! I don't want to have to carry you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Stop implying that I’m heavy! And don't touch me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>..!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>…I bet you've had a rough life, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…What would you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Just a hunch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>My brother and I... We promised we'd kill all humans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Okay then. How about you devour me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I won't let you devour all of me, but at least enough to satisfy your hunger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If that will make you feel better-even just a little bit--why not take a bite?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Go on. What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>…!!!</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>STAY BACK!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>…I'll kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What's so funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Now I feel like I've got to make you eat me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Drop dead!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>…!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'll have you know, I know how to handle a kitchen knife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Tch…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Relax. Just take a seat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Be quiet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Sit down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>…!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I won't ask you to forgive us, but if there's one thing I can do…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It's to apologize and give you something to eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>…What is it with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I told you. I'm Koga.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hey, are you alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>…Stay back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You're too hungry to move, aren't you? You've got no choice but to eat or you'll die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What about that promise you made with your brother? You can't let this opportunity go to waste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Hang on a sec. I'm going to add a little more seasoning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>….If you still plan on killing me, then…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>At least eat what I've prepared for you first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>…Anybody home? Helloooo?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>…You think I'd believe a word a human says? I know you're just trying to butter me up so that I'll let my guard down…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>…And then you'll take whatever you can. That's the human way… Well, I won't let you take any more from me!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Huh? Are you…Are you gonna do that "rampage" thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Come on... Not inside, okay? This is my house--it's not the same as outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>*ROAR*</td>
