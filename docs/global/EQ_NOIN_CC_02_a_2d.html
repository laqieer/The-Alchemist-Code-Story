<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I thought of the sky as I walked in my dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I looked up at an unseen sky, always wanting freedom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>My days were filled with pain, cruelty, and shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>When I got knocked down and all I would see is a disgusting world with disgusting people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I would close my eyes and cover my ears to drown out those sights and sounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>They say that curiosity killed the cat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If I were allowed to choose, I would have preferred curiosity to be what killed me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Plundering within the boundaries of the rules. Nothin' could be more fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Are you...going to kill me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Food? For me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There was a huge stockpile. Your owners were making a killing back there, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Am I allowed to have so much? And all this water...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I've had my fill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Why did you save me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I didn't. I looted you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Looted...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm not stupid. I heard you the first time. We're in...Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You still don't know anything, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>They made me study. Enough so I wouldn't be a burden if I was ever sold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But they rarely let me go outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This place is a cesspool full of punks like them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The more you know of this place, the less you would care to be "outside."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Cesspool...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Where they keep the poop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, yeah. I knew that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Poop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I know! I do it, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Y-you don't?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The country of apathy, Slothstein. Under its streets is a giant hollow that supposedly doesn't exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Criminals on the run, orphans of war, and anybody else without a home...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Who knows when it started, but this place became a commune for those whose places in this world were taken from them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>At some point, it was coined as Lost Blue, the sunken city light doesn't reach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The last resort for those who have nowhere else to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Therian Care Center, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I-I want to leave this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Sorry, but a job's a job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>A...mercenary...job?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Scoundrels and villains aren't the only ones who populate Lost Blue, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Some people were chased out of their countries for having frighteningly exceptional talent. Scholars, mages, political prisoners... Even former leaders of nations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The doctor I always go to was something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You get sick, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>No, just something for muscle pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>For muscle pain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Let me tell you something about muscles. You gotta repair them after working out, with proper rest and nutrition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>For starters, there are slow muscles and fast muscles. These need two different training methods to develop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Either way, they both need ample rest afterwards, and nutrition to repair any damages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It's just that nutrition is scarce down here, so I have to use supplements to give them what they need. Another thing about muscles—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That's...enough about muscles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Muscles will never betray you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Uh-huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Unfortunately, muscles alone won't get you steady pay to survive down here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Finally, you're back on topic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Greed Dike takes an interest in people like us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Some of us in Lost Blue take secret jobs from Greed Dike in exchange for food and money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Secret...jobs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Dirty jobs. Mercenaries like me are valued, and so are "researchers" like your former owners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>This place is perfect if you wanted to conduct experiments that require inhumane methods society would never tolerate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>A nice little hide-out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That "Therian Care Center" was opened with Greed Dike's aid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'm guessing they wanted to find a way to exploit therians for their military.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>That's...not how it was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>They called them experiments...but we were basically slaves, and when they got bored or needed money, they would sell us off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>All of my friends were slaves and received harsh treatment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Even I was... Almost every day, they—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That's probably why I got this job. That place just became nothing more than a liability for a country to be invested in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Not to mention, the controlled transformation of therians into a beast form, which that place was studying...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Greed Dike probably figured it was too much for them to handle. They don't want a military asset going berserk on them one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>That's just how things are. Those with too much are cast away, just like those who are wanting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>They'll eventually find some new thing to experiment on until they dump that out into Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Am I going to be thrown away, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What do you think bastards like me do when we're not happy with a low-paying job?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Uh... Negotiate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>That...actually didn't cross my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>We embezzle what we can. We take some of the loot for ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Is that what I am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You're one of the last successful specimens of beast transformation. Even a major country would be threatened by loot like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I went around and checked, but there don't seem to be any other therians in the facility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I just have to report that all of the specimens have been destroyed, while keeping you to myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I get to choose whether you live or die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You're a monster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Say what you will. Anything goes, when it comes to survival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Heh. We barely set foot outside of the facility, and look at what we find. Darn buzzards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Hey, Dead Nine... What you got there? You don't mind sharin' do ya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I got a huge tab to pay off. Come on. Spare me some money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Go make your own money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What's with the little girlie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Nn?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Hehehehehehe... A girl? She's just my type!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Hey, little missy. Come with me! Let's go somewhere nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>She's not interested in going with someone as ugly as you! She's obviously interested in me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>That's what you said about the last girl, and look what happened! Haven't seen her since! Hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Bahahahaha! All of you can stand back. Lady, I promise to be nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Oi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>You no longer have a collar on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>If you can handle this world—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Why are we arguing? Just kill Dead Nine and take her, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>That's not a bad idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Power is everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Power is...everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>You won't lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Dead Nine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>If you can handle this world... If you are willing to survive here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Then your life is in my hands, but it's your choice to walk out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>A life of fighting ain't that bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Ngh! Wh-what is going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I could do with another round... Let's go play with them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I don't need help. Stay out of my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Oh, really? Heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I'm not some pet. Not anymore.</td>
