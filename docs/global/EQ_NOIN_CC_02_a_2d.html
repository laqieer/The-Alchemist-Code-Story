<td>They say that curiosity killed the cat.</td>

<td>Are you...going to kill me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Food? For me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>There was a huge stockpile. Your owners were making a killing back there, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Am I allowed to have so much? And all this water...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>I've had my fill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Why did you save me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>I didn't. I looted you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Looted...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>I'm not stupid. I heard you the first time. We're in...Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>You still don't know anything, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>They made me study. Enough so I wouldn't be a burden if I was ever sold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>But they rarely let me go outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>This place is a cesspool full of punks like them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>The more you know of this place, the less you would care to be "outside."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Cesspool...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Where they keep the poop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Well, yeah. I knew that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Poop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Criminals on the run, orphans of war, and anybody else without a home...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Who knows when it started, but this place became a commune for those whose places in this world were taken from them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>At some point, it was coined as Lost Blue, the sunken city light doesn't reach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>The last resort for those who have nowhere else to go.</td>

<td>Therian Care Center, eh?</td>

<tr>

<td>I-I want to leave this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Sorry, but a job's a job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>A...mercenary...job?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Scoundrels and villains aren't the only ones who populate Lost Blue, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Some people were chased out of their countries for having frighteningly exceptional talent. Scholars, mages, political prisoners... Even former leaders of nations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>The doctor I always go to was something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>You get sick, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>No, just something for muscle pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>For muscle pain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Let me tell you something about muscles. You gotta repair them after working out, with proper rest and nutrition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>For starters, there are slow muscles and fast muscles. These need two different training methods to develop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Either way, they both need ample rest afterwards, and nutrition to repair any damages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>It's just that nutrition is scarce down here, so I have to use supplements to give them what they need. Another thing about muscles—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>That's...enough about muscles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Muscles will never betray you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Uh-huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Unfortunately, muscles alone won't get you steady pay to survive down here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Finally, you're back on topic.</td>

<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Some of us in Lost Blue take secret jobs from Greed Dike in exchange for food and money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Secret...jobs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Dirty jobs. Mercenaries like me are valued, and so are "researchers" like your former owners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><img src="../img/backgrounds/bg83.png" alt="bg83"></td></tr>
<tr>

<td>This place is perfect if you wanted to conduct experiments that require inhumane methods society would never tolerate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>A nice little hide-out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>That "Therian Care Center" was opened with Greed Dike's aid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>I'm guessing they wanted to find a way to exploit therians for their military.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>That's...not how it was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>They called them experiments...but we were basically slaves, and when they got bored or needed money, they would sell us off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>All of my friends were slaves and received harsh treatment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Even I was... Almost every day, they—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>That's probably why I got this job. That place just became nothing more than a liability for a country to be invested in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Not to mention, the controlled transformation of therians into a beast form, which that place was studying...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Greed Dike probably figured it was too much for them to handle. They don't want a military asset going berserk on them one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>That's just how things are. Those with too much are cast away, just like those who are wanting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>They'll eventually find some new thing to experiment on until they dump that out into Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>What do you think bastards like me do when we're not happy with a low-paying job?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Uh... Negotiate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>That...actually didn't cross my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>We embezzle what we can. We take some of the loot for ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Is that what I am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>You're one of the last successful specimens of beast transformation. Even a major country would be threatened by loot like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>I went around and checked, but there don't seem to be any other therians in the facility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>I just have to report that all of the specimens have been destroyed, while keeping you to myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>I get to choose whether you live or die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>You're a monster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Say what you will. Anything goes, when it comes to survival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Heh. We barely set foot outside of the facility, and look at what we find. Darn buzzards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rogue A</td>
<td>Hey, Dead Nine... What you got there? You don't mind sharin' do ya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I got a huge tab to pay off. Come on. Spare me some money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Go make your own money.</td>

</tr>

<td>Nn?!</td>

<td>Hehehehehehe... A girl? She's just my type!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rogue E</td>
<td>Hey, little missy. Come with me! Let's go somewhere nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rogue F</td>
<td>She's not interested in going with someone as ugly as you! She's obviously interested in me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rogue E</td>
<td>That's what you said about the last girl, and look what happened! Haven't seen her since! Hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rogue G</td>
<td>Bahahahaha! All of you can stand back. Lady, I promise to be nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Oi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You no longer have a collar on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>If you can handle this world—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rogue A</td>
<td>Why are we arguing? Just kill Dead Nine and take her, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rogue B</td>
<td>That's not a bad idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Power is everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Power is...everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>You won't lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Dead Nine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>If you can handle this world... If you are willing to survive here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Then your life is in my hands, but it's your choice to walk out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>A life of fighting ain't that bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rogue C</td>
<td>Ngh! Wh-what is going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>I could do with another round... Let's go play with them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>I don't need help. Stay out of my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Oh, really? Heh...</td>
