<td>Using alchemy to purify appears to be more effective than I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(Yet it's still not as effective as Spiritbonding. In that case, I'll have to make up for it somehow...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ah! Damn—</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>"The source of compassion sways as gently as the Mother's rocking cradle..."</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What... This technique... Spiritbonding?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Gosh, you're as reckless as ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I can't take my eyes off of you, not even for a second.</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Malta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Why? But you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You used Beelzebub, didn't you? That's probably why.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Beelzebub is the antithesis of Sephiron. Awakening it brought the remnants of me, a druidic priestess, back to this land temporarily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Malta, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's okay. You don't have to say anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You're going away, aren't you? The longest journey you'll ever take.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But I see... This time you came to report to me, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Then I forgive you! After all, what kind of big sis doesn't appreciate that sentiment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Don't you mean "I'm off"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Travel as much as you want, learn all the things I don't know, and bring back a lot of souvenirs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm sure it won't be me who greets you, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Still, this is your home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yeah, I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Very good! Well, then... Goodbye, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I wish you the best on your journey. Safe travels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I can't think of a better send-off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'll go with you. To see the future of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yeah. I'll join you on your journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's reassuring. Thank you, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No, thank you. You're not the only one benefiting from this arrangement. Don't worry about it. Oh, by the way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If you want to leave the kingdom, you'd better take the sea route. The Fruit Peddlers have a ship docked at the port right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Times change in the blink of an eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The past, not allowed to remain in place, is dredged up and swept away in the great river of time. And yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...the vow we made that day is still in my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Even if the proper succession is cut off, everything is connected to tomorrow.</td>
