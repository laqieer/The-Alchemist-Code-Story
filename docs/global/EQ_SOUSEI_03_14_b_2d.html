</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The path is clear! Go on, Adaleigh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Here I go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Just a little...further!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh?! It used the earth as a wall to block me! Damn it! I was so close!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ngh... "In the name of the Gate of Gluttony, I shatter the wind!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>After all this, a stalemate?! We can't even get close to Belphegor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We can't fail now! There must be a way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Damn! Adaleigh, get out of the way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wha...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Am...I...alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wait, father? Adaleigh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ugh... This smoke... Is anyone out there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Gah... Min...ario...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Father?! You're still... No. I can't call that body of yours alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Where did everyone go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That monitor is still working. Maybe it'll show you something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>A-Adaleigh! They're fighting the Cursed Beast?! They're really doing it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But they're struggling! There has to be something I can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Minario... Do you...think...I was wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Who cares about that right now?! This region—your people—are on the brink of obliteration!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If we stop and point fingers at a time like this, neither one of us is fit to tell anybody else what to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You...might be...right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But I can't...even move...anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I can see that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So...it's up to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What? What are you expecting me to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>One floor down...from here... There's an emergency control system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If you succeed...you might be able to slow Belphegor down...for a while, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Seriously?! But I'm no good with machinery. I'm not an Engineer, not like Adaleigh or you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So you'll...give up without even trying? Is that...your idea of...taking responsibility?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>All right... I get it! I'll go, obviously! You just hold tight, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>There...you go... That's...my son.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmmm? Did Belphegor just stop moving?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes! Did I do it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Is that Minario I hear?! You're alive?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What, you assumed I was dead?! I can't believe you guys just left me behind! You've got a lot to answer for...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm really sorry, Minario...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm using the clocktower's backup generator to reconstruct the magil belt used to restrict Belphegor's motion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This should hold him in place for a little while!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Grrroooaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ack... It's on the move again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>No! How can Belphegor have so much strength left?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>This isn't good! It took aim at the clocktower responsible for its restriction!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Whoaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Warning. The outer wall of the clocktower has been breached by magil, heavily affecting navigation. Disengagement is recommended to maintain safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Are you kidding?! I can't retreat now, not after all this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Minario?! Is everything all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I've got this! I'll power my way though it! So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>If you've got anything up your sleeve, this is the time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hear me, Adaleigh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Loud and clear! I won't let this chance you've bought me go to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Graaaaaaaaaaooooh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Full steam ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Libra's terminal has penetrated Belphegor's core!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Belphegor's magil is losing its potency and thinning out! This is our chance, Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Go on, Adaleigh! Get out of there! I'm going to finish this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Uh oh! Okay, got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>"My corporeal form shall be the key! My ego shall reach the great plains, and overturn the cosmic principles!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Take all of my magil, and dispel the slumbering Sloth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Did we...do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Not yet! Remember what happened in the Luxuria Belt Region?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast's core... Is it belching out corruption?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>This time we need to work together, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>What...happened? Is this the result of the backlash from packing that attack with such power...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Wait... Emmel! You can't do this again...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You know me too well, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>There are so many people living here in this region. I can't let even one of them be drowned in the corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>But if you do it, you'll just be repeating history!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Don't worry, Nimul. This is my destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>No! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>"The kingdom shall inherit the crown, and the heavenly gates shall open for the souls of the pure. Save us, heal us, spare us!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>"Sephiron, our great Mother, the Tree of Life, crowned supreme; we who pass into temptation, beyond the tertium sephirah, beyond the crossroads."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>"Save us, the lost souls!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>To deny the second sin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>To deny the sin of Sloth is to deny peace, seed of compassion. You deny the resting souls their time in their cradle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Thus does your body need no rest. Thus need you not lay yourself down to sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Yes. For to forfeit sin is to forfeit existence itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Is it your choice, then, to shed your humanity to become a vessel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Sorry... I'm at my limit! The clocktower! It's falling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>What?! Nimul! Hurry and get Emmel...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I know—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You lot continue to surprise me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>It is impressive that you could best a Cursed Beast in a region so full of people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>However, if I want to save this world, I cannot allow you to run free any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Hey! Let go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>The clocktower...?! Nimul, step aside! If this keeps up, the ground will crumble beneath our feet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Wait! Emmel...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I will be taking this young lady. If you wish to retrieve her... Well, then you will have to come and get her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Your journey will end in the Gula Belt Region where it began.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>No... Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Nimul! Are you all right?! Open your eyes! Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Wake him later! The ground is caving in! We have to get back to the airship!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Uh oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>What the heck?! Just what is going on here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>He returns... Our king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Then I must hurry and complete the role assigned to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You know what that means, don't you, Eulalia?</td>
