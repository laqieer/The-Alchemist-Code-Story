<td>Ghah...!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What?! Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, how the star has fallen. I can't believe you've stooped so low as to guard a man marked for death! You bring disgrace upon Zalam Gaim.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The client is dead, and the mission has been retracted. This man is no longer a target. You will stand down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Our creed forbids the execution of any target after the mission has been canceled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I know what our creed forbids. But this man's life happens to be worth a pretty penny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Even if the original client is dead, there are many others who also wish for the Desert Wings' guild captain to meet his demise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>And despite your failure, Najam, there are many other assassins ready and willing to execute this mission on my word alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You poor souls...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Go! Take the guild captain down, now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Whosoever succeeds where Najam has failed will have her rank bestowed upon them in my new order of Zalam Gaim!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is absurd. Don't you all have other missions to attend to? What of them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Looks like Zalam Gaim's a much more fragile organization than I even realized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So it would seem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(Ryle was right. At this rate, our assassins will continue making attempts at his life until they finally execute him...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(And Zalam Gaim will completely lose its identity when people start to realize a swift death can be sold to the highest bidder.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You really okay with this? Helping me means betraying your order, you know. I don't think there's any coming back from this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this because...Zalam Gaim is the only home I have. And I intend to save it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'll show Zalam Gaim just how bright its star can burn!</td>
