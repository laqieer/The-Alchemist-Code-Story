<td>Dahab</td>
<td>Oh, how the star has fallen. I can't believe you've stooped so low as to guard a man marked for death! You bring disgrace upon Zalam Gaim.</td>

<td>I know what our creed forbids. But this man's life happens to be worth a pretty penny.</td>

<tr>
<td>Dahab</td>
<td>Even if the original client is dead, there are many others who also wish for the Desert Wings' guild captain to meet his demise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dahab</td>
<td>And despite your failure, Najam, there are many other assassins ready and willing to execute this mission on my word alone.</td>

<td>Whosoever succeeds where Najam has failed will have her rank bestowed upon them in my new order of Zalam Gaim!</td>

<td>This is absurd. Don't you all have other missions to attend to? What of them?!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>
<td>(And Zalam Gaim will completely lose its identity when people start to realize a swift death can be sold to the highest bidder.)</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>
<td>I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this because...Zalam Gaim is the only home I have. And I intend to save it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/asuw.png" alt="Aswald" height="128"><br>Aswald</td>
