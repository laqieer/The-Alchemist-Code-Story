<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>W-wow! You just took those Greed Dike soldiers out with one blow! Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It doesn't matter. More importantly...how can you be sure those aren't the words of the king?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You said they are making the king say those words, right? What proof do you have of that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I am currently serving by the king's side in order to protect him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yeah...I heard from Dilga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The king was the kind of person who would make conversation with me even when was I still an apprentice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Even to the likes of me he would say, 'Always try to live up to your title as a knight.'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>He meant that peace is not always brought about by force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>When people come together...and use their power to protect that bond...peace becomes a possibility for the first time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Greed Dike's military strength will bring about peace in this country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The king I know would never say something like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ah! I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Honestly. I'm completely amazed by your actions...although you did complicate matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh? Argh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ug...ughhh! Ba...Basheeny...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You better not move. I can pierce him this very moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Emperor Orion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It was quite a hassle...but I managed to apprehend the Holy Guard's Captain Monzein of the 2nd Regiment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's been a while, Lord Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Captain Monzein the Great Thunder Axe...who would've thought I would run into you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Monzein...?! You?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Tsk! What're you playing at?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It should be pretty obvious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Unfortunately...I do not plan on being annihilated alongside you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Wait, did you betray us again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What is going on? Didn't you turn on us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Turn on you? Heheh. Did I manage to deceive you as well Lord Waginau? That is the highest honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I have gained access to all the captains of the Holy Guard beginning with the Lord Commander himself. I am now in a position to lure them to wherever you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You brat...there'll be no forgiveness for you now!!! Huzzaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oops! Honestly, your actions are completely futile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>This is why you're always being used as a pawn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>As a pawn...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Don't you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Because of your brash personality, people take advantage of you...both your enemies and your friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You're wasting my time. At least put on a good show.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Lord Waginau, reinforcements will soon arrive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It would be best to handle this man before they arrive. It can be troublesome if they were to rendezvous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Reinforcements? Well...there's no need for us to reveal our hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Are you sure you're not betraying us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That's exactly what I am telling you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>They were truly a bunch of honest fools. It hardly took much effort to infiltrate their ranks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You scum...!!! Lightning Axe!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hmph. Where are you even aiming at? Honestly...his rage has made him go crazy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...! Please escape! The stairway is going to collapse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...Good job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Agh...! Y-you...Basheeny!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>My apologies...but let me correct what I just said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I did not turn on you. Instead, I found something to believe in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hmph. Honestly, kid...using me as a pawn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'm sorry. That was the only move I could think of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I didn't come all the way here to choose the path of complete annihilation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Tighten the defenses. They're after the King of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Are you sure about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Ack...?! Why me...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>There's no point in playing dumb. Ever since I heard that the king was being controlled, I've been searching my surroundings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You were the only one, weren't you? When the king was talking, you had your eyes facing downward with your head bowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Wh-what about that...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Moreover, you were murmuring something with your lips. They were the king's words, weren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'm not that easily deceived. After all, I was pretty much forced to learn how to resist theÂ Phantom Arts when I served under Lord Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Ack!!! I-I heard nothing about there being another who knew the arts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Huh?! He disappeared?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Furthermore, you definitely didn't say anything about him being such a cute young man. Aren't these things you should be informing me of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>A girl?! Ack...! You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Unfortunately...I'm no longer there. I am one of the Veda Templars...Vier, wielder of the Phantom Scent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Young man...are you a little more interested now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>The Veda Templars?! Wh-what are they?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Hehe. Women are mysterious creatures. You must suppress your desire to know everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Oh no...we're surrounded!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Ack! Lightning Axe!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Run! Let's regroup...this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>G-got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Run...? Aren't you talking about yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Heheh. So you're using a countermeasure for the Phantom Arts. I wonder if your little countermeasure can work against my craft?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Wh-what the...my arm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Captain Monzein!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Is he being manipulated by the Phantom Arts?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Heheh. Even the world-renowned Monzein cannot do much against an attack he can't see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>It appears so. Vier...take out Basheeny. It'll be troublesome if we leave him be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hmph. Can you stop making me do everything? Just use your own soldiers that you're so proud of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You cheeky little... Immortals, advance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>There are so many immortal soldiers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Agh! R-run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>My...my body...! Ack! Captain! Fall back immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Reinforcements will arrive soon. You must do whatever you can to rendezvous with Captain Yauras!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>By doing so...it'll give the king a chance to recapture the country!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Tsk...! What about you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Don't worry about me! This is my "atonement." I have already made my decision!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Atonement?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>My atonement for having underestimated that woman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>More importantly...this is my atonement to myself for my actions against the Holy Guard in the past...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Ever since I decided to join Commander Kanon...I've prepared myself for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Basheeny...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Do it!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Come on. Hurry up and go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Ack! Don't be stupid! I can't leave my men to die...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Honestly. You're so stubborn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Perfect. Let me use this final opportunity to tell you this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I hate you...you're an emotional, stubborn piece of work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Haha. You should at least try and fix that blockheaded nature of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>...Goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Ack...! Huzzzaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>What the...?! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>...That's odd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I hate you as well. Do you think I'd actually follow your instructions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Don't be stupid! No...! Stay back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Get them!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Ack! You little brat! Take this! Grit your teeth, Basheeny!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>?! Agh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>All right...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Ughh...!!! Ack...ckk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Captain!!!</td>
