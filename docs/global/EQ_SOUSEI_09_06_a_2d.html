<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I cannot believe you all would jump to fight me without even a single moment's hesitation! Do you all hate me so much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Says the one who attacked first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I suppose you've got me there. But things just got a little out of hand! It was an honest mistake. I just had a lot on my shoulders, that's all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But are you sure you should be wasting your time with me, knight of the Ire Belt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I outright admitted I'm here to buy some time, no? Aren't you the least bit concerned about your fearless leader?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Silence! We will capture you here, and we will pry the answers we seek from you by force if we have to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hold on. I don't think we need to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What was that?! This is no ordinary flow of magil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Holy—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A tower...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ah, the keystone of the Ceremony of Creation—the final trial for you humans to overcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The stage is set for the ultimate battlefield, whereupon we can fight unimpeded by the Light of Judgment from the Shell of the World.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Battlefield?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The crystallization of all that the dragons once sought to achieve, built up using the seven pillars as its core...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Under its protection, a human could even stand against a god without being crushed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That, travelers, is the only thing that will allow humans such as yourselves to face Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That said, it can't last particularly long, as you might imagine. There's not enough magil to sustain it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Did you decide to show mercy, Bianca? Ha! Perhaps she has allowed her heart a bit too much leeway with humanity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So that battlefield is your goal, then?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It is. Perhaps you should all sheathe your swords and take a proper look up at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Can you not see the light of battle gleaming at the top? The dragon warriors, the serpents, that would consume this world are engaged in mortal combat with one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Curses!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That was a bad move, I'm afraid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I can't...keep up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmph. You're clearly not meant to fly solo on the battlefield, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's a bit of a shame, as you have considerable power at your fingertips, but won't have much opportunity to use it without allies watching your back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>How unfortunate for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(Is this the end?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That...light...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Time to rest. I'll make this as painless as possible for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huzzzaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>A Cursed Dragon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well, now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Lucifer?! Why—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Retreat, human child. I will remain to fight in your stead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(Lucifer, the Cursed Beast... It spoke to me?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I am only fulfilling my end of the contract I made with that girl. I will protect you, as promised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That girl? You mean, Emmel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>There is no prospect of victory for you on this battlefield. Flee, human child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>So, you yet live, last of the Cursed Dragons. The humans did not destroy you after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Used the cores absorbed by the tower to create your own Shell, did you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Stained by human sin, consumed by their corruption, and yet now you fight on their behalf, Lucifer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Cursed Dragon, Ophioneus. It seems at least your ego has survived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Only that. I am Lucifer now. The age of the dragons is over. Now all that remains is a beast, and that beast has chosen to side with the humans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Grrrroooooaaaar!!!</td>
