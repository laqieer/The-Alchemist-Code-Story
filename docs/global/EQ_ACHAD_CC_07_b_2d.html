<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Now you will talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oho! Will I, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why did you save me from the final battlefield?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Then how do you explain the claw marks I found on my skin? They were unmistakably yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Nonsense! You must be mistaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Then why were you waiting for me here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You could've taken Veda's power for yourself well before I arrived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What can I say? I'm a gentleman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What did you mean by what you said that day? "Your poor, oppressed little soul was just yearning to be unleashed!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>"Follow me, Amu!" "Aren't we both the villains of this play?" "Remember our first encounter? Did it not feel like destiny? It did to me!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Are you quoting little old me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>All this time, you've just been projecting your emotions onto me! You're the one who's suppressing what he really feels!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>"You do love your fellow Templars, don't you?" "Then die in their arms!" "If you love them so much, then why aren't you prepared to die by their hands?!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>All because you didn't die with your mother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You couldn't accept your mother's death! You couldn't accept that you still loved her, despite everything she put you through! You couldn't accept what you did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Shut up! Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's why you've been seeking out the most dramatic death imaginable! All so you can finally please your mother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't talk to me about my mama!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Even so, you were still afraid of dying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Say what you like, but you and I are the same! Neither of us has anyone left! We're all alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Take my hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You might have taken my eye, but I can still see just fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That mark on your left eye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Bionic Eye Unseen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>A circle pierced by a cross...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's the same as the mark Sol had on his forehead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's time, Nero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>A d-dark...sun?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I will grant you the end you seek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Big Bang!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You wish to create a sun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Once plucked, flowers wilt and wither away. Of course, that is what makes them so beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I understand that your intention is to pluck the flowers whose seeds you have sown at the very moment when their beliefs bear fruit. However, it seems to me that Sol is ripe for the picking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hmm. Yes. Do you know, just last week I found a seven-colored blossom! I was terribly disappointed to see it wilt only a few days later. It was a real rarity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Such a shame... If only I'd been able to show it off to the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I can understand that. Whenever I stumble across an incredible play, I can't help but spread the word to everyone I meet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That, my friend, is why I desire to find a way of plucking a blossoming flower without causing it to wilt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Interesting... Would you then replant the seeds, leaving behind a whole patch of them so that future generations could enjoy the same scene?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I would indeed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That could work with dried flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Precisely! I will leave behind a bouquet of dried flowers, entangled with my roots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The moment those seeds are planted will be the same moment in which my beliefs will come to fruition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yes! In that moment, I will blossom into bloom! I'll take the pruning shears to my own foliage! And you will be there to enjoy the show!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>We have a lot in common, don't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>My commandment is Unyielding. I refuse to bend to the will of another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You wish to die in the spotlight as well, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Sol. He...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>He is sealed within that eye of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>He died, but he remains as a fragment of Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>H-how is that possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Your prosthetic eye maintains your lifeforce by accumulating the Alchemia of dimensional power in the vicinity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Drei used this property to seal Sol's remains on an alchemical level within your eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>At present, no method of reviving someone from such a state exists. We wouldn't even be able to remove his remains from where they are sealed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Drei sowed the seeds that could create a sun. As for whether they will bear fruit...only God knows the answer to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>At the end of the day, it probably comes down to how hard you're willing to work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Good news, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Regardless of what you call yourself, you're more than just a jester.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Can you be honest with me, for once? What was it you wanted in all this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Jesters are employed to serve rulers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I only wanted to join the Templars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I only wanted to make friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I only wanted to be with others like me. People with the same powers and the same social standing. People who had made the same mistakes. People who were just as inhuman as I was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Is that all? You picked the worst possible way to go about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>But even so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You are one of us. You are a Templar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>281</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>282</td>
<td>You're our ne'er-do-well Number Six.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Haha. I'll take it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'm just telling you what Sol would have. He always brought light to people like us, who have nowhere else to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>If only we had met on a different stage...we might have actually gotten to fight side by side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Maybe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>283</td>
<td>Ooh! Don't look now, but mama's watching us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>284</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Mama? Are you listening? I made some friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>We all costarred in a play!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>285</td>
<td>If only you could have seen it, Mama... Oh, how I wish I could introduce you to them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>286</td>
<td>Then allow me to do one final thing for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>287</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>288</td>
<td>A curtain call for the Templars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>289</td>
<td>Ooh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>290</td>
<td>Eins, the First, the one who started it all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>291</td>
<td>Zwei, the Second, who fought with everything she had, right up until her dying breath. Drei, the Third, who never once disappointed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>292</td>
<td>Vier, the Fourth, who helped us dream pleasant dreams. FÃ¼ry, the Fifth, whose prayers were always full of kindness. Sieba, the Seventh, whose resolve knew no bounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>293</td>
<td>Neun, the Ninth, who gave us our most precious commandment. Zehn, the Tenth, who gave our group its soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>294</td>
<td>Acht, the Eighth, who ate us out of house and home. Sol was our Number Zero, who carried all of us on his shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>295</td>
<td>Y-you've left out Zechs, the Number Six!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>296</td>
<td>I hadn't forgotten. Zechs, the Sixth, who played his part as he saw fit, and made the most daring cameo of all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>297</td>
<td>Hahahaha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>298</td>
<td>You played the role of our greatest villain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>299</td>
<td>Then I guess I fit right in. The Templars are a pretty evil-looking bunch when you line them all up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>300</td>
<td>Let's give them a warm round of applause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>301</td>
<td>*Clap* *Clap* *Clap* *Clap*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>302</td>
<td>*Clap* *Clap* *Clap* *Clap*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Please...keep watching...until the curtain falls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>303</td>
<td>I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>304</td>
<td>Ma...ma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>305</td>
<td>I'm here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Th-thank...you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Sorry, Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I'm running on empty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Acht!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Nngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Someone's holding me in their arms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>There's something familiar about these arms. They feel just like the ones that used to hold me when I was kept hungry and starved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Acht. Can you hear me? I want to thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Meeting you and the other Templars has helped me regain fragments of my memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>That never would have been possible without your sacrifices: memory, perception of color, sleep, healing, faith, the joy and taste of food...and your arms, Acht.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Above all else, it was your blood that restored my memories. Or, to be more precise...the blood of something that lingers within you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Wh-what do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>You're so kind, Acht.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>B-Bianca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>You were abandoned by the world, but you could never bring yourself to throw anything away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You're amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>You even held on to that cute dress. It still looks good on you, Amu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I-is it...really you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I'm proud of you. You've been so brave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I-it is you! H-how is this possible?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Shh. It's going to be all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>B-but I... I thought you died!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I invited her here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Nero... I suppose this is the first time we've met first to face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Even though you're my other half.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Wh-what? I don't understand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Let's just say I helped make it possible, and leave it at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>As I watched you climb Veda, I recognized something...familiar in you. So I did what I do best: used clairvoyance to show me the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Familiar? Familiar how?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Listen to me, Acht. If you had not elected to climb the tower, I never would have learned of Bianca's existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>You only have yourself to thank for this reunion. It's all the result of your hard work and perseverance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I...did this? Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Not alone. Every single climb attempted by the Templars contributed to this outcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>You mean we...did this together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Yes. Everything you went through meant something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Bianca... Who are you really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Bianca is a name meaning white.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>And Nero is a name meaning black.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>That...doesn't tell me much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>We are two halves of a whole. Light and darkness. I am Nero Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Ouroboros?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>We were the skin shed by Ouroboros, the Primordial Serpent, when she elected to take on a human form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Together, we are Mystic Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>But when we are apart, I am Bianca Ouroboros. Nero's counterpart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>In the impact of being shed from our mother, Nero was separated from her memories. I am the form those memories took on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>I alone retained her memories from the time of creation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>As well as Ouroboros's capacity for Eternal Recurrence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Does that mean you're ageless and...immortal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>306</td>
<td>Something like that. However, unlike Nero, I do not possess the ability to bestow power, and I can no longer take on my draconic form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>307</td>
<td>Furthermore, my combat-related abilities, unused for so long, have entered a dormant state. It is difficult to wield them while maintaining this human form, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>However, over the course of my long journey to find myself, I did learn one thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Our mother, Ouroboros, can detect soul bonds, and lead those who are strong of will down the path to power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Naturally, there are many people who cannot hope to obtain such powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>In other words, those who would turn their back on their truth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Will never receive Ouroboros's boon. It makes perfect sense to me. Such powers would be dangerous in their hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>However, I cannot help but root for those who have lost their soul bonds and desperately seek to regain them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>I always find myself wishing to see them fight against their lot in life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>I feel the same way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Even I don't know why we were born with this contrary impulse to go against our mother, Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>I don't know any more than you do. Perhaps it's necessary in order to maintain balance in this world... Or perhaps we are simply a pair of eternally troubled teens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>At the end of the day, all I can say is that it was you, Acht, who gave rise to this possibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>M-me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>I wandered for a long time before I found you, in one of the darkest pits of the world. You were an inspiration to me even then! You had been trampled and suppressed, yet you fought with strength and dignity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>I wanted to support your struggle however I could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>308</td>
<td>I couldn't give you much, but I could give you my blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Time and time again, her blood helped you recover from wounds that would otherwise have been fatal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>My blood couldn't enhance your lifeforce, grant you eternal youth, or make you immortal...but it did make it a little harder for you to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I like to think I made the right call.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Anyway... Congratulations on climbing Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>B-Bianca, I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Listen well. The source of our power lies here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>I still do not know what form our power takes, so I could not have told you before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>And I am incapable of granting power to anyone, so there was nothing I could do to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Yet now that we have been reunited, we can bestow our combined power upon someone for the first time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>The kind of power that the Templars have always dreamed of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Yes. Between us we possess one of the Sources of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>The foundation of the dimensional powers you and your friends came to wield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>What we can offer is the power of absolute destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>D-destruction!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>We would need to take the entire world as compensation. It would be sent away to another dimension, leaving a blank slate in its place, so that a new era could begin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Th-the entire world...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Yes, the price is high. But think what you could gain by resetting the world! You could lead a new and better life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>It'd be a hard reset, so to speak, except that it would be centered around a single individual. Around you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Is that really all we can do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Nero...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>What about the sort of human power that Sol wished for? Or the power of revival that Zehn yearned for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>In a sense, starting anew covers all those things, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Be honest with me, Acht. And with yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Acht? Is this not what you were hoping for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Acht?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Acht.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Do you seek power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Come to think of it, the reason you called yourself the sun...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Was probably because you were afraid of being alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>You gathered friends and comrades to your side to pick a fight with the world at large, not realizing until it was too late that you'd chosen the loneliest path there is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Similarly, I'm sure the reason you created the commandments...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Was because you could feel your willpower slipping through your fingers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Unbreakable. Unyielding. Determined. Uncompromising. Harmony. Honesty. Memory. Unforgivable. Unrestrained. Disillusioned and distasteful. These are our commandments. If I had to add another, it would be...Dissatisfied.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>No. This isn't what I want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>The only one left to uphold them is me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>I'm dissatisfied with this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>I am all alone. I can feel my willpower slipping through my fingers. Therefore...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>I've decided on a new commandment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Commandment Number Twelve: Dissatisfied. Never grow complacent. Not even in the midst of sadness, misery, or regret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Even if you fill your belly in the morning, it will be empty again by nightfall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>By the same token, no matter how full of sadness you find yourself, you will heal one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Whatever you are going through, you can make it your strength. You can use it to help you grow..</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Thank you for the meal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>You haven't even eaten anything yet, squirt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Sol and I haven't taken our culinary trip around the world yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>It's far too soon for me to call it quits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>But Acht...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Haven't you ever thought about throwing everything away and starting over from scratch?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>I don't see what's wrong with that. If you're tired of this world, why not destroy it and let it begin anew?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Some things will never be possible, no matter how hard you work towards them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>This could be your only chance to undo Sol's death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>As for that dream you shared...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>If you restart the world, you might just be lucky enough to make it happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Leading a life where I always win does sound appealing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Doesn't it just?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>Losing hurts, in more ways than one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>Even so...my choice is clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>Once, I lived because of the blood I drank.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Since then, I've encountered more than my fare share of failures and losses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>However, it's because of those losses that I met Sol and he gave me an eyepatch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>So I have to keep fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>I will fight against this world, and the reality of Sol's loss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>I will bring him back, no matter what it takes. I will never stop searching for a way to restore him.</td>
</tr>

<td>225</td>
<td>The strength to fight the odds and turn the world around.</td>

<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>You've become quite eloquent, Acht.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>I don't want to use the power you are offering me right now. I want to save it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>Are you certain? Without this power, nothing will change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>I want to see what I can achieve with my own power first.</td>

<td>You might think that's a waste of effort, but...</td>

<td>...</td>

<td>Interesting... In other words, you choose life, with all its ups and downs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>There's a word for people like you: fearless.</td>

<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>Will you deride my desperate struggle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>No. Not at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>

<td>Acht.</td>

<tr>

<td>Yes?</td>

<td>I have witnessed the strength of your bonds. I trust in your fighting spirit.</td>

<tr>

<td>You held out your hand to me again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>265</td>
<td>You're hungry, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>266</td>
<td>And I seized it with both of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>267</td>
<td>I'm starved!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>268</td>
<td>Together, we joined the end of the cue, beneath blue skies that extend as far as the eye can see.</td>

<td>Are you still in? Even if it's boiling hot or pouring rain?</td>

<td>It's a silly little fantasy, but it's all I have. I hope it made you smile.</td>

<tr>
<td>273</td>
<td>Sol?</td>

<tr>
<td>274</td>
<td>You won't leave me, will you? Never ever?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>275</td>
<td>Never ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>276</td>
<td>Luna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>277</td>
<td>I will make sure the world never forgets your name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>278</td>
<td>I didn't let go then, and I won't let go now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>279</td>
<td>We are forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>280</td>
<td>And I will shine on until morning comes.</td>
