<td>It's the same everywhere; there are the predators and there are the prey. Ultimately, someone ends up grievingâ€”someone ends up crying...</td>

<td>Nothing has changed since back then, but there's nothing I can do about it.</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>I've decided not to get involved anymore. That way, I'll no longer have anything to lose...</td>

<td>I'm out of water. Perhaps I'll buy it here and rest a little while I'm at it.</td>

<td>Traveling alone, huh? That's an unusual hobby.</td>

<td>Oh, sorry if I put you off. I was bored and looking for someone to keep me company. Look, I'm making this accessory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I make for a dull conversation partner. I suggest you look elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You sure about that? I've got this feeling we could have great conversations together. You know, "birds of a feather" and all that.</td>

<td>You don't have to look so alarmed. I'm not out to harm you. I mean it.</td>

<td>Me? I'm...yeah, I guess I'm Blossom right now.</td>

<td>Right now...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yeah. Don't worry about it. You might call it my street name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Is it Blossom because that accessory you're making is a rose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Aha, great observation! All right then, let's say that's the reason! Hehe. So you're going to keep me company, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, even if I ignore you, you seem the type that'll keep talking anyway.</td>

<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Is that your impression of me? Well, going back to what we were talking about earlier, what are you doing in a place like this? It's really not the safest neighborhood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I know it's dangerous here, but I don't have anywhere else to return to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Heheh. If you just hand over everything you've got, you won't have to suffer, ya know?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Sigh... This really isn't the best neighborhood. So, what're you going to do, traveler?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I will not stand for this!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, it doesn't look like you need any motivation. I'd prefer if things didn't get out of hand, so I think I'll help you out a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hahah! I won't let any of you escape!</td>
