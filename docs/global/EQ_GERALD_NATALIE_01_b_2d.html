<td>Brother Gerald...!</td>

<td>Don't think about the numbers! Just focus on bringing down the monster in front of you while I draw the bulk of the horde away from here!</td>

<td>Taking them on alone is too reckless! Surely there is something else that can beâ€”!</td>

<td>No! This is the only way we can...nnnghh!</td>

<td>Gerald! No!</td>

<td>We must protect the village! Compared to what could be lost if we falter, a wound like this is nothing!</td>

<td>I'm fine. See to the other members first.</td>

<td>I already have. You're the only one left who needs my attention.</td>

<td>I see. Good.</td>

<td>That's fine. Whatever it takes for me to be ready to fight another day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Mhm. You know, you keep fighting like this, and you won't be around to welcome Vettel back. He'll only have your gravestone to talk to.</td>

<td>Why don't we go eat something sweet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I was just thinking it might be a nice change of pace. Besides, I could go for some dessert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You know I don't have time for frivolous things like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey! Where do you think you're going?! I haven't even finished patching you up! Haa... What am I going to do with him?</td>
