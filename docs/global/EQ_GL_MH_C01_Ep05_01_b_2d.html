<td>Is that... the town up ahead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Looks like it. My, it seems rather quaint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The party head into town, finding merchants and shophouses lining the streets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh. It's pretty lively. Wonder if they've got a booming trade center or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Let's get a place to stay while we're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Why, that woman again...! Is she stalking us or something?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(Uh oh. Sieg...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(I'm not dealing with this again...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hello. This is a rather strange place to meet, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Not as strange as why the blazes you're following us around...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Pardon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Nothing. Carry on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If you say so. Work takes me everywhere, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Have you come to this town before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Mm, yes. Such a tiny settlement on the outskirts, and yet oddly developed. A contradiction, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yeah. We're pretty curious why. We're accompanying Teach on a research trip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I see. Hmhm... I have heard snippets here and there from the merchants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This town is under the patronage of a Greed Dike noble, who sought to expand his influence by investigating the local folk legends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>As part of his creed to protect the populace, he had security installed and the area well-supplied in case any threat was found.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ah. That is an acceptably logical explanation for its apparent prosperity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Indeed. Well, I do hope you enjoy your time here. It is a rather relaxing place to be, if I may say so myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What does everyone make of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't buy a single thing that comes out of her mouth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I hope you're referring to that story about the noble and his "protection policy."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No matter how I look at it, something else definitely caught his attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hmph. Men are all the same!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm going to book our rooms. Soren, you're coming with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Wouldn't want you catching his stupidity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh? Me? W-wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Well, this ought to be a fun trip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I have no idea what's going on...</td>
