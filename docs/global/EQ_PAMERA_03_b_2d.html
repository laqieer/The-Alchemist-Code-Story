<td>Whoohoo! We won!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I wouldn't lose to someone who fights so sloppily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ngh... Don't think we'll just stand by and let you defy us! Weâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We? Who might this we be? I'd love it if you could explain in greater detail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Celine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Just because these children have no one else to turn to doesn't mean you can go around using corporal punishment on them! You will withdraw, immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You...and all those behind this travesty...should be ashamed of yourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Just in time! Thank you! You saved us, Ms. Celine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Goodness... How rare to get such a frank show of gratitude from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Emma? What's all this then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, you see... After class, I asked her for a bit of help, since I got the sense that someone real scary had their eyes on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I, myself, had also caught on to their suspicious dealings, but I didn't have the means to handle it at the time, so this was the perfect chance to take care of business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>By making the confrontation a public one, even the high and mighty Helkovara family will be left with no choice but to accept the outcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ms. Celine...! Thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's fine, my dear. Heh heh. You can thank me thoroughly later when we're all alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ahem...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hm? Oh, sorry... Anyway, it's rare for Emma to get so serious, isn't it, Noah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Emma is very dedicated to her friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I do believe that is why she got so intense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I have a lot of faith in Emma, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Noah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That said, I would have liked for her to consult me about her suspicions, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>For that matter, if you were going to talk to the teacher about it, you could have at least mentioned it to me! I was prepared to be expelled, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Pamela, you owe us an apology, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh?! Me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes, you! You can't let creeps like that push you around! Do you have any idea how worried we were to see that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry! Forgive me, Mommy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Mommy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Emma?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh, nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ahh, I'm tired. Writing that report took forever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It couldn't be helped. At least we didn't get punished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Of course we didn't! We didn't do anything wrong! Ugh... I was supposed to work today, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Even I haven't finished all of my homework yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's not what matters at the heart of it! Look here, you two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hm...? Oh, wow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>A beautiful, starry sky...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It's so inspiring! I have to hurry home and make some new accessories!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Now that you mention it, Pamela... You have on such cute accessories. Did you make them yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes! Do you want me to make you something, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What, really? Yay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Only Noah gets one? No fair! I want one, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You do? You want one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Of course I do! Anything inspired by this beautiful sky will make such a cute accessory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It will be like a memorial to the day friendship bloomed among the three of us! Doesn't that sound great?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Emma really likes these symbolic kinds of things... Anniversaries and matching items.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Really? But...earlier, you said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It only counts when you have a friendship to celebrate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Eheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>All right! Then all three of us will match! I have so many ideas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huwaaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Wow, what a big yawn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>W-what? N-no! The night is still young!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Today was a tiring day. How about you get some sleep tonight and make accessories tomorrow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That's a good idea. Don't you worry, Pamela... I'm sure you won't ever forget this starry sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Tomorrow, let's have a do-over lunch to make up for today, hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Okay! Ooh! I'll bring a camera!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>All right. Now we have something to look forward to, right, Pamela?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yeah! See you tomorrow!</td>
