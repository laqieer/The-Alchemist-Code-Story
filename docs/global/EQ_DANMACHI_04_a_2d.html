<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>So you and Ais are members of different Familia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You two seem so close, I would've sworn you were comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What? No, no. It's nothing like that. It's more like, Ais is always saving my butt when I'm in trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Is that all? For someone who's not on your team, per se, you sure do talk her up a lot... Oh, wait, I get it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>She's that person you said you look up to more than anyone else in the world, isn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>She's still leagues ahead of me, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But you always inspire me to do my best, Bell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Only because you always find me when I'm in a desperate situation, so you have to or I'm toast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I could only make out so much from that distance, but in the battle earlier, your moves seemed very similar to hers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's because Ais taught me how to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Trained by the person you admire? Gotta say, I'm kinda jealous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Just meeting someone you really look up to can change the entire course of your life...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But then getting close enough to that person to receive training? You really are blessed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, I know. The people I keep company with are like a rock for me. I count my blessings every day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But meeting Ais isn't why you became an adventurer, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Th-that's right! I mentioned it a little before, but I owe becoming an adventurer to my goddess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>She took me in as one when I was on my own and had nothing else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Saved by one, and trained by another, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Like Lord Zahar and Corvus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So you have some special people in your life too, then, Ila?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>After my parents were killed, all adults were tainted for me. I couldn't bring myself to trust them anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But Lord Zahar, he was different from the rest. And Corvus... Well, I couldn't stand him, but I can't deny he taught me a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Having people I could trust was important to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's right. Meeting someone who means something to you is always worthwhile, no matter how things turn out in the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Think of a parent and child, for example. If the child was unwanted, you often hear of the parent acting distant toward them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Maybe down the line, things will change and one of them will want to get closer to the other...but by then, it's probably too late. You can't let opportunities like that pass you by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Sounds like you've been through a lot too, Kevin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ahahah. It hasn't always been a bed of roses, that's for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But I was given hope, a future...even happiness itself, all by a person whose name I don't even know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Here. Something to celebrate the four of us coming together like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What nonsense are you up to now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>A little surprise, using my telekinesis. Out from the smoke, flowers appear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Okay, but why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Was that a laugh? Did you smile?! What a shame I wasn't looking. I'd have liked to have seen that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Aaaaaah, somebody! Save meeeeee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What theâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I know that voice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Look, a pack of Rattys is headed this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>S-somebody, please! Bell, where aaare yooouuu?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Numaaa! Numaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's as if they're playing tag!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You're right. They're just toying with her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I don't care if they're playing or attacking...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I won't let anyone mess with my goddess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That's your goddess? The one you called Hestia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Bell! There you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Heads up! There's a demon behind the Rattys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Another one, huh? Looks like trouble, Bell. Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Sit tight, Goddess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Oh, Bell! My Bell!</td>
</tr>
