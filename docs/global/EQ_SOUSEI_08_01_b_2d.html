<td>I heard about the Ceremony of Creation from him.</td>

<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>A mere collaboration. Nothing more.</td>
</tr>

<td>One which the Infinite Serpent has taken over, after your wish to remake the world went unfulfilled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Indeed. It has taken far too long for my will to form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>My flesh and blood, the Shell of the World, has been far too eroded by the sins of humans. I am no longer capable of maintaining it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>But if the shell can be broken, so too can rebirth be invoked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>I, the cradle of the dragons, shall be broken by those who are destined to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>But there is another way, isn't there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>I suppose there is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Daughter of the Sephira, do you intend to inherit it, then? Will you become the cornerstone of Truth for the next era?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>I am a Vessel of Purification. All my life, I have been trained to serve as a receptacle for sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>The hidden magic that is engraved upon me—that of the last Sephira—prevents my very being from succumbing to sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>So there wouldn't even be any need for me to withstand the corruption that eats away at you; it would simply dissipate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>If I were to take your place, that alone should be enough to save the world...no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>There is no way a human body of flesh and bone can endure the test of time forevermore. Once that body turns to dust, the world will simply be consumed by corruption once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>Then I'll just use Space-Time Manipulation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>If I stop time within me and become a mere vessel for filtering the world's sins, then—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>You foolish child! That's no different than being dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>If a sacrifice is required no matter what, then I believe this is the best way to save as many people as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Hmm... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>I have finally come to understand. The sin you bear is not Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>It is Pride. Or, more to the point, it is sheer arrogance. Arrogance in thinking your being is of equal import as the world. Undoubtedly, it is the will of the dragons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>Is that...a backhanded compliment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Indeed it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>It is not loyalty or righteous self-sacrifice for which you give yourself up, but the desire to fulfill your own wish...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>And that is your strength; a strength we never possessed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>I accept your proposal, child of Pride. You are well-suited to hold the world's destiny in your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>Urgh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>If you are truly so resolved, then let the pain and crushing weight you feel guide you forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Bear it well, ye who now balance the world's scales. For though I cannot see where this path may lead you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Surely...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>Ghaaah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>You got what you wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>I...did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>The real show starts now. You have three Cursed Beast cores, and Nimul's got another three.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>If you want to gain the power to tear down the Truth of this world—the power of Alchemy—you're going to need the final core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>I know. But with this...the world has lost its Observer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>Now, the future can only be shaped by our own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Our next destination is Superbia Belt. That all right by you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>Are you sure, though? You could always betray me. If you betrayed me now, you could go back to the time you wanted to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>You mean because the Libra is broken? It would be difficult for me to defeat Asmodeus by myself, especially with her at her peak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Besides, I have it on good authority she's not crying anymore...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>So I'm willing to let it go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>Okay. Then what are we waiting for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Right. Let's go save the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Confirming shutdown of virtual personality region. Beginning full system scan. Resetting environmental maintenance parameters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Restarting the Ouroboros System.</td>
