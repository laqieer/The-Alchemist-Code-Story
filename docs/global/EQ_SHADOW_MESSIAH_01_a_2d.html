<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Both times, the Holy Guard stole them from me.</td>

<td>Did you save me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I did. You've been through much, but you can rest easy now. Letitia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>My name's Spica. Um, what's yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>(I couldn't save him. I lost the dark sun who lit my path—Lord Zahar.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(And yet...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Of course, part of me did resent you deeply for killing Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But more significantly, I felt gratitude towards you two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? Gratitude?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I always continued adoring Lord Zahar, and I didn't want to see his further deterioration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You two fulfilled that earnest wish of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I feel like you have it in you to stop the spiral of suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Kanon! I'm sure you have it in you to stop the spiral of suffering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Please use your powers to build a world where people don't get lost in sorrow like I did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Whoaaaaaaa!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Spica!</td>

<td>Excalibur is meant for saving people.</td>

<td>Kanon!</td>

<td>Lord Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I will go. I will join the Lord Commander of the Holy Guard.</td>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(Lord Zahar—no. Letitia. Corvus. Ila. Even Silma, waiting for me in the forest...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(Having left all of you—and the Shadow Messiah—behind, I don't think I have the right to do this.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(Yet in spite of that—no, because of that, I will go.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(I didn't understand what Lord Zahar was leaving me with at the time.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(What is this will that connects to the future? I have to find out what he meant.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(And I believe that this is something only I can do.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(It might not be in exactly the way we intended, but now I...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I want to uphold our vow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's time for a trip down memory lane.</td>

<td>Aaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You'll pay for this, Shadow Messiah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hmph. In a hurry, are we? Well, corrupt dogs of the Holy Order...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>If you wish to run away with your tails between your legs, we won't stop you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I will not let you harm Lord Zahar!</td>

<td>Wh-what the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Aaaaaghh!</td>

<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(I won't be able to get out of the way in time!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Nrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Come on, Spica. You should know better by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Sorry, Corvus...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>

<tr>

<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I know, I know! Come on, Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>R-right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Lord Zahar! You were right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>So you found them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Yes. There were a large amount of Philosopher's Stones in the basement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Guess this must be a research facility of some kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>There are traces of blood... and the hair or fur of some kind of animal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>They were experimenting on animals, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Oh no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Disgusting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>How could they?! I wanna give 'em a piece of my mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Hey! Pack up these Philosopher's Stones. We're taking them back with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Huh? What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>It's some sort of black... stone. I suppose it's just a stray rock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Show it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Yes, my lord!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Is it valuable? Looks like a regular rock to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>What do you think, Letitia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Oh, my. I haven't seen one of these in ever so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>What? A rock?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Hee hee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Hah. I knew it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Knew what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Huzzaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Tch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>You move too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>No way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>This is how it's done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Wh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Ow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Dang it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Why can't I beat you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Perhaps someday you will—I wonder how long that will take? Weeks? Months? Years?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Nrgh! Lemme try again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>If you must.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Hey! Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Silma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>What's the matter? You okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Yeah. I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>You're not still thinking about what Lord Zahar said earlier, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Get up, Spica. The weak will be left behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>A bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Don't let it get you down! That's just his way of encouraging you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>You've just gotta keep at it! Use the full force of your love for Lord Zahar to get stronger and stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>L-love? I-I don't... It's nothing like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I just want to be useful to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I know, I know! Love is complicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I told you, I don't—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>That's it! I've got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I'm going to get strong so you don't have to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>H-huh? What do you mean, Silma?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Hah! Hrgh! Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Tch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Hey! Hey, Corvus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>What's this? Are you going to challenge me now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>That's right! I'm here to avenge Ila!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Hey! I'm not dead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Huzzaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Nope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Ouch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Really, now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Aw... He got me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>(Spica's been quiet ever since we got back that day.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Hey—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>(It's okay... The darkness inside me has nothing to fear. I'm not losing sight of my goal.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>(I know who I am. I'm Lord Zahar's advisor, nothing more.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Actually, never mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>O-okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>(Whatever's going on with those two, it's not like I need to worry about it. I'm not their keeper.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>(Still...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>(The members of the Shadow Messiah need to be strong if we're going to achieve our ambitions.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>(That would make this something I need to do for Lord Zahar, to help make our ambitions a reality.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Spica.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Y-yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>I was thinking—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Lady Letitia has asked me to go hunting today. I'll be heading out shortly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>It's that time already, huh? Time flies...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Yes, sir. I'll take my leave then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>(A hunt... I could use this.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Yes, sir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>I'll do the hunting today. You stay here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>A-are you sure, sir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Yes—but I won't be going alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Ila, Silma, Spica... You're coming with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>We're going hunting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Hunting?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Eep...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Wow! Down in one hit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Now it's your turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>All right! Ready or not, here I come! Come out, come out, wherever you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Um... Corvus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>What is it? You'd better get a move on if you want to eat tonight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Well, um... Spica and I used to live in the forest, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>We can't help but see animals as our friends, and it just wouldn't feel right to hunt your friends, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Then you don't mind going hungry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Nnngh! I'm sorry, forest critters! I'm sorry, Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Do you think I'm cruel, Spica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>I understand. I eat meat, too. To survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Exactly. That's all it is. You have to eat to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>And you're going to need to survive if you want to help Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Yes... I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>Hello there, Mister Rabbit...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Mister Rabbit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>Tch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>I'm so sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>Groooaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>There's something in the forest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Ooh! Something we can hunt?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>

<tr>
<td>227</td>

<td>A mythical beast!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>Look sharp! It's comin'!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>Get ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>Wait—we're going to attack it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
