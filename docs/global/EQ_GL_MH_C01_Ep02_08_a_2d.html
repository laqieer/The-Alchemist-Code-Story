<td>They haven't caught up to us—for now. Are you hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No... Thank you, Siegfried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Still... the Divine Protector continues to rampage. At this rate, it will destroy the shrine and everyone within.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's what I feared. You were using Alchemy—what you call prayers, or essence, to power your Divine Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Simply put, Alchemy isn't exactly very stable. There were not enough Alchemia particles to sustain it, and as such, it needed to locate a source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You mean... it was seeking more of the essence in our blood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>How do I put it...? You seem to have a high concentration of Alchemia particles, making you a prime target. The power you possess has the potential to be very dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I... see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I trust you're all fine? Ah... good. Greetings. My name is Shion.</td>

<td>I am a retainer to the noble house of Wadatsumi. My Lord has much interest in expanding our businesses, and as such I was sent here in search of trading opportunities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I suppose it was inevitable that this village would fall prey to greedy raiders, given the quality of its products.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Good to meet you, and thanks for the help. You're pretty skilled with a blade... but I'm sure that's to be expected of a retainer from Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A lady must learn to protect herself. Where I come from, dancing with blades is a common skill for noblewomen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My attendants and I were ambushed on the way to the village by savage monsters. Being the only one trained in the way of the sword, I alone went in search of help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>When I came in view of the settlement, I was aghast to find it in chaos. The village elder told me there was something amiss at the mountain shrine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I could not, in good conscience, request for aid when the village is in such a state. I came to see if there was anything I could do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You have a good heart, Shion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Thank you, I would save the praise for later. Our priority is to make it out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Right.</td>
