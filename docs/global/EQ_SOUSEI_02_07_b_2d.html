<td>What was that? It...hurt. It actually hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I've never seen anything like this before. We weren't built to withstand this kind of power, whatever it is. Ugh... We're going to have to report this to Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hold it! Where do you think you're going?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You think we're just going to let you go after all this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>My body won't...move?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We know you. You are us. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...this timeline is ours! So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...return to the future from whence you came! The us who belong to this time and place have not yet Fallen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hah...haha...hahahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This is futile! The future doesn't change!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Just shut up and get out of here already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hahh...hahh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Is...is Ambrosia...? Is she still alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tsk! How dare you assume I'm dead! I'm still full of life! Urgh...grngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Please, don't move! If you push yourself too much, your wounds will reopen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hmph! How dare you underestimate a witch such as I! I would have survived even if all that was left of me was my head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Besides, I still have far too much to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Do...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I call upon you, Libra⁠!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>All that you yet carry⁠—release!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Grooooooooooaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I-it worked?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>How can it still be standing after taking a blow like that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ahh... I knew it. It wasn't enough power to defeat it, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Grrraoooooooooooohh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast is...withdrawing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I suspect that it is heading back to recuperate and lick its wounds, having witnessed the power of Libra. Back to the Temple of Lust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The...Temple of Lust?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes. Cursed Beasts possess a temple that is the manifestation of their sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It is the foundation of the beast's hold on this world, and the cornerstone of the truth imposed upon us all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>In order to truly defeat the Cursed Beast, we must also destroy its temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>To do so, we will need the Gears of Judgment, which represent the seven virtues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I take it the magic rod Libra is one of them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's just a prototype. It couldn't even pierce through the creature's shell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>How unbelievably vexing... I so wanted to be able to put an end to the Cursed Beast here and now on my own, but I couldn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well, my foolish friends... Now you have seen for yourselves the true strength of the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Do you still plan to face them, regardless of how insurmountable your task?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yes. Of course. Please, will you help us? We have need of your wisdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hah! Good answer. In that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>First, take me to my bed! I need rest. I have no magil, no energy, no anything left in me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Y-you... You need to be more careful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You can't just throw yourself into situations like that, putting everything on the line! I was so worried, I nearly had a stroke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Ahh...my silly apprentices. I always forget that you are still only children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(The Gears of Judgment...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(If they are necessary to defeat the Cursed Beasts...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(I must learn all I can of them, so that I will finally be able to protect all that I hold dear. And not only that...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(At last, I can reshape the world!)</td>
