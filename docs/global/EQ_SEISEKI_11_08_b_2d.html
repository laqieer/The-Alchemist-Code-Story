<td>N-no... It's impossible...to bring this much darkness into this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wh-what's happening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I-I miscalculated the extent of the situation... Now Kanon is the only one who can do anything about this with her powers of light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And...it's time to pull my last trick out of my sleeve. I was planning to use this as a last resort, and it seems that we've come to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wh-what is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I must also draw upon the darkness that this body has absorbed without completely losing my mind in order to stop Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>B-but then you might end up trapped with Zahar again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's better than setting him loose on this world! Making sure that the darkness doesn't win takes precedence over my own well-being!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Grgnhhhhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>A-ahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I have to do this now before it's too late! Miu, I leave the rest to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>W-wait, what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>C-Captain Cadanova! It's almost...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Grgnhhhhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ack?! Uwaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ug...ugff...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm...sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Spica?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The darkness is abating?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>S-Spica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Lord Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Y-you...struck me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Forgive me... I... I always hoped for this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I...always regretted that...I did not stop you before you went too far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That I could finally take advantage of the chance to stop you this time is a gift beyond all others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Gah... Ngh... S-stopping...m-me...is...a gift...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I have struggled to come to terms with my own failure to recognize it last time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It has been one of my greatest regrets...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That I have the chance to take action this time... It allows me a chance to redeem myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If there is no way for me to calm the anger you cannot suppress, then at least I can divert it away from the world with my own sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Don't be a fool! The darkness already has a strong hold on him. The Zahar you see before you is not the one you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Stand back! This is between me and Lord Zahar. If you try to stop me, you'll have to answer to my blade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Spica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hehe... You... You still have so much to learn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Stand up...for what you believe in... Even if...it means...the world...turns against you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That is...the justice I believe in. You... You should be able to...carry that on...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>C-Cadanova! Haha... I'll see you when you rejoin me in hell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>We'll settle...our differences with...each other...then. Haha... You had better...be prepared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hmph. That is my line. The next time we meet...will be our last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ha...haha... I look forward to it, my old...rival...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>On that day...I will finally...tear your...gutless "justice"...apart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>L-Lord...Zahar...? Lord Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>He disappeared...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Our true bodies are still trapped on the other side of the Door of Truth. This body of mine...it is not real, not in the same way that yours are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What?! Like...a Phantom?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Ah... Something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Spica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Lord Zahar said that I must stand up for what I believe in, even if the world turns against me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I... I believe in the world that you want to create, Kanon. Making that happen...will be the justice I devote myself to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>As long as I have breath in my body, I will stand with you. For myself...and to pay my respects to the man who once saved my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I understand. Thank you, Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>By the way, Captain Cadanova, what in the world is going on? How are you even in this world? I thought the two of you were still sealed in the other world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Has the seal been broken?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>This world and the other world were connected for just a moment. Don't worry, that bridge has already been taken care of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Only three people managed to come through back to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Three?! Meaning...there's another person out there like Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Ah... That reminds me. This is of no small consequence to you as well. I had best tell you all I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That temporary bridge was created between the two worlds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...when a certain man arrived in the other world from this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>A certain...man...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>And...the third person who returned from the world on the other side of the Door of Truth...is that man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Exactly. When that man arrived, his very presence distorted space in the other world. Perhaps it was because he had not completely fallen into the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I see... So...you knew this man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Indeed, I know him. As do you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>That person should not have been there. He couldn't accept where he was and his strong emotions caused a disruption that forced the two worlds to be connected again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>And so you...pushed him back here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Yes. I managed to return him to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>However, Zahar took advantage of that disruption and slipped through just before it could be resolved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I followed him, but I barely made it through. It was pretty close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>W-wait... A man I know that fell to that other world... It can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Yes. It was Kudan. He should be somewhere here in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...?! Here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Yes. I believe that he should still be in his own body, unlike Zahar and I. Somewhere in this world, Kudan lives on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Wh-whoa!!! What was that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What an incredibly large military force! And flying that huge flag... Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>There's smoke rising from the palace walls! I have to go!</td>
</tr>
