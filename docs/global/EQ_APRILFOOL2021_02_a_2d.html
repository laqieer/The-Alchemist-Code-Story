<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>They're the game's protagonists! The heroes...or, well, hero and anti-hero? Either way, they're the main characters of the overarching narrative!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...And?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>And, the story would be over if we beat them in the dang tutorial! We had to lose! My strength wasn't even a factor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But, even just one of them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They're both main characters! Take either one out of the equation and the whole story grinds to a halt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Really? They need two main characters? That's awfully greedy of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Technically, there are seven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Okay, okay. Your point is taken. But still, you were dealing damage in what, the double digits? And you're still willing to show your face in a character portrait?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It. Was. The. Tutorial!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What was I supposed to do, bust out a 7000-damage super move?! Who's ever heard of a tutorial where the boss deals 7000 damage?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Still, I'm sure there's something more you could've done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Fine. You want to dance this dance? Then let's not forget, you had to Summon me. So don't act like you have nothing to answer for here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Come, now, I was a regular human then, and already fatigued to the brink of collapse. Don't you remember the dialogue leading up to that fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I had to drink swamp water, things had been so rough! If anyone has an excuse, it's me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But you! You showed up as a Phantom Soldier. That's a whole different ball game. If I'd been at full strength like that, I would've whupped some serious keister, no doubt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Pshaw! Your keister would've been the whupped one, full strength or no. Again I ask, what kind of game has the main characters die in the tutorial?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, what kind of Phantom Soldier only deals double-digit damage?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yeah, if people have gotten all the way up to waiting for the Gate of Pride thinking that's what we're all about, then of course we're going to get brushed under the rug!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But I wasn't even Enlightened back then! I was only level ten, if you hadn't noticed! I think my damage output was pretty good, all things considered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Level ten?! What, were you taking your apples in slices like a posh nobleman?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Don't get cheeky with me! Just...forget the opening scenes, okay? That's not why we've been left hanging for so long; trust me on that! Can anyone think of any other reasons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Such as? If you're so convinced you're not at fault, then I say you come up with a plausible alternative yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well, then let's think. Are any of us just completely disliked by the players? Enough to make them not actually want us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Of course not! Don't be ridiculous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Really? Because I've seen a number of comments from players saying that you, Caesar, are a bit of a pain in the neck, since all you ever do is inflict Rage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hey, come on, now! You know that's how it has to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh, how the tables have turned! How it has to be, you say? Where have I heard that before? Tell me, then, why does it have to be that way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Because! That's our... You know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Our what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Our thing! Our characterization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What do you mean, characterization?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's not like I want to use Rage constantly! I'd rather fight with ordinary attacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But our entire character arc is about resurrection through Wrath. You know—in keeping with the whole "seven deadly sins" motif! At least one of us has to inflict Rage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So your combat technique is shaped entirely by blunt metaphor, is what you're saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Not...in those exact words. But you two certainly weren't going to pick the low-hanging fruit, and we couldn't very well let it rot on the vine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Our characterization is rather one-note to begin with. If you take away our Rage, what do we even have left to offer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh, come now! You're selling us quite a bit short, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Am I? Then tell me: what's my character like? What's your impression of me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Um, well, you're someone who...uses Rage a lot, and...you, uh, do other things as well, I believe! Such as, I don't remember, but nonetheless—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Couldn't have said it better myself. I don't have any character! No special traits of any kind. I'm just the guy with the long hair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>So by using Rage to a...frankly irresponsible extent, I could finally create an identity for myself. That's just who I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm...beginning to feel a little pity toward you, I can't deny. What of you, Vlad? Is there any reason the players might dislike you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Me? No, no. I'm in good standing, I dare say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Well, out of the three of us, I'm the least annoying to fight. I don't spam any attacks or do anything that anyone would particularly dread. I just go in half-heartedly swinging, and see what happens!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh, dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I don't even inflict Rage, and my attacks look like they could be tough, but then turn out to be perfectly manageable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I dare say, a big guy like me not actually being all that strong probably gives people a nice little chuckle! Might even make me kind of endearing. Hahaha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Why did I even ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh, I'm not self-deprecating, mind you! I'm just being realistic. No one knows you better than you know yourself, they say! Hahahaha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>When the three of us get together, like at Mobius, they usually don't bother bringing me out until last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>And nobody finishes on the loser of the group! So I'd say there's no way the players dislike me. I mean, can you imagine? Hahaha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You have got to be kidding me.</td>
</tr>
