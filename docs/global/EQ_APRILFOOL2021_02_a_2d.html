</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>But our entire character arc is about resurrection through Wrath. You know—in keeping with the whole "seven deadly sins" motif! At least one of us has to inflict Rage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>Not...in those exact words. But you two certainly weren't going to pick the low-hanging fruit, and we couldn't very well let it rot on the vine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>Our characterization is rather one-note to begin with. If you take away our Rage, what do we even have left to offer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>Um, well, you're someone who...uses Rage a lot, and...you, uh, do other things as well, I believe! Such as, I don't remember, but nonetheless—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>So by using Rage to a...frankly irresponsible extent, I could finally create an identity for myself. That's just who I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>I'm...beginning to feel a little pity toward you, I can't deny. What of you, Vlad? Is there any reason the players might dislike you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>

</tr>

<td>Are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>Well, out of the three of us, I'm the least annoying to fight. I don't spam any attacks or do anything that anyone would particularly dread. I just go in half-heartedly swinging, and see what happens!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>Oh, dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>I don't even inflict Rage, and my attacks look like they could be tough, but then turn out to be perfectly manageable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>I dare say, a big guy like me not actually being all that strong probably gives people a nice little chuckle! Might even make me kind of endearing. Hahaha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>Why did I even ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>Oh, I'm not self-deprecating, mind you! I'm just being realistic. No one knows you better than you know yourself, they say! Hahahaha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>When the three of us get together, like at Mobius, they usually don't bother bringing me out until last.</td>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>And nobody finishes on the loser of the group! So I'd say there's no way the players dislike me. I mean, can you imagine? Hahaha.</td>
