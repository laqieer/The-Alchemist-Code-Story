<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Time to meet "The Queen".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Emrys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The Queen is waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Morning, Red. Please lead the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>("Hmm, an underground throne room...")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Welcome to my abode, Emrys of Elylon Teg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>("How did they know about my clan?")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I see that you had gotten my summons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>("A child?")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>How should I address you, "Queen"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Pardon my rudeness. I am Eliza, Queen of the Slothstein Branch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I permit you to address me as Eliza.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>("Let's play along for now...")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It is my pleasure to meet you, Miss...</td>

<td>Madam.</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Apologies... Madam Eliza...</td>

<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>How did your organization get information on me? And why was I called here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Straight to the point, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>As a reward for your timely arrival, I shall tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We had eyes on you ever since you brought your sister to our facility for treatment. Remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>She was suffering from some rare curse that befalls an individual of your clan every generation, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I have seen the reports and we have a list of potential suspects that attacked that facility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>My sincerest apologies and gratitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>

<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's because of us that your facility was destroyed by the villain who took my sister.</td>

<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If I had just stayed instead of attending to my duties... Maybe I could have prevented it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I swear on my clan's name that I will avenge your fallen and save my sister!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Please stand, Emrys. We are on the same page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>My goal is to get even with that "Villian" and to save a patient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We pride ourselves as Goetia's bio-medical field. There is not a patient unsatisfied with our care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We lack "Combatants" to be sent out on a search and rescue mission alongside annoying internal affairs like the one you had kindly helped us with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>So, I have a proposal for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Assist me in getting rid of a few "affairs" and I will lend my hand in kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...I humbly accept your offer Madam Eliza.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Excellent...As we will be sending you into dangerous situations, I need to know if you can handle them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Do you need a demonstration?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But of course. Albeit what's a little show of power without any real danger?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I hope you don't mind. We have really good medical staff here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Won't be needing them.</td>
