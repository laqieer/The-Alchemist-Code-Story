<td>H-he ran away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There's not a single cool cell in his body...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I guess it is my fault that he's unhappy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No, he got what was coming to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If anything, he may be happier that he never got shot down by the girl he likes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Moa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I defended my country and became a well respected knight. I don't regret that one bit. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I had believed that I would never have the chance to wear a wedding dress. We truly can't choose where our life will take us though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I had a wonderful rehearsal, and it's all thanks to you, Moa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Lucretia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I feel wonderful now that I've had the opportunity to wear such a beautiful dress. The old me, who was always running away from death, had never known this happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Had you not forced me to come with you today, I still wouldn't know this happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>All I did was pick out a dress. How's that a big deal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We couldn't have experienced this without you, Moa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm so glad that I was able to try on a dress, and have such a great time with you all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You've made us both so happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Happy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Moa, even just going out in a cute outfit, or having fun with your friends...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Even things like that can bring someone happiness. You helped the both of them to be happy, Moa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's why I know that you can be happy too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Eve...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(I see now. There's still one person who I can make happy... Myself!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(Go ahead, feel happy.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>How about the rest of us wear dresses too! We can have a wedding dress party! Doesn't that sound like fun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yeah, that sounds like fun! Kon, bring me my dress from last time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Kon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ah! Hey! What are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>W-why do I have to as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This will be great! It'll be more fun if we all wear them together! Okay, Moa. Your turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh, please wait a moment! Please! Let us choose your dress, Moa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I-I'm okay... I'm less the bride and more of a bridesmaid...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Heehee. You can't get out of this. Let's go, Lucretia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Leave it to me. As you can see, it may be hard to get her into a dress. Hehehe. We'll make you our little dress-up doll.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I-I'm Cupid though! Cupid can't wear a wedding dress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Why can't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I think Cupid should be able to wear a wedding dress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You...do? Then, I guess so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yay! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Have a good time! Well then, could you all pick a dress for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Gladly! Hmm... Which one would be best?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hehehe. I wonder what kind of dress Moa will wear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It's never too late to be happy, so long as you'll do whatever it takes.</td>
