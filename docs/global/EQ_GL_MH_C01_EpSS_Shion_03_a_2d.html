<td>You know, Shion, there was something a little different in your dance just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I can't quite put my finger on it, but you seem more... relaxed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Or maybe I just haven't watched you dance in a long time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Fufu... Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Maybe it has to do with that merry band of travellers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Siegfried... He is an interesting one. He may work for the Holy Guard, but he does not share their principles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm far more amused by Roxanne, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ah, is she the feisty one you mentioned?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The very same. Fufu... the look on her face every time she sees me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's plain as day she has a thing for her childhood beau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>She is such a joy to tease. Doesn't take much to rile her up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Lucky for her, I have no interest whatsoever in her "Sieggy".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Shion, do you ever get lonely operating on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Why the sudden question?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's just that you seem to get along with those people. You're not indifferent about them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>There was this glint in your eyes when you were recounting your meetings with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's not the same as when you'd talk about how you seduced information out of an official, or coerced someone into complying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It feels like you genuinely enjoyed their company.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'm just thinking that you could open your heart more to others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We're only human, and everyone needs a little friendship here and there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Especially you, Shion. You've been tangled in webs of intrigue since we were children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You are a kind person with a good heart. I would hate to see you grow hollow from insincere interactions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>["A good heart"... Siegfried said that to me the first time we met, in the temple at Sakris Village.]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>[That was merely my cover story. My main objective was to make sure Soren was secured.]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>[And yet... Did I not enjoy their banter all the same, at the Slothstein tavern? Or the Professor's home?]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Perhaps you are right, Asuka.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I... suppose I do feel lonely at times. Sometimes it overwhelms me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>There were times when I felt I was but a single person against the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Times I dearly wish never to experience again...</td>
</tr>
