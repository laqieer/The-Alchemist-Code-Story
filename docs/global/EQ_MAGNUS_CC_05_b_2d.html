<td>001</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(I'm outnumbered, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(With Will and Magnus on my side, I can't lose! I just have to hold out a little longer!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wait... Isn't this...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That seed you gave me is starting to grow! You've gotta come see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ooh! Really? Show me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wow! It has sprouted, hasn't it? Great work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I was worried it'd never grow down here... It's like a miracle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>It's thanks to everyone that this little guy is growing so well! I can't wait to see what kinda flower it'll turn out to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(I have to protect that flower!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You should learn to keep your eye on the enemy, girl. Getting distracted could cost you your life, if you're not careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(There must be something I can do here! After all, there's nothing I can't do if I set my mind to it!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh? What's...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(One of the incantation tubes has broken! Water's flowing out of it... I can use this!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Enough games! Time to fin—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Take that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Graaargh! Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>These were the first incantation gears I ever made. I installed them in Real Heaven to provide people with water and electricity. To help us survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Is that a...hose? Hah! What're you planning to do, splash me with water?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Now, I'm going to use this incantation gear to defend my hometown!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hah! You're bluffing. Water isn't going to save you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh, but...it's not just water, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>After all, if you don't draw the cards of fate yourself, you'll never get anywhere in life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Aaaaaarghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ryui! You okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You sure took your time, Magnus! What sort of mentor stands back and lets his apprentice get driven into a corner?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Sorry. I had my hands full.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Still, I'm almost surprised you didn't try to finish the job all by yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Why would I? We're in this together, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Glad to hear it. Good work wrapping things up here, by the way. It should all be over now. We've got everyone else taking part in the purge restrained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Already?! How about the townspeople? Are they all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You can count on Will to make sure of that—it's kind of his field of expertise. Just sit down for a minute. You deserve a little rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I have to say, that was a pretty interesting trick you pulled. I never would've thought to use a hose to spray electrified water...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well, I was the one who installed those incantation gears. That's why I brought this with me—and it was a good thing I did, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Do you always carry around a hose and insulated gloves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Like I said before, it's best to be prepared for any situation. At least one of the items is bound to come in handy, and, so long as you have the proper tools, there's nothing you can't handle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hah. In your case, I don't doubt it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And so, the purge of Real Heaven came to an end before it had truly begun, and was quietly buried from public sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I can't believe this! I have to write a statement of regret, and I'm on archive organization duty for weeks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Good! Now you're officially a troublemaker, just like us. Welcome to the team.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Way I see it, you got off light. You owe Captain Kaya and Othima big time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>As for us, we just happened to be there. Bit of an unfortunate coincidence, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Which makes it justified self-defense that we got involved. At least, that's the story our beloved captain made the higher-ups swallow. And that's why you're dealing with books and letters instead of, y'know, getting dismissed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The fact that we even need an excuse to protect a town and its people to begin with is hard to swallow, huh? So much for the allies of justice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I agree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>But that's enough chitchat! Are you two still working on your apology statements?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hurry up and get them done so you can help me organize these documents!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well, it's a big job, and it ought to be done right. So if anyone's going to take care of it, Ryui, I think it should be you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's not a job, it's our punishment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Whatever. Anyway, it's not like I have anything to write. As far as I'm concerned, I've got nothing to apologize for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>And why're you asking me for help? I've helped you out enough already, haven't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yeah! Ditto!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Oh, don't start that again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>But you're right about one thing... You have helped me out a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Which is why...there's something you should know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What? Did you realize that there're things more important than filling your belly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>If so, I've got nothing left to teach you. My work here is done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Magnus...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Are you sure about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I am. The town's recovery efforts aren't making much progress, and my incantation gear could make all the difference.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I see. Still, I'm sure you could find a way to assist them using your current position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I thought about that, but then I realized something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I don't want them to be alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I want to be an ally of justice for Real Heaven. I want to help them like Magnus and Will helped me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Oh? And how do you plan to do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>First, I'm going to create a flower garden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I know it's a small change, but I really think it will make all the difference in lifting people's spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I think that's a wonderful idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Thank you. You know...there's no guarantee that something like this won't happen again. And if it did, I would always make the same choice, regardless of what the higher-ups said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I don't want to cause trouble for you or Mister Othima a third time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Captain Othima, you mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Oh, right. Though, you know, I think he's stopped correcting me over it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You will be missed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Hee hee. You think so? Oh! By the way, if you ever want to update or mod Antie, come see me anytime!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>In fact, my doors will always be open to you, whatever you need! And, for you, all prices are negotiable! Know that you have a friend in Real Heaven, if ever you're in need!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I appreciate that. Thank you, Ryui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>No, thank you! For everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You've changed, Ryui. Or should I say...grown?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I honestly can't thank you enough, Mister Othima. You've done so much for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>So, if ever you're in need of a new client, come see me! I'll be sure to give you a good deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>And last, but certainly not least: Magnus, Will... Thank you for being my mentors, through thick and thin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I hope you'll still get your work done, even without me there to remind you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>No promises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Really? What are our hard-earned taxes paying for, then? Come on, you know you can get your work done fast enough that you'd have plenty of time to slack off afterwards!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You really are the biggest pair of good-for-nothing lazybones I've ever met! You never take anything seriously, and I honestly don't understand why they keep you around, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Still, there's no one I'd rather have watch my back when I'm fighting for the justice of the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Thank you for helping me protect my hometown...and learn to love it again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Have fun out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>You'll be a great role model for that town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Haha. I'll do my best to make you proud. Well... See you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Will, Magnus... I'm glad I left her in your care. Make no mistake: You're the ones who put that sunny smile on her face. Give yourselves a pat on the back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Thanks to you...she's going to do just fine out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Are you going to miss her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I dunno about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Besides, at the end of the day, she was too good for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I'm not sure I agree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Regardless, having watched the two of you over the course of your mentorship, I can honestly say that you have impressed me. You are surprisingly motivated when the cause suits you, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Haha. I have to say, the way you fought like vigilantes of justice was pretty inspiring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I'm planning on telling Monzein about it sometime over drinks—he'd get a real kick out of it. You should join us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Wait a sec... Were you watching us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Wouldn't you like to know? Keep up the good work, allies of justice. Hmhm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>They're not going to let this one go, are they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>You've gotta be kidding me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Well, whatever. Guess we might as well act the part and get our work done for a change. Wouldn't want to give our friend down in "Heaven" nightmares.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Heheh. If she found out we were slacking off, she'd probably burst in here and demand that we pay her back all the taxes we wasted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I wouldn't put it past her. But...let's just enjoy tonight. We can start on our backlog of work tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>So, what're you in the mood for? Blackjack, or poker?</td>
