<td>Well... It doesn't look like I can possibly avoid that.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Guh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Why? Why did you shoot her?! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>So that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So that the world will be...as the Infinite Serpent wishes... That is the will...of Superbia Belt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You critically wounded my sister for such a shallow reason?! You... You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Haah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'll...avenge Emmel. I'll—! What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Uh-oh! This isn't good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No... No! This isn't what I— Ack! I can't control it! Why is my power reacting like this?! I can't hold it back anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Because that's...what your power exists for. It's behaving...exactly as it was...always meant to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>All is proceeding...as the Infinite Serpent planned. You must be so angry right now...so repulsed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But that's good. Use that anger...to rend these lands asunder...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We have prepared ourselves...for your judgment. Now accept your fate...Child of God.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ngh.... Aaaargh...!</td>

<td>Nimul...</td>

<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No! I'm too late! But I can't let the last bud of hope be nipped off here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What the...?! Is it an earthquake?! And the winds are stronger than ever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Quick, everyone behind my shield! There's too much debris in the air; you won't be safe out in the open!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There's so much magil flowing everywhere! What in the world is happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Come on, Nyx! We're too exposed here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Whoa! What the heck's happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This magil...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's the same as it was that day in Gula Belt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Is this the Light of Judgment?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I... I think it is! The meter reading is exactly the same!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Does that mean God's angry with this Belt Region as well?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No, this is different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The time has come, Pursuers. It has begun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Looks like my son has done his old father proud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hmm? Don't tell me you're feeling guilty! There's no good use for such emotions, you know. Best just to discard them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The biggest obstacle to the Ceremony of Creation is the wall of corruption that envelops everything we know: the Shell of the World.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We had no way of breaking that shell. That's why the dragons lost all hope of renewing the world, and the humans were forced to live amidst all this corruption and sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But then, they arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>They, with the same powers and capabilities as those we call gods, arrived in these forbidden lands where the world is destined to be leveled and built anew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And now all that remains is for the people of Pride to be sacrificed by his hands—by the merciless hands of God.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Everything has gone just as we planned it, Bianca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Many people will die again, won't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I wonder if there ever will come a time when these sacrifices really won't be necessary anymore...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That's for God to decide. We are only to follow the fate he has provided us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Nimul...</td>
