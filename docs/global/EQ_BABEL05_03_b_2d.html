<td>I'm sorry for getting you involved in this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh, there's no need for that. This sort of thing is a part of the humdrum of my everyday life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>R-really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm happy to have another person who I can talk to without fear of keeping my ears covered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It must be uncomfortable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Isn't there someone who you look forward to talking to, regardless of what should happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Y-yes! There is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>As there is for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sophia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I also feel that I should like us to have such a bond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm...not great at talking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This is the first time I've been out and about in ages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Albea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Y-yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's been a while since I left my own village and went into the city, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Taking awfully long naps each day and ending up lazing around at home all day afterward...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I-I don't exactly oversleep, I just...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We each have our own preferred pace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I say that we two proceed at a leisurely pace, as fellow homebodies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Homebodies...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Did I misspeak? I am sorry if I offended you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh, no. Not at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm probably a lot more of a shut-in than you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I assumed so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Neither you, nor I, have a thing to worry about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Please feel free to come and see me any time you like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The snow has melted, hasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>As for the path to your brother, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Albea, if your brother will do as he sees fit...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You just don't learn, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Much like how you will do as you see fit...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You got a new set of cards? Nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Then perhaps...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You know I never lose.</td>
