<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You! Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I-I think so. Who are you? Are you alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I am. I am alive. My name's Kamui. What's yours? Are you all alone out here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>In the factory over there... There's a grown-up, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I-I was looking for something to eat, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Will you take me to them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Mister!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>There you are! I told you to stay inside these walls! You... Wait, who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Are the Jam not here? What is this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The Jam? You mean those goo monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm not sure why, but they seem to avoid this building.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>They avoid this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Anyway, let's get inside. Those monsters' shrieks freak me out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Is this...limestone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yeah, it's one of the ingredients for making mortar. This place used to deal with building materials. It's a bit dusty, but it's secure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I owe you. I'm—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ah, yeah, I know I asked outside, but I sort of figured. You're with the Liberation Army, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. Does that not bother you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Why should it? There are monsters crawling about right outside. We humans gotta stick together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Besides, it's about time we got moving from this place. We ran out of food a little while ago. Where are your friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We got separated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, that's unfortunate...for all of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I was hoping you would have some means of helping us out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>How long has the royal capital been like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The monsters started roaming around last night, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We have had a lot of people going missing at night. It could have been going on for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Are there any others here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Nah, just me and the kid. No relation, but, I couldn't just abandon a child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I mean...not after one of those monsters took mine from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Anyway, if we coop up here, we'll just be waiting to starve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Can you fight? I was wondering if we could ask you to be our bodyguard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You mean, you know of a way out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yeah. This royal capital was built on what used to be a mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>There are still a few tunnels that people used as little passages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>And the Jam aren't in them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I wouldn't know about that, but there should at least be less then there are on the streets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I've seen those things all over the place, but I haven't seen one crawl out of the tunnels yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I see. Well then, I'll accept your request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Really? Thank you. Hold on, let me just go get the kid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hm... Why do the Jam avoid this building?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I feel like I'm missing something, but...what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's so dark!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Stay close! It's like a maze in here. If we deviate from the right path, even I'll get lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wait for me! C-can we light a torch, please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No way! If we burn a torch in this small space, we'll burn through our air and suffocate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Whoa! What the–?! Is that some sort of magic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Some thing like that. Is this the right way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>No doubt. I'll lead the way ahead. Would I be able to hold that light?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Yes, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Um... Mister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Th-thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>We still have a long way to go. Try not to push yourself too hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Just as I thought, there aren't any of the Jam here, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Grrrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I forgot this place was closed off because monsters sometimes nest in here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Get back! I'll take care of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You got it! Come on, missy! This way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>B-be careful, mister!</td>
