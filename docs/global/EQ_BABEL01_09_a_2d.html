<td>It's my fault that he... No! Sir Gerald!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>There's no need to be so noisy. Hyaaaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!!! Because of me, you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It wasn't... My body just moved on its own. It's nothing you need to apologize for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Sir Gerald... You... How could you risk your life like that for a therian like me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Tch... How dare you...question my honor. Therian...human... It doesn't matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The vow I took...isn't as half-hearted as all that! I will protect the...happiness of everyone...in this world! Young, old, man, woman...human...or therian!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Sir Gerald!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The person I respected more than anyone else in this world... That is the justice he taught me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>He put his life on the line for the therians! Even as he stood on the brink of death, he celebrated the fact that he was able to protect all of them! Even though he lost his life in the process!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A proud man...he never gave up on his code...of honor. My father...never gave up...anything except...his own life...in order to protect...someone else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I won't forget that. His legacy has always been mine to inherit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I may have held a grudge against the therians once...for being the reason he was gone...but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...I let go of it the day I heard you say...the same words Vettel once said...to me. That is why I tell you now... I respect you...and recognize you for all that you can...and will do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Sir Gerald!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You hold...within you the...call to...justice...that I am drawn...to support. That...is why I had to put my...life...on the line...to protect you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No... I wanted to. I wanted...to put my life on the line to...protect the iron will...that you hold within you. I will not let you die!</td>

<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sir Gerald!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You... You will become the bridge...to a future in which therians...and humans...can live happily together...right? So...live! And...nngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't speak! Save your breath!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What theâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Um, so... Hypothetically, it might be possible that I missed one of the assassins, and uh... They may have lit the forest on fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Why would they do that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I mean, just throwing out some ideas, but maybe as a last resort to kill Gerald? I mean, we could sit around debating that all day, but uh... We should probably leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh no... You're leaving already? You won't even stay for tea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You! You're the presence...I've been sensing all this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh dear. You sensed me? My, my, my... As expected of Ironheart Gerald of the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...It seems like you have me at a disadvantage. I suppose you're here to take my head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Urgh. Who the heck are you? You're kind of grossing me out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hm... It doesn't really matter. I mean, you're going to die here, and dead men can tell no tales.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Still, I must commend you. That you were able to get all the way here is quite a feat. What I have seen so far exceeds even the most impressive of rumors about your abilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I've heard especially good things about Sunbright Vettel and...you, Ironheart Gerald.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hmph... I don't know what you're...after, but...I'm not simply going to roll over and die for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Sir Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>So you are the summoner of these immortal soldiers. Nina, at the ready! If we defeat her, we could completely change the tide of this battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Roger! Gerald...did you see that light just now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yeah... Every time she summons something, that ring flashes with light. It looks like it could be what she uses to channel her summoning powers. Aim for that ring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What are the two of you whispering about? Weren't you going to attack me? Or have you simply given up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I suppose I could make that work. I could watch you burn instead. Oh, yes... I think I could enjoy that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>After all, it isn't as if I can just let you go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Here she comes!</td>
