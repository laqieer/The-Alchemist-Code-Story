<td>Ahh! What a beautiful morning!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey! How's it going? You should definitely come check out the club activities going on this weekend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We'll be doing some joint practice with the brass band. You're welcome to join the club, if it interests you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ooh! Sounds great! I'll come take a peek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Good morning. Have you finished your research?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, yeah. At least... I think I did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well, you're welcome to visit the library whenever you'd like—so long as you keep the volume to a minimum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Haha. Will do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Good. I hope to see you there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Y'know, I was so nervous when I transferred here, but now I'm making friends things are starting to... Huh? Who's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Were they being mean to you again? Oh, I wish I could remain by your side at all times...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Is that girl talking to a cat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hey! What're you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Aaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>She ran away... What's up with her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You and Sol aren't the only transfer students here, you know. Though to be fair, she's an even rarer sight around the school than he is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Even I tire of reading nothing but philosophy textbooks sometimes. I take a boring class or two, when it suits me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh... So there are even more transfer students? What was that girl's name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Zwei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Zwei? I feel like I've heard that name somewhere before, but I can't seem to place it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So you want to go searching for transfer students again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I don't have any business with her... I just get the feeling that I should talk to her a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I see. If it were me, I wouldn't bother... but I suppose you're a different sort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh? But you've been all up in my business ever since I transferred! Are we talking about the same Kaya, here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ever since you transferred? But you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah! We've been hanging out since day one! I don't know what I'd do without you, Kaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Kaya's Affection Level...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hm... All right. Where should we start looking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Aaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>S-sorry. I should've been looking where I was going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I-it's okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh? You're...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Stop looking me up and down! What are you thinking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I-it's nothing like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Anyway... it's nice to meet you, Klima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hold on. Why were you staring at me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Look, I didn't mean to! I just felt like I knew your face from somewhere, but I guess not. It must've been my imagination playing tricks on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well... All right, then. Are you on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yep. I was just— Wait. That's weird... I could've sworn I had someone with me. Didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh? Don't ask me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Well, anyway... I'm looking for Zwei. Have you seen her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Not today, but I often see her playing with cats in those flowerbeds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Really?! Then I guess I'll stick around here a little longer, see if she shows up... Do you mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>No... But I'll be leaving once I finish watering the plants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's fine! I won't keep you here. Just let me know if you need any help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hee hee... Thanks. I just might.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hey... Are you a transfer student?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yep! I feel like I'm finally settling in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>That's good. Well, I'm usually in this area... Come again sometime. If I'm not here, just wait for me. I'm never far away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I will! And I'll help you water the flowers next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Thanks. See you around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>"Just wait for me?" Why does that sound so familiar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hmm... I appreciate the offer and all, but it'd be pretty painful to wait for someone when you're not even sure they'll turn up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Suddenly, you hear a rustling noise among the bushes in the flowerbeds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(That must be her!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Meow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Oh. Looks like the cat arrived first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Mreow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It's coming this way! Maybe it thinks I'm Zwei? No... Cats aren't that stupid. What should I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Prrr... Prrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Get away from her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>H-huh? This cat approached me first... Oh, hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You're the girl who was talking to the cat this morning! Zwei, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I don't have a clue who you are, but I'm telling you to step away from that cat right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>C'mon, she just fell asleep on my lap! It'd be criminal to move her now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I don't believe it... She's warmed up to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I suppose that means you can't be a bad person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You see... She's been getting bullied lately, the poor thing, so I'm a little cautious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What?! There are animal abusers here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Oh! No. Sorry, I should've been more clear. She's getting bullied by other animals—terrible, mean animals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>That's still sad! I can't let that slide! We should teach them a lesson so this cat can chill with you in peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Are you... offering to help me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
</tr>
