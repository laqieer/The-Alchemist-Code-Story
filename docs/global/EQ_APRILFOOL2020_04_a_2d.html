<td>"Just wait for me?" Why does that sound so familiar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hmm... I appreciate the offer and all, but it'd be pretty painful to wait for someone when you're not even sure they'll turn up.</td>

<td>What?! There are animal abusers here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zwei.png" alt="Zwei" height="128"><br>Zwei</td>
<td>Oh! No. Sorry, I should've been more clear. She's getting bullied by other animals—terrible, mean animals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p_name></td>
<td>That's still sad! I can't let that slide! We should teach them a lesson so this cat can chill with you in peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/zwei.png" alt="Zwei" height="128"><br>Zwei</td>
<td>Are you... offering to help me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p_name></td>
<td>Of course!</td>
