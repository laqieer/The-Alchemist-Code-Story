<td>Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This pressure is intense. Magil is supposed to be formless, but it feels like an iron wall pushing back on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But I must endure this. This is what Ouroboros had been containing all this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Perhaps I can do something with Nero's power, since it shares the same source as Ouroboros'...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But you've reached your limit. How long do you think you can possibly last if you push things any farther?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>With all of the contracts you've already pledged, your fate is as good as sealed as it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Any more, and you'll—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You really want to know how long I can hold out? That much should be obvious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I will endure until Nimul completes the creation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I will now access the interior of the tower. I will unravel the mysteries of the dragons with my own two hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So...this is the heart of Grand Excelsior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Correct. And this is to be the final resting place of my soul's core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That voice, and this magil... Ouroboros?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes, and no. I am the one you've opposed. I am the one you call God.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>And yet, I am also not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I cast shadows upon the earth and give them self-awareness. They are I, and yet they are not. I am and am not the last vestige of the dragons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Do you intend to stop me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I am only here to observe. That is my purpose; why I was born, and why I exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>There is presently a need for more accurate information and more precise calculations to complete the reconstruction of this planet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I am the ground, the sea, the air, and life itself. I have memory of every system that has ever existed, and I am the record of that existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Are you saying I should reference that record?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>There is no need. I will simply propose the proper seeds for the next creation. That is the sole reason I was made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>All right, then. I want to know everything you have to tell me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The Dragon Realm is shared amongst us. Close your eyes. I will engrave the results of my calculations and observances directly into your mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This is...the entire world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The world we were born into, where we struggled to live day by day, and traversed from one realm to the next in search of a better future... And it's all this small?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Correct. The human race thrives in extremely limited numbers upon only a fraction of the seven Belt Regions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So that should be the first order of business, then. To spread out farther, in order to become a more prosperous species.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Water is the source of life. There should be vast oceans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>And the lands upon these oceans should strike a balance between abundance and harshness, to inspire human ingenuity and resourcefulness without quashing it or creating complacence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Great forests can be used to harbor life, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>All of the Belt Regions should be unified into a single continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Let's put an end to the age of sin alone trapping the people of each land in isolation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Lastly...how will you determine the new Truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>New Truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yes. Just as was ordered the usurpation of sin amongst humans in this world of mine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Just as the dragons forced the world into a shell to hold it together as it began crumbling beneath their talons...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What incorruptible Truth will you write upon your world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...How about...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That should be the bulk of it taken care of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I just hope that young Sulva is safe and sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>He was a bit overzealous, wasn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Considering the situation, I'd say he acted just as he should've.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Anyway, what's next? We should be able to scale the tower now, if we wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Whoa! Is this an earthquake?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No, it's...a huge pulse of magil, shaking the ground?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Shaking the world, is more like it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Guess the ceremony's already begun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Urgh... Ahh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The corruption just keeps getting worse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I can sense that Ouroboros has been defeated, too. So what's causing it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>A-aaahh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I've reached my capacity as the Vessel of Purification. If the corruption keeps increasing here, I don't think I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>No! That doesn't matter. I'll keep fulfilling my duty for as long as I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I have to keep going. I can't stop until Nimul concludes the creation of the new world. I can't stop until he fulfills his dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I must contain all of the corruption here. I have to cleanse the sins of that stone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If my Spiritbonding is limited—if my power as the Vessel of Purification is not enough—then I'll just have to tap into the power Nimul shared with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I, too, am an Alchemist now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If you infuse it with the power born from a true desire to change the world, then yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I believe that this power can change the world. I know it can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I am not just fulfilling the role I was given. That's not why I want to protect this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I chose this path myself. I accept this way of fighting...this way of living! I accept all of it. It's the path of healing for this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>So...let me hear your voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Where...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>We finally meet, Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>So, you are Emmel. The sacrifice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I am. That's the path I chose, but not because I thought I could change the world on my own. I had something I wanted to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Why have you pulled me back from the brink? The creation has already begun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>The world will be saved, whether or not you expend further efforts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I know. But...the world I want to save is a world with Nimul still in it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Seeing him thrive, and smile... That is the world, to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>A human body simply cannot withstand the burden of creating everything anew. The desire to bring a new world into being is, by its very nature, an act of self-sacrifice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I understand. But I wish to give my life in his place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You wish to use Alchemy to sacrifice yourself, to save the very person ushering in this new world order?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I do. Changing the world was never something I believed I could do on my own. So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Could you lend me your power, just as Bianca entrusted hers to Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What you suggest is tantamount to madness. To accept my power would be to surrender yourself to the Truth of the world that was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>That would mean your soul being rejected by the pull of the new world. There would be no place for you within its torus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>But that's the only Alchemy at my disposal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Ouroboros. Would you join me in watching over the new world that Nimul is creating?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Very well, child of the old order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>396</td>
<td>You may live on as a sacrifice. It is a strong decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>And until such time as this new world falls to despair, I shall join you in watching over it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I think I've finally gotten the hang of it now...my Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>It's different from Nimul's. This power is intended to prevent change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>A day may come when someone is led astray by Alchemy's potential. The power I have can lead them back onto the straight and narrow through love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>"I am...Unifier of the Seven Gates!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Humans begot despair, grief, and rage. And we've endured a painful, difficult punishment for them ever since.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>But it will be fine. All can now be forgiven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I will take on all of that corruption...all of that sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I... I made it in time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Ignacio?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Where's Nimul? And what's happening with the Ceremony of Creation...with the fight against God?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>...I see. I understand now. It's all so clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Ignacio, I have a favor to ask of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Someone's purified all of the corruption. Or rather, it seems as if they're attempting to seal it away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>But there won't be enough time to seal away all of it—not enough time to avert absolute calamity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>How can you say that so calmly?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I am merely assessing the situation. If you wish to buy time for the sealing to complete, however, there might just be a way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Is there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>In this tower lies an artificial Dragon Realm formed by the merging of the seven cores of the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>And, of course, there is a part of me in there as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>What in blazes are you on about?! Explain it so I can understand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>I mean to say that in this place, and in this moment now that my princess has gone to rest, the Truth of the world can be...bent, a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>All of the corruption in this place, including the remains of the dragon princess, can be carted off to another dimension—the Fringe Dimension.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Carted off? Are you saying you can...take it there? But, won't that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>The current state of the world is the result of the sins committed by dragons, not humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>The time has finally come for us to atone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Which means the time has come for us to part, Seeker of Truth and Protector of Devotion. Even should reality not change, there will be no coming back from this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>But as the last of the dragons, it was a pleasure to see things through to the end with you—with humanity. I thank you for attending to my needs...to our needs...so thoroughly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Zafeiris, wait—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>"Fringe Dimensional Art, Nero. Activation."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I hereby give all I have to take this corruption to the Fringe Dimension.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Please, Zafeiris! You don't have to do this! Live on, for me, and for everyone else as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I'm sorry. Please forgive me, my beloved child. Farewell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Zafeiris, you aren't—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Ngh—aaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Stand down, Waginau! You'll get pulled into the spell, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>What else am I supposed to do?! Do you think I'm going to just stand here and let you end it like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Wagi...nau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>You're the one who showed me! The end of the dragons! What they were thinking... What they wanted... What they entrusted to us, and how they fell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>You alone are left, and yet...you're going to throw that all away?! You're going to break your promise to her?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Waginau...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I can't let it end like this, Zafeiris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>You promised her! You promised!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>That you'd see things through to the very end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>"Adhere to the dark commandments!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Are you trying to open the path to the Fringe Dimension in my stead?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Wait, Waginau! There's no way a human body can withstand this power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>You've only been able to realize the miracles you have through my control and your offerings!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Don't you dare underestimate humans, Zafeiris! Now, listen up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>There's nothing worse than a parent who makes their own child cry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Waginau...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I pledge everything! I pledge my entire world! Pure and blackened soul, please grant me the power to save another!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Lastly, I give the gift of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Anyone and everyone is to have the power to change the world. Happiness and prosperity are rights that all shall be afforded, in equal measure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>That is the world I envision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>It is possible. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>You have only ever truly seen people deal with crisis through fear and defiance. In times of peace and plenty, how will they stand against sin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>It'll be fine. I know it will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>I believe that people can reflect on their faults. They can make the choice to live differently, so as not to repeat the same mistakes again and again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>I see. If the creator of the new world believes so, then I shall accept it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>I do believe. I'm sure of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>But there is one thing you should bear in mind, child of man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>And what would that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>No matter how righteous and pure the lives of these humans may be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>There are some Truths of nature that simply cannot be changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Ghhk... I think I've reached my limit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>But that should complete the process of creation. Now all that's left is to get out of here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Rrg, my legs... I-I think I overdid it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Nimul. You're back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Yeah. It's done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>What's that shaking?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>The tower has served its purpose and is now falling apart. We should get as far away from it as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>But...Emmel and the others... We've got to make sure that they're okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>We can pick them up on our way down. No one wants any more sacrifices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Waginau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Umm... It's probably nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>(Did Waginau...always have such a stern look to him?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Waginau, did you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Protecting you is my duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>...All right. I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Emmel! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Ah, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>It's over, right? I'm so glad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>It is, but this tower's falling apart! You've got to get moving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Wait... What happened to you? What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>I'm staying here. There are still things for me to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>What kind of things could you possibly need to do in a collapsing tower?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Well... This stone is called Grand Excelsior, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>It has the ability to absorb the sins of humans...and it's still continuing to do that, even now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Someone has to stay here to ensure that it never stops, so that another age of corruption never comes to pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Emmel... You can't... Please...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>I have to, Nimul. I need to make sure the sins of the old world don't seep into the new one you've created.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>But then it won't mean anything! Nothing will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Everything that we've gone through...and you'll still be a sacrifice in the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>You have to survive, Emmel! That was the impetus for my dream from the start!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>There has to me another way, okay? So come with us! Please! Please, Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>I can't. This is the path I've chosen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>...Wait! Now that Alchemy can be tapped into by anyone, I can use it to take your place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Nimul, I'm so sorry... Ignacio, if you'd please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Hyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Em...ulgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Are you really sure about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>I am. Thank you for coming this far with us. You helped so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Never would I have imagined that someone like me would be able to see all this through, while you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Don't think like that. It pleases me to know that you'll live on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Zafeiris...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>You could tell in one look, huh? I wonder how long it'll take the others to figure it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>I'm sure no one will protest even once they do. They'll realize that this is what Waginau wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>It may still be a shock to the system for many of them, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Zafeiris, I'd like you to look after Nimul from here on out, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>That was what Waginau lived for, wasn't it? All he wanted was for you and Nimul to be happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>So in his honor, I will gladly inherit that duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Then I bid you all good night. I will always, always be here, praying for happiness in each and every one of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>...It's begun to fall. How do we get out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Hey there! You all okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>You're the only ones left in there! Do you think you can make the jump onto the ship?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>If you can't, I'll help make it so you can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>What about the others? What about my sister?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>We've already helped everyone else, you dummy! That's why we said you're the only ones left!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>There was a sudden lull in the magil, so we took that opportunity to pick, uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>...to pick everybody up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>Anyway, what are you waiting for?! Just hop on, already! We've got to get out of here, fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Everything's changing around us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>It's not just the view that's going haywire. The nature of the magil here is changing, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>I presume this is...the creation of the new world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>Oh! This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Absolutely cannot believe you made it out of there alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>So this is the world you dreamed of, Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>A vast land full of life and nature... It is certainly idyllic, in its own way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>Mrng...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>How can I just...accept this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>After all that, Emmel ends up bearing the burden of the creation on her own. It's exactly the outcome I've been fighting so hard to prevent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>And the worst part is, I failed in eliminating both the Cursed Beasts and the corruption from the world. All I did is postpone the inevitable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>Is this really the world I've always dreamed of? It feels like such a...hollow victory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>How long must people continue to sacrifice themselves for some greater good? How long must people barter with their lives and livelihoods?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>Emmel...! Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>How...? Why?! How could you...? Emmel! Agh! Aaaah! Nng... Why...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>But there is one thing you should bear in mind, child of man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>No matter how righteous and pure the lives of these humans may be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>260</td>
<td>Ha! I knew it. You don't much care for that name, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>261</td>
<td>Honestly. I only agreed to take it because I, too, wanted to help ensure that the world remembered its saviors, Nimul and Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>262</td>
<td>I still don't get why we have to be their representatives, though. I'm hardly tall enough for the role, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>263</td>
<td>That's what we all agreed on, Eulalia. Even the leaders of the former Belt Regions were on board with the plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>264</td>
<td>Yes, yes. I do understand. After such sudden and radical changes to the world, it's vital to have proper representation to help guide the masses. Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>265</td>
<td>You have to remember, barely any of the townspeople can even recall what either Nimul or Emmel looks like. It's important, for the sake of history, that we give faces to the names.</td>

<tr>
<td>266</td>
<td>A simple name on paper is quickly forgotten, but a picture is worth a thousand words, as they say.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>268</td>
<td>We all do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>269</td>
<td>But he simply wasn't prepared to accept the outcome. He wanted to believe that there's some way to save Emmel. And if there is, he'll move heaven and earth—again—to find it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>270</td>
<td>To tell you the truth, I feel a bit left out, as it stands to be quite the adventure all its own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>271</td>
<td>And in the end, no one could keep him from going. He is the creator of Alchemy, after all.</td>
</tr>

<td>Not to mention the "Child of God," and founder of this whole new world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>You have plans for it, don't you?</td>

<tr>
<td>275</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>276</td>
<td>The real Emmel pledged her life to seal away that stone...that amalgamation of all the cores of the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>277</td>
<td>The Grand Excelsior, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>278</td>
<td>Ah, that. Yes, I do have something in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>279</td>
<td>I was thinking, perhaps we humans could rebuild the tower from the ground up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>280</td>
<td>And then we enshrine Grand Excelsior within it. It symbolizes all that was sacrificed—all the people who were lost—for our current time of peace, so it would seem a fitting monument.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>281</td>
<td>That's a good idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>282</td>
<td>As for the name... I thought we might call it the Tower of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>283</td>
<td>Okay, perfect! The motorcycle maintenance is all finished!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>284</td>
<td>Bit surprised you'd be asking me to do this, though, if I'm being honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>285</td>
<td>Well... Space-Time Manipulation doesn't work all too well in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>286</td>
<td>We can still use it, but we can't seem to travel as far as we used to with it. It's much more limited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>287</td>
<td>I feel like that whole branch of magic is shrinking. In the future, it may only be possible to manipulate time for a single person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>288</td>
<td>Guess changing the Truth of the world just has those kinds of side effects, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>289</td>
<td>Though, yours truly might've just come up with a loophole to get around that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>290</td>
<td>Hmm. So you're going on a trip, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>291</td>
<td>Yep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>292</td>
<td>Nyx has been saying that we really need to seize the day, since our time on this earth is limited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>293</td>
<td>And he thinks it'd be a shame to spend what little time we've got just fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>294</td>
<td>I always knew he had kind of a pessimistic streak in him, but that in particular really struck a chord with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>295</td>
<td>I decided then and there that I want to show him...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>296</td>
<td>That time is truly infinite. And that there's a meaning to all of our fighting, somewhere out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>297</td>
<td>So I'm setting off to find proof of that for him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>298</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>299</td>
<td>Well, if that's what you've decided, far be it from me to stop you! Just...be careful out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>300</td>
<td>Heh. No promises!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>301</td>
<td>So what about you, Adaleigh? Seems like you've properly settled down here. You cool with just planting roots, after all that adventuring?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>302</td>
<td>Far as I'm concerned, this is an adventure in itself. I plan to analyze and research the world from here, and develop new technology to help make life a little better for everybody.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>303</td>
<td>I'll be doing my part to make this new world flourish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>304</td>
<td>If I'm being perfectly honest, I kind of thought you'd be going with Nimul on his quest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>305</td>
<td>He's still out there looking for a way to save Emmel, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>306</td>
<td>He is. But I think it's okay for me to sit that out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>307</td>
<td>Because I genuinely believe, one way or another, that Emmel will come back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>308</td>
<td>I don't know when, or even if I'll still be alive at that point, but she'll be back. Mark my words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>309</td>
<td>I know in my heart she will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>310</td>
<td>And if this world were somehow worse than the Belt Regions when she does, I don't know how I'd ever be able to look her in the eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>311</td>
<td>So that's why I'm sticking around here and trying to make the world a little better. I want to make sure that when Nimul and Emmel return...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>312</td>
<td>...they'll know that everything they did really meant something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>313</td>
<td>Makes sense to me. Give it your best, you lovelorn old fool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>314</td>
<td>You know, you should try falling in love sometime, too. You don't want to wind up an old maid like that mentor of yours, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>315</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>316</td>
<td>Hey. What's with the quiet treatment all of a sudden? It was a joke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>317</td>
<td>Just thinking. You never know what that might do to a girl like me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>318</td>
<td>Hmm? Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>319</td>
<td>I'm just saying, the witch's curse runs pretty deep. Anyhow, I should get going! Catch ya 'round!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>320</td>
<td>Wait. You're kinda scaring me. Am I gonna get cursed?! Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>321</td>
<td>Hmm... Suddenly, my ears are burning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>322</td>
<td>Are you all right, Ambrosia? You should take some time to rest and eat a proper meal. Your research can wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>323</td>
<td>Oh, please! Pretty sure it just means somebody's talking about me. I ought to curse them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>324</td>
<td>You really need to stop cursing people! Think of poor Minario.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>325</td>
<td>The motorcycle man? Ehh, he only got what was coming to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>326</td>
<td>Though I've kind of lost interest, at this point. Definitely have less energy to spare on cursing motorcycle men than I used to, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>327</td>
<td>Well, that's probably good, since it looks like things are going to be peaceful for some time to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>328</td>
<td>Yes, I suppose so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>329</td>
<td>I'm sorry I couldn't bring Quence back with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>330</td>
<td>Can't say I'm surprised. That's just the kind of person he was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>331</td>
<td>He always acted so self-important and haughty, and then to be more capable than me on top of that? Honestly, his very existence made me so mad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>332</td>
<td>Anyhow, I'm sure he had a grin on his face until the very end, didn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>333</td>
<td>He did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>334</td>
<td>Hmph. Of course he did. Showoff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>335</td>
<td>All that time as my senior apprentice, and he never once pushed himself to outrank me! He just went off and did his own crazy thing. And look where that got him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>336</td>
<td>All right. That should do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>337</td>
<td>Thank you, Yna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>338</td>
<td>No worries. This is my trade, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>339</td>
<td>So, you've yet to find Andechs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>340</td>
<td>That's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>341</td>
<td>I searched high and low for him until the point of no return for escaping the tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>342</td>
<td>I've gone back to search the surrounding area many times since the new creation, but have found neither hide nor hair of him. No body, no personal items... Nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>343</td>
<td>Strange. That does have some implications, though, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>344</td>
<td>Particularly when I consider his last message to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>345</td>
<td>I have a message from Andechs:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>346</td>
<td>"You've done so well. You're a truly wonderful, upstanding knight."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>347</td>
<td>He wanted to make sure I told you that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>348</td>
<td>As last messages go, that one just feels...sloppy. It's very uncharacteristic of him. So I choose to believe that he left it, knowing he'd be coming back. And I'm going to wait for him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>349</td>
<td>I'm certain he's still alive...somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>350</td>
<td>I think there's nothing wrong with believing that. This is a new world of hope, after all. Your faith may very well be what's keeping him going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>351</td>
<td>So what are your plans from here on out, Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>352</td>
<td>Well, there's this man I know. He blows through here from time to time like the wind in the fields. I've met him a few times since the new creation, but it's been quite a while since I last saw him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>353</td>
<td>So are you thinking of going off in search of him, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>354</td>
<td>Not exactly. See, whenever we did meet, we'd always talk about things like the fate of the world, developing our various skills, our families... You know, just catching up with each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>355</td>
<td>And I've come to really look forward to those little chats. I feel like if he had something new to say, he'd swing by again. So I plan to just keep living my life, and waiting for that next encounter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>356</td>
<td>I see. So just enjoying life, and the promises of tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>357</td>
<td>Yep, that's the long and the short of it. Though I do wonder about that other man, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>358</td>
<td>Not so sure I look forward to his next visit quite as much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>359</td>
<td>Welcome back, Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>360</td>
<td>Thank you. How have things been since my departure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>361</td>
<td>The blessings of Sephiron remain in our hearts and minds, and shall continue to dwell there even should the world change once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>362</td>
<td>It pleases me to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>363</td>
<td>Never forget that we Sephira are the rightful attendants of the Holy Order of Babel—the mediators of this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>364</td>
<td>In this role, we must always ensure our skills are well honed, without sacrificing our compassion. But we must also ensure we seize the day, and live for ourselves first and foremost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>365</td>
<td>Yes, sir! I shall take that to heart. For the Sephira, and all that we represent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>366</td>
<td>We couldn't find you this time, either... Just where are you, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>367</td>
<td>I can't fulfill Waginau's purpose without you. I hope that we'll be able to find you soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>368</td>
<td>...Mm, I mustn't give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>369</td>
<td>Through all his years, Waginau was led by the desire to bring happiness to Nimul and Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>370</td>
<td>So I will do the same. I will work to fill Waginau's shoes as best as I am able.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>371</td>
<td>At long last...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>372</td>
<td>I finally made it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>373</td>
<td>Though this is little more than a gate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>374</td>
<td>Grand Excelsior... Emmel, with all the Cursed Beast cores sealed away in her body...is no longer here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>375</td>
<td>She must be on the other side. But I no longer have the power to open that door.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>376</td>
<td>Too much of me went into the Ceremony of Creation. I have almost nothing left...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>377</td>
<td>No energy remaining to stand against the origin of the Cursed Beasts—the original sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>378</td>
<td>I am no longer able to save anyone or anything. This is all I yet have to give.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>379</td>
<td>Alchemy was meant to be a manifestation of the very will to change the world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>380</td>
<td>And yet, it was lacking something. It wasn't enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>397</td>
<td>I am but a single person with a dream—a single person who imagined a new world. And in the end, what I had to offer just wasn't enough to save it all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>398</td>
<td>If only I'd realized...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>381</td>
<td>The seven sins are not something to fight against. We need to accept them. We need the will to live with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>382</td>
<td>I fought and struggled through so much to change the world and bring about an auspicious future...but what I needed were seven wills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>383</td>
<td>As a result of my misguided actions, the world will surely fall into sin and corruption again. These Sacred Stones now scattered throughout the world stand as lures...temptations...invitations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>384</td>
<td>They will give birth to many a tragedy as history continues to be written. And yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>385</td>
<td>To whosoever inherits the art of Alchemy—the art to sculpt the future of mankind...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>386</td>
<td>I humbly implore that you please rescue my sister from her eternal darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>387</td>
<td>Time must always march on. Seasons come and go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>388</td>
<td>The seven Sacred Stones that appeared throughout the world would come to cast great shadows over human history, just as Nimul had predicted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>389</td>
<td>The shell of peace that had enveloped this world without sin would gradually be cracked and shattered by human will. And within that egg lay a new age of war and misery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>390</td>
<td>It is the dawn of the Alchemy Age. And in this midst of recurrent upheaval, humans have slowly forgotten about something very important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>391</td>
<td>It's the grave of the founder, Nimul. So this is where it's been hiding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>392</td>
<td>Upon it is inscribed, "Here, My Sins Are Sealed."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>399</td>
<td>Is this very inscription Alchemy? Is this gravestone itself a seal to protect this sinless land?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>400</td>
<td>No matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>393</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>401</td>
<td>I have my own goals. I wish to make use of the Alchemy of this holy place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>402</td>
<td>And I do so in the name of absolute justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>394</td>
<td>"Here, Our Sins Are Sealed. Such Is My Sin. And Such Is My Prayer."</td>
