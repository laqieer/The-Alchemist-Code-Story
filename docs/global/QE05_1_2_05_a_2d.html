<tr>
<td>Hisham</td>
<td>Oh, right. Um... By the way, Kamui... I kind of have a favor to ask!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hisham</td>
<td>I, um... I wanna go see the village I grew up in.</td>

<td>I... I remember now. My village was burned down by soldiers of Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hisham</td>
<td>They needed supplies to support the troops going to attack the Liberation Army stronghold nearby.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hisham</td>
<td>They were especially interested in the village's well, our water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hisham</td>
<td>But that well was our lifeline... Without it, we all would have died anyway. That is why everyone laid their lives down to protect it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hisham</td>
<td>What choice did we have but to die even in an effort to live?</td>

<td>I already know that...there is no one left there for me.</td>

<tr>
<td>Hisham</td>
<td>The only thing I can do now is at least give them proper burials.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ishid.png" alt="Isidore" height="128"><br>Isidore</td>

<td>Ha. You never change.</td>

<td>Yeesh. You know that Miss Malta complains about your shamelessness all the time, right?</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ishid.png" alt="Isidore" height="128"><br>Isidore</td>
