<td>Welcome home, Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ah, you're still awake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yeah. I'm feeling wide awake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Go to sleep, Hisham. Otherwise you'll end up missing breakfast again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, right. Um... By the way, Kamui... I kind of have a favor to ask!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I, um... I wanna go see the village I grew up in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I... I remember now. My village was burned down by soldiers of Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>They needed supplies to support the troops going to attack the Liberation Army stronghold nearby.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They were especially interested in the village's well, our water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But that well was our lifeline... Without it, we all would have died anyway. That is why everyone laid their lives down to protect it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What choice did we have but to die even in an effort to live?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I already know that...there is no one left there for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The only thing I can do now is at least give them proper burials.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I see. Hisham... Let's go to your village, then, to pay your people their final respects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Thank you, Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Have you finished your preparations?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yep! I've got everything I need to cross the desert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Good. Thenâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Why, hello there! Where might you two be heading?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Isidore?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I heard from Malta that it's not safe out there, so I've decided to join you as a bodyguard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Is it really alright for the head of the warriors to be away from the village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Eh, it should be fine. Until matters come to a head, all we have to do is train and chase beasts off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Besides, Malta asked me to come. What was I gonna do, say no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ha. You never change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Of course! My love for Malta is the driving force in my life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yeesh. You know that Miss Malta complains about your shamelessness all the time, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Let us go quickly, before the sun goes down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Wait, wait! You were joking, though, right? Right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ahem. So, about Hisham's village... Do you two know where it is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, those mountains... I distinctly remember a place with the same mountain view just south of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes, and the area around here is starting to look a little familiar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Grrrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Monsters? Here? Hisham, get back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>O-okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We've been surrounded, but we shouldn't have any problems with this many. Let's show them they picked on the wrong people today, Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
