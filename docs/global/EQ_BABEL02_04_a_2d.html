<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Sir Zahar, Hero of the Holy Guard, it is an honor to fight by your side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I am grateful for your warm hospitality. Allow me to return the favor by turning myself into an instrument of war for the glory of Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Your words give us strength! For the glory of Wratharis and our fellow brothers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Zahar, am I missing something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Why would we be welcomed by the people of Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This is something I put in motion years prior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I've always intended to leave the accursed Holy Guard and defect to Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So I assembled warriors of like mind to escort Letitia over to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I had no idea you'd been planning this all along. Who is she exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>She's a trusted companion who I've known for as long as I can remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A trusted companion...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(Zahar's trusted companion? Argh! My left eye! Are you trying to warn me about her?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Corvus, how do you feel about devoting your talents here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No man would stand your equal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I would have it no other way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Corvus, Letitia, our paths begin here in Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The path to our dreams lies before us, beyond these endless plains, in far-off, distant lands. Hahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Will the Holy Order just sit idly by, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We'll just have to show them that we won't be broken by the likes of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(The path to our dreams, huh? My dream lies beyond the shadows...but I shall stake it all on you.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Zahar became a sworn knight of Wratharis, and not soon after, he distinguished himself at the Battle of Gilrack.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(He never even used any alchemy, for disdain of intervention by the Holy Guard.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Gaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hm. Utter weaklings!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Who the hell is that silver-haired knight?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>He's slaughtering all of us! Keep an eye out! He's not like any of the other Wratharis soldiers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(His skill with a blade and strategical prowess have improved yet again. Just how high will you rise, Zahar?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>In my absence, you've grown ever stronger... Hahaha... A silver steed... No... a silver lion fights amongst us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(Letitia, you're really a complete mystery. Can you even fight?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yaaaaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You're in the way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What was...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(That was blindingly fast! So this is the woman that has earned Zahar's respect, huh?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hahaha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(I can't let myself lag behind!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Taste my blade of gloom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(Wratharis claimed a decisive victory over Envylia in the skirmish.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(We charged into battle after battle, leading Wratharis' forces to consecutive victories.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(Before long...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Zahar's returned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Zahar, the Hero of Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(The people of Wratharis began revering him as a hero.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Sir Zahar, our alchemical research has started making leaps and bounds in progress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The knowledge you've given us from your time in the Holy Order has been indispensable to our research. We expect more results in the near future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I am glad to be of service. What was it that you wanted to show me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Look! These figures show the quantity of alchemy present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>We produced them artificially—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You've been conducting all of this research in secret? For what purpose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The Magna Code and the Alchemist Code are shackles borne from an imperfect entity. They will be obsolete in Zahar's new world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I heard you were a Paladin in the Holy Guard at the same time as Zahar. When did you come to Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Bah. Not going to answer me, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Corvus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It's unusual for you to approach me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What is the significance of that eyepatch?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>To...control my power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Power...? What kind of power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I possess a cursed eye passed down through the Leonhart family and inherited by a single member in each generation. The Evil Eye, as it's known, grants me great power...but causes me excruciating pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I would be consumed by the shadows if it were ever unleashed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Really now...? What a splendid sight that would be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Bah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>(She really is one to be wary of.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yes. We've received word that they are planning to raid a Wratharis highborn's estate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>The home of the Research Director in fact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I wonder...if we have a mole in our midst.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>No, it may have been the work of the Corpse. Those filth specialize in reconnaissance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>It seems we've drawn the attention of some old friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What do you think we should do? They are still our enemy. Should we deal with them, or have you something in mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Wratharis won't be able to fend them off unless we sortie. Although...I may have an amusing idea. What if we were to outwit the scheming wretches?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Outwit them? In what way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>We could, for example, arm ourselves in some very nostalgic raiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You're saying...we should disguise ourselves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>(I never thought I'd be in this getup again.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Zahar, they're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hm... You got here quicker than expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You're late. The house is already cleaned out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>What? How?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hey! What're you wretches doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You traitorous snakes!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Say you, the snakes who turn their venom upon the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Death to the traitors!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Now that we've gotten rid of the trash, let's get back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Zahar, I sense someone inside the house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>It must be the Corpse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>This is what they've been planning all along! They're going to burn down the whole place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Still rotten to the core, I see! Stop them at once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Please! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Spill his guts to the floor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>N-no—Aaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Kill every last one of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>You dogs of the Holy Order...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Zahar, you wretch... You've made our job here quite the pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I cannot let this sin go unpunished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Perfect. You'll die here with the rest of the them then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>The incessant babbling of a dead man means nothing to me.</td>
</tr>
