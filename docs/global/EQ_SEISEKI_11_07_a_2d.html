<td>Grk...!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Nngh... S-she got me...from behind?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Y-you... How did you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I heard it this time! Excalibur told me exactly where to go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It resonated with your location, showing me exactly how to find you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's right... Cadanova, I had heard that you once trained with the Lord Commander Zain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That would explain what gave you the chance to learn about Yogi Ku's weapon forging...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Indeed, Yogi Ku is an old friend of mine. There's no way I could mistake his work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's shameful that it took me so long to realize...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>However, I cannot understand how you could have gotten your hands on Yogi Ku's work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Urgh... A-and why would...I tell you...something like...that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>There's no reason for me to bother telling anything to a bunch of people nearing their deathbeds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Impossible! He still has that much strength left?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>D-don't worry! I definitely won't lose to someone like him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ha! This is the Lord Commander of the Holy Guard? The difference in our power makes me laugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You might be right... If strength was the only thing I had on my side, I would have no hope of winning this fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If strength...was the only thing you had...on your side?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You may be stronger than me, but I have something that will ensure that I never lose to the likes of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ha, and what would that be, little girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That thing that you gave up on long ago... The determination to do what my heart tells me is right, to use my sword for peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I haven't given up on that dream yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This sword of mine... Its duty is to save the world from unhappiness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I will never give up on that, no matter how difficult it gets!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This is the vow I made, one that I swore to never turn my back on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ha...hahahaha! I never thought I'd see the day when I would find myself in agreement with something this girl said!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Grk... You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No matter how much stronger you are than me, I will never lose to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I could never lose to someone who has given up on their own heart and values!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Silence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huzzzaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No, Kanon! It is careless to just rush in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Her attack was deflected?! Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You managed to land one blow upon me due to the element of surprise...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>However, as I pointed out before, my strength has lent me the ability to win every battle I have undertaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That said...it has been quite a long time since I last acquired a real injury on the battlefield. I must now ensure that it will not happen again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ack...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>How much of his remaining strength was he hiding?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Kanon! Please, run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Run? Haha... To where? I shall reduce this entire space to rubble! No one will be left alive once I am done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This... This is no bluff!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No... It's come to this... I must...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hmph. I don't know what you plan to do, but it is too late. I have already finished all the necessary preparations!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No! It can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Die, Paladin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Grgnhhhhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>G-grahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Zahar?! This power is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You have fully unleashed your powers of darkness?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>H-hahaha... Did I beat you to the punch? Zehn! This is the end for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What are you doing?! Do you plan to destroy even yourself?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Don't make me laugh... I will bury my enemies here, and I will be the last one standing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ha! I'll believe you when I see it! Die, Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Lord Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Gnngghhhhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You do not disappoint me, Zehn... I never expected you would be able to gain access to this much power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>However... It is still limited by your human body! One which cannot even conceive of the power that the world of darkness has to offer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Y-you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Bow before a powerful darkness that no human can ever know! Unlimited Zero!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Agh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>H-he's...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>U-urgh! Wh-what is this strength?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>If I hadn't returned to this world, perhaps things would have worked out better for you... Unfortunately, it was not to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Welcome the fate I have been brought here to deliver upon you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Gah... Argh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...Nngh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Z-Zahar...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Nn...Nngh... G-gnghhhhh! Grh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>This is not good! The darkness is beginning to overwhelm him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The darkness?! Lord Zahar! You mustn't allow it to get the better of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Ha. Haha...hahahaha! It's too bad, Zahar! It looks like fate is on my side today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>He disappeared?! Watch out, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I spent too much time playing around with you all... It's time to really put an end to this little chat of ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Do not think we will simply allow such a thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Allow? Ha! It's time for you to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Ah... You cannot hear the voice of that sword at all, it seems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You... Behind me again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Did I tell you? I can hear the voice of that sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>What... What is that sound...? The blade is...shuddering?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Swords are more than just weapons. They carry within them the legacy our hearts most want to leave behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Not just the heart of the wielder, but also of the maker... I can hear the sadness contained in that blade. It remembers the heart of my father and suffers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Miss...Miuna...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You're... Yogi Ku's...</td>
</tr>
