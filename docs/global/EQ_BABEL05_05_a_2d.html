<td>005</td>
<td>Hey, Albea. This is a pleasant surprise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Where did he get to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You came all the way to Wratharis in search of your brother? That's a hell of a trip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is a big country. Want me to help you find him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I heard that there's a very energetic, blond-haired man with a distinct laugh here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Apparently, he's been seen hanging around with a man with pink hair...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>A genius gambler who never loses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>My brother, Magnus. I heard he's here.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Let me through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Not a chance.</td>

<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Why did you keep quiet about him?!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You know my brother, don't you?! Why didn't you tell me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>To tell you the truth, it's not actually the gambling I'm into.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't change the subject!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>He's always winning big and losing just as much in these games.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I won't let you mess up his hand.</td>

<td>What are you going on about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Is it so wrong for me to want to see my brother?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Am I not even allowed to let him know that a relative of ours passed away?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Are you saying that we need to live our whole lives apart...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Without even knowing where the other is or what they are doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I...!</td>

<td>What I'm saying...is that I don't want anyone to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Who's going to...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>People pray before making a bet, don't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Even though they know it won't change a thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This is my prayer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's better for at least one of you to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Better that, than both of you being gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You won't...change your mind, will you? No matter what I say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There are just some things that can't be said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Tch! Show-off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yeah, we guys are always trying to show off.</td>

<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What is it with you?! One second you're protecting me, and the next you're standing in my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I told you from the start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'm a troublemaker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm an ally to none...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>But that doesn't make me the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I just go around causing trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Sir, please refrain from causing quarrels within the—</td>

<td>Getting blacklisted by this place... You think that means anything to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>If that's how you want to do this...</td>
