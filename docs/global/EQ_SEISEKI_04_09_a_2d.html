<td>You think that everyone will panic if you tell them, right?</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We're gonna go take out a rock that can take out the world. Or something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Or something like that? Don't be so casual about it. Some of the other Paladins might hear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Who cares. They'll find out soon enough anyway. After all, who wants to die without knowing anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Well, that's true...</td>

<td>Anyway, since this is the situation, it's quite a hassle that we have to hurry there.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Why are you so calm?! Please hurry up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's something important that could sway the fate of this plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Afterall...I'm acting on direct orders from Captain Zain. It's a super-duper invention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>A super-duper invention?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Seriously! Don't interrupt me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
