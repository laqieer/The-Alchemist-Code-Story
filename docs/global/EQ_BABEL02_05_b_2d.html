<td>But sir, you're covered in blood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>A necessary sacrifice to defeat someone of his caliber!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Zahar, give it up! You've lost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Captain! We should withdraw! The soldiers are already losing morale!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Corvus, out of my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Captain Zahar, we can't let our ambitions die here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Zahar! Fall back! Have you forgotten our dream?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>His Majesty decrees that the defeat at Gilrack lies on the fault of three individuals: Zahar, Captain of the Knights of Wratharis; Vice-Captain Corvus; and Military Advisor Letitia!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(I learned afterward that the Holy Guard had pressured Wratharis into making the decision.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(As a newly appointed knight, I wasn't able to follow after him.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(Without Zahar, the Knights of Wratharis held no meaning to me anymore.)</td>

<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Zahar...</td>

<td>We could live in the these woods, along with all the woodland critters.</td>

<td>We could, I suppose.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>An even more perilous gale than the winds of this barren waste await us on our path to darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We never had any lasting bond to Wratharis anyway. What better way to cut ties, don't you think, Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Agreed. They have long since outlived their use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hahaha, deeper into the cursed darkness it is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Letitia, is everything ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes, Lord Zahar. Everyone is eager to see your dream become a reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It is time for you to be crowned King of Darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Let us pursue the fruition of your dream...my lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Heh heh heh, we shall rid the world of the false light that envelops it and the debauchery it calls justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
