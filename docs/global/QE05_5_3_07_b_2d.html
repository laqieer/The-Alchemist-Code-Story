<td>Way ahead of you!</td>

<td>We don't need you to order us around!</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Finally, we have arrived. How strange to have been called so far, a field apart from my comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yet it seems that I have made it in time for the climax of this tale, at the very least.</td>

<td>It is the end of you; already forsaken of your humanity! The cradle of which you spoke is now no more than a hollow filled with your selfishness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If you truly wish for peace, now is your chance to quietly pass away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No... Nooooooooooooo!</td>
