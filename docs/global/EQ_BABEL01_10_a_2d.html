<td>Natalie, does the medic unit need to resupply? Natalie...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I know how you feel...but this is no time to let ourselves lose sight of things. Your unit needs you to lead them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You're one to talk. Time has passed since...but you haven't bounced back yet either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What are you talking about? I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The knights are worried about you, you know. They've been saying that there are shadows gathering within Sunbright Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmm. I thought I'd been doing a good job of hiding that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I just haven't come to terms yet with all the things we lost when the Lion Monarch Orion descended on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Uh... Ahem. I'm sorry to interrupt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You don't need to be so polite, Nina. What is it? Did Victor do something again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Um... No! It's really not his fault, he's just quite, um...loud? He didn't mean to startle me. It really was my own fault for... Ahem. I apologize. I seem to have gotten off track.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I needed to speak with you in regards to another matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Another matter? What do you mean, Nina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm so sorry. I know it's not my place, but...I just thought that maybe...it might be good for the two of you to, um... Maybe perk up a little?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I know that Sir Gerald wouldn't be happy to see the two of you this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Gerald...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Um, well... It just feels like we're letting him down by not being able to move on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I remember he said something like...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>"We swore that our iron wills should stand indomitable in the face of hardship in order to ensure the joy and laughter of the people!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Something terrible happened. We lost someone important to us due to senseless violence. That's our  reality. However...if we lose sight of our promises and what we were fighting for in the first place...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...Honestly, I think he would sneer at us. He fought until the bitter end for the principles he held dear and the vow he once made with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Sir Gerald entrusted me with carrying on all that he held in his heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Like his hope to support Captain Vettel in continuing his role as the heart of the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Like his devotion to the Scarlet Flame Guard, always putting it first, before even himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I truly hope to become like him; someone who fully embodies all the ideals of the Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But I can't do it alone. I need you to look to the future and do this with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...Heh. Nina's got that spark, just like Gerald always did. Don't you think, Natalie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh no... I'm sorry! I'm sorry for letting my mouth run away with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You! You are so like Gerald. It makes me sick! I can practically hear that idiot laughing at us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Heh... By the way, Nina, does that mean you're aiming for the same position he held? Are we looking at the future Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>U-um... I-if that...was what Sir Gerald would have wanted... I will do my best! I will definitely do my best to become a suitable Vice-Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>In that case, I will do my part by healing your wounds! Just...like I used to do for Gerald.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Indeed... It's time to start looking to the future. That is the path he left behind for us. Right, Vettel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Indeed. Thank you, Nina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Come on, it's time to shake this all off. We need to pump morale back up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Morale, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>About that... Actually, I kind of have an idea. You know the dress uniform for knights...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>This is...where the Scarlet Flame Guard began!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes. This is where Gerald, Natalie, and I made the vow that started all of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh. Interesting place to decide to have some swordfights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It was Nina's idea! It seemed a fitting way to honor Gerald, who spent his life in battle until the very end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>She thought that it would be nice to come here to show him that our iron will has not faded, that we are still fighting the good fight wherever we can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Gerald saw battle, even practice matches, as a place that opens up the potential to grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Even if it was a training match, Ironheart Gerald would come at you with his full strength, no mercy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>And after a thousand swings, too. That guy was certainly consistent in his bull-headedness... Well. Are we going to do this or what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Aw, yeah! I'm pumped up about this! This is gonna be fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Eep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Victor! Quit freaking Nina out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ahem. Now then, shall we begin this...unconventional memorial service for my old friend, Gerald? A training mission of sorts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Are you watching, Gerald? I hope you're happy! We're doing this for you, you know! Scarlet Flame Guard, at the ready!</td>
