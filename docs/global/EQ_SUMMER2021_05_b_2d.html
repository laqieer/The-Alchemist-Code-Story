<td>No! No! Great One lend us your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(This isn't good. The whole cave might collapse if too epic of a battle is allowed to go on.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(If something isn't done quick... But if we do too much, then the impact on the cave will be too great.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(Everyone's on the defensive, but if this drags on... Worst case scenario we have a cave in.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(I have to think of a way out of this...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ah hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I just remembered how to summon the Great One!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What?! Y-You have to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Tell you? If you wanted to know, you should've tried asking nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't do this... You don't have to take them on alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...Good work, Shenmei. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Su Yi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Y-Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I have a request to make... Can you fire over there for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huh? Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes. Now that Shenmei has distracted so many of them, you should have a clear shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>B-But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It'll be okay. With your skill, I know you can hit the target. I believe in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Okay! I understand. I know what to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Target in sight... Fire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>hah! Where are you aiming?! There's no one there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wh-What the...?! The ground is giving way... Ahhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>W-Water? Wh-What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I see... They blew a hole through the weak rock formation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's right. I thought this would be an effective means of seizing control of the situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It seems your magical device has had it. Time to give up. It's painful not knowing when to quit, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>D-Dammit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I don't think we should linger long! The cave is starting to collapse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You're right... We need to get out of here fast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Everyone, wait a moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You all need to come with us. We can get out of here together... Take my hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Shenmei...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wh-Why? Why would you extend a hand to me? You wouldn't simply let us go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Of course, I won't forgive you for abusing my pirate's sense of romance and adventure! But that's a separate matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The captain of the Xiao Shenmei leaves no one behind. We don't forsake others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I-I'll help you, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Okay! Pull on three! One... Two... Three!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Geez... Always making me out to be a big softy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Heh... You sound very proud when you say that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...Well, yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Pfew! Well, we've handed the heretics over to security, so I think we're all done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Seems so. And with the truth of the treasure rumors revealed, the other pirates are dispersing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Maybe the shores here will be peaceful once again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>And it's all thanks to your quick thinking! They never expected us to blow a hole in the cave, but it let us turn the tables.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Please, I did nothing special. Su Yi is the one who managed to actually make the hole in the right place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>And the reason I was able to proceed with such a plan was because you and Liu Shen were there to help me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It's like you said... It's not a bad idea to depend on others once in a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Not at all! Let me carry the load to help you out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We're family aren't we? There's nothing strange about me wanting to help you carry things sometimes, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(That boy was always trying to help me... He was always more than happy to.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(When I next see him, I'll have to learn to depend on him a little more.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hmm? Nefertiti, what're you thinking about? You're smiling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hehe... I was thinking of something I'm looking forward to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I know what you mean! I always get excited thinking about the next adventure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Sure that treasure map was fake, but the next adventure will be even greater! I wonder what awaits us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Shenmei! Look at this! I found a new treasure map!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>A treasure map? Where?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>While relaxing on the sandy beach, a bottle with a map inside was found. Whether it's real is anyone's guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Woohoo! On to new adventure! Raise the gangplank! Rig up the sails!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Oh, Xiao-Xiao... You'll never learn will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Of course not! A pirate lives for the romance of hunting for treasure! Let's set sail, Su Yi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'm with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Hey, wait for me! Don't just set off willy-nilly! Can we at least take a short breather?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hehe... It looks like the fun is just beginning, and a wonderful summer is on its way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>This summer is to be treasured!</td>
