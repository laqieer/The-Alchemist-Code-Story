<td>It's up!</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This one's all yours, Godslayer.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Miss, and you'll WISH you were dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You'd like to see that, wouldn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'll show you why they call me Godslayer!</td>

<td>Eliza's cannons obliterate the incoming volleyball before it ever touches her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...What the?!</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's not part of the...</td>

<td>Good work, Lucan, Alymere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I concede defeat. All units, withdraw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...My Queen? Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That wasn't a direct blow to the head, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Would I still be sitting here if it was? Ugh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Obvious answers aside...you've done well. Both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Now, I have things to get back to. You may spend the rest of your little "break" here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But cause any further destruction and I'll revoke your access permanently. Am I understood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I...uhh... What was that all about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Did she just tell us to enjoy ourselves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It would seem so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm more surprised this turned out well at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>And just who was responsible for goading her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You say that as if you weren't the one who drew her face on in the first place!</td>

<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It'll be too soon before I rid you from my sight.</td>

<td>You wish, sister. We're not done yet.</td>

<td>- Goetia, Lost Blue Sub Base -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hmm... All right. That will be all for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I will send for Nesha later when the financial report is ready.</td>

<td>Understood, my Queen.</td>

<td>Eliza flips through the report and data assembled from the day's observations.</td>

<td>So it is true. The living weapons seem to be changing their hosts on a biological level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>In fact, it might even be symbiotic at this point...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>My purpose is servitude, my lady.</td>

<td>Test subject "Red VI" has yet to be assimilated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Statistically, where all previous hosts have succumbed to Berith's...appetite, test subject "Red VI" alone remains operational.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hm. In that case, this "Red VI" should make for an interesting control case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I suppose we should proceed with the redesignation sooner rather than later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Now that the day's unpleasantness is over...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Eliza drums her fingers on the armrest, smiling at the thought of her stuffed toys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Perhaps it is time for a tea party!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's summer, so...maybe some refreshing iced tea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
