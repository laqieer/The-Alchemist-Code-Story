<td>Ack! It's as resilient as ever. I don't think I can hit it!</td>

<td>It seems to still remember our way of fighting. It's predicting my sword blows as well.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>In a small place like this, we can't make any unpredictable movements. What should we do? The way it is now, it's just like you said before.</td>

<td>You told me that it's easy to dodge a straight-on attack. I guess that's especially true when it comes to machines.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hahah. You idiots! This advanced technology has evolved this city! This is the power of our civilization!</td>

<td>The time of the old mafia is over! I'll use the Messiah to rule all of Slothstein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You're trying to use humans to restore something that could be done with machines. Just watch what I do to your stupidâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Heh. You seem to be misunderstanding something. You're not using the Messiah. The Messiah is using you.</td>

<td>You're a leech. All you did was trade me for this piece of junk. Not once have you stood on your own two feet.</td>

<td>It doesn't seem to learn, does it? It consumed enough energy to make its belly explode, but it still keeps eating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Aghh...ahh...I can't control...my legs... What's happening? What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? You were just being used by that piece of scrap.</td>

<td>This is what you get for refusing to grow up. No matter how many times a leech conveniently changes its host, it'll never learn to walk on its own.</td>

<td>Hey look, Edgar. These flat lines intersect vertically and horizontally...creating a three-dimensional effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Of course, if lines intersect like that they...hold on...three-dimensional!</td>
