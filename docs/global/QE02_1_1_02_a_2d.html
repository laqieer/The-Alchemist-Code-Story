<td>Our non-stop ride must've given you a chill. Drink this. It'll warm you a little.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What's the matter? Cold soup won't do much to warm your spirits. Better drink up while it's hot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What do you plan to do with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>From what I heard of your conversation at the cathedral, it didn't sound like you were any friend of Ethan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Jeez, girl. We escaped that mess together. Can't you trust me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hukk! Nooo! Don't be fooled, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh? A-Allie?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, I'll be... This thing can talk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>N-no! It shouldn't have that feature! Allie, are you really speaking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Of course I am, aye! I'm gonna protect you, Fiona!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Don't let this strange hooligan sweet talk you into anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hooligan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>How is this even possible?! It's a miracle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>My father was right! He used to say, 'Treasure something and you'll give it life.'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>True. You've been hugging that thing from since you were little. It might as well sprout a soul or two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Since I was little? How do you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Never mind. Anyway, drink up and warm yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If you're worried, go ahead and run an ingredient analysis on it. Can't guarantee the taste though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Analyzing... Analyzing... Analysis complete, aye! No poison or harmful ingredients detected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's a cheap soup for commoners with little nutrition, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...You didn't have to mention the price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Pretty good, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Them again. What a persistent bunch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Alkaroids. They're androids mass produced by the Beckrams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's the AJ20 Model, an earlier production type, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>One energy recharge will allow it to run for three days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Three days? Jeez, I guess that rules out waiting around for them to run out of power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Sorry, bud. I'm gonna have to terminate your friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>They're no friends of mine, aye! Don't lump us together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Alkemonos are pet robots developed by us, the Elesters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Unlike the Alkaroids that were mass-produced for manual labor and security, they won't harm people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>A pet? Why would you need something like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>My father invented them after seeing the country grow more brutal under the advances of mechanization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>He wanted to create something that would give peace to people,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The Alkemono was developed to make people aware of the importance of empathy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Unlike the Alkaroids that were manufactured primarily for profit, the development philosophy itself is completely different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I see. Sounds like something Mayor Edward would come up with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I doubt this new droid-wielding mayor would've sat well with your old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh? You knew my father?</td>
