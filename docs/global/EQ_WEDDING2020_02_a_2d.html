<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>The mine where we can get Felicitite is around here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Sure is. The entrance is further in town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Thanks to the mine, this area has flourished. Weaponsmiths, jewelers and miners all came here to work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And since Felicitite is said to have purifying properties, many traveled from afar to purchase it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You don't say! You know your stuff, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A while back, I was stationed nearby for military training, so I could visit this town every now and then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If memory serves me well, there should be a top-notch restaurant around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ah! It's still here! Sure brings back memories. I often came here with my comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ewan, my man! Heard you spoke up to that bulldog of a drill sergeant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Aw, come on. Let's not ruin our meal talking about that. It was nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I just warned him that our training might provoke a monster attack and cause damage to the locals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>How is that insubordination? Besides, I'm a first-rate soldier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Our superiors have their eyes on you, lately. You've been hanging out with bums like me who aren't devoted enough to our country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I don't care what they think. I wish I had half as much passion as you do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Passion I have. It was passion for everyday citizens that made me become a soldier--not patriotism.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ever the idealist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Don't worry. I’ll try not to influence you. I'm sure your father would be none too happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But actually…that's why I--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hey now. Don't give me that face. You're not thinking of quitting the service, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I don’t think you've ever tried to change me. Let's just keep doing our best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Besides, I'm me. I decide who I spend my time with and how I live my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I too was young once. I used to talk about a lot of things. Seems so long ago…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Such lovely memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>…Yeah. They're very precious to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But this town isn't as lively as you described, Lord Ewan. There are hardly any people, and…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…those we encounter all carry weapons. The atmosphere is quite threatening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Watchmen… So, the rumors were true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What rumors?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That hordes of monsters suddenly started appearing around here--monsters that don't usually inhabit the area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Towns and villages must have hired sentries like those fellows we saw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It's a matter of survival. But the problem won't be resolved until we address the underlying cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hmm... Maybe there was a territorial dispute among monsters, and they were driven out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's plausible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The fact that this rumor checks out must also mean the mine is closed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Say what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I heard some of the monsters found their way into the mine, so it was closed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>*Gasp* How will we get the Felicitite I need to make the wedding knife?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Good question… But what's done is done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Besides, the mine has always been a dangerous place. Accidents weren't uncommon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I remember suggesting they find a safer site to dig, but nobody would listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The craftsmen insisted on working with Felicitite, so the miners needed to meet that demand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>All this time, the miners have been working under dangerous conditions despite the risks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Maybe it's a blessing in disguise. At least if the mine is closed there won’t be any more accidental deaths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Aw, bummer. This really stinks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I hate it when I can't make what I want--even if there's a good reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>With the mine closed, it will be difficult acquiring Felicitite. Will you give up, Lucia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Never! I have a "No compromises" policy when it comes to weapon-making.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>If mining has stopped, I'll go there myself and get what I need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I swear I'll make a wedding knife out of Felicitite! Mark my words!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Good grief… I thought you'd say something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hmph. She still feels forced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You were hoping we could avoid a dangerous situation, weren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I was. But I know how Lucia gets. She just barrels on ahead, doesn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>How else are we supposed to get the Felicitite I need for my wedding knife?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>See? And besides, I'm curious to see the mine myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm glad they shut it down, but I don't like that the monsters are threatening the peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Wouldn’t it be great if we could lend a hand? A soldier's duty is to maintain peace, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>A soldier's duty, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Be warned. All sorts of creepy-crawlies live in the mines--things without feet...that slither on the ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Yuck...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Just think if something like that were to fall from the ceiling and slide down your leg…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>…Huh? Mei Fang, what's that by your foot?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Eeeeeeeeeeeyaaaaaaaaaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Lady Mei Fang!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Gotcha! Ha-ha. You should've seen the look on your face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You dolt! How dare you trick me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hey, this time I was joking, but the danger is real.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Back in the day, accidents happened so frequently I was called in for more than a few rescues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>How dreadful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Come to think of it, I was stuck following a headstrong type back then, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>(All he ever thought about was protecting the people.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>(He said he'd die happily as long as he lived up to his motto--"A soldier's duty is to protect others.")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>But he died far removed from those he wanted to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>He and a small battalion were sent to fight a bloody war partly as a warning to others…and to crush his spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I knew exactly who that warning was meant for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Someone like me, born to a military family, mustn't associate with unpatriotic screw-ups.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I was too naïve or oblivious to comprehend something so simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>In some way, that fool's desire to protect the weak from senseless violence got him killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>"Do your best." That was the motto I shared with my men and comrades. It meant no sacrifices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>…In the end, they all died for their country...and I'm to blame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>So many hopes and dreams cut short because of me…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>(Forced from birth to follow the path of a soldier--and all I've ever done is take.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>You're looking glum. What's on your mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Me? Don't worry. Just because I'm staring doesn't mean something's going to pop out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Inscrutable as ever…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Me? Inscrutable? Don't be silly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>We're probably thinking the same thing--like how to bypass the mine closure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>If you say so. The fact remains--any method we choose to enter is sure to be dodgy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>They should've kept the mine open, in my opinion. But we’ll need to ascertain the situation in order to proceed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>So, you're against the closure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Felicitite can only be found here. The purer the ore the higher the concentration of alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>The superstitions related to the ore and the alchemy contained therein have created a huge demand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You're probably right to say the mine is dangerous, but for the miners--it's their livelihood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>…You've got a good point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Besides, something about this bothers me--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>You mean the sudden increase in monsters? It's quite strange, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Oh dear! What's this? Rattys have blocked our path. Would you mind stepping aside, little Rattys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Squeak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Oh, what nice claws you have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Squeak?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>So sharp and shiny! And strong too, I’m sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Let me get a closer look! Come here, you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>S-Squeak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>No, Lady Lucia! Please get back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>S-Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!</td>
</tr>
