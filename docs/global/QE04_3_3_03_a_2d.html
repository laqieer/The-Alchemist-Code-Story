<td>You seem to have placed quite a bit of trust in those two. Don't you wonder what will happen if they fail to return?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I am certain they will return. I have placed my trust in them. All that remains is for me to believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>How can you be like that? The only thing I believe in is results. Is it not foolish to believe in results that are yet to be determined?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No, it is not foolish. If you truly wish to change Saga, how about you try and place some trust in others for a change?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Nonsense. Like I just told you: the last time I believed in someone...I lost Alia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...Ah, right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>However, if all goes well, the Wind Matter will be restored and Saga will return to the way it is meant to be. That is a gratifying thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Saga's culture continues to be passed down from generation to generation since ancient times so that we do not forget the threat of nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If we rely on nature the way that we do now, we may very well incur its wrath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...Eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The wrath of nature... True, it exists within our ancient lore. "Those who walk not with nature shall endure judgment under the ancient dragon."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Right... The vision that Tina foresaw was referring to the dragon from ancient lore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What vision? ...Ah, I recall her mentioning such things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Tina has received the power of foresight from Asena. Thus, apparently, she glimpsed the future of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>A future where a giant dragon appeared and trampled over the land of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hmph. Foresight is nonsense. The future is always an uncertain thing. I will do whatever I can to bring about my ideal future...that's all I can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What's so funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I was recalling how Tina said something similar. You two have more in common than you realize, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What nonsense. Isn't it time you returned to your Water Temple? It must be tasking for your old body to carry Matter within your body for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hmph. Don't underestimate my strength, Tehre boy. That being said, I enjoyed our conversation. I look forward to seeing you at the Sprite Trio Discourse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I still haven't decided to attend yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...No, I am certain you will attend. Would you like to bet on it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If we are to hold the discourse, it should be held at the Wind Temple. It will suitable for the theme of this particular occasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>So much for your reluctance... Well then, excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We still cannot be sure it will be held...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The Wind Shamans have yet to overcome the final barrier of the trial!</td>
</tr>
