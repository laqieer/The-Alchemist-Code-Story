</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>
<td>Yes, actually. This knife is a weapon gifted to me by a goddess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/kevi.png" alt="Kevin" height="128"><br>Kevin</td>
<td>A knife bestowed by a goddess, huh? That's sure nothing to sneeze at!</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>
<td>Oh, sorry. The person who summoned me here said she called for additional help from my world, and it dawned on me that she might mean my goddess, which would be worrisome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ira.png" alt="Ila" height="128"><br>Ila</td>

<td>Well, she can't...exactly fight, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/kevi.png" alt="Kevin" height="128"><br>Kevin</td>
<td>That's a strange way to put it. If she can't fight, though, then she probably wouldn't be summoned here to help, would she?</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>
<td>I certainly hope not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hmm. Well, if this goddess of yours isn't the one joining our ranks, do you have any other ideas who it might be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dung_bell.png" alt="Bell Cranel" height="128"><br>Bell Cranel</td>
<td>It could be any of a number of my comrades from the Familia: Lili, Haruhime, maybe Welf or Mikoto...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/kevi.png" alt="Kevin" height="128"><br>Kevin</td>
<td>Oho! A lot of those sound like girls' names. Seems I've got something to look forward to!</td>

<td>Regardless of who it is, they're not safe here alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/kevi.png" alt="Kevin" height="128"><br>Kevin</td>
<td>That's true. We can't just stand idly by when a girl is potentially in danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/kevi.png" alt="Kevin" height="128"><br>Kevin</td>
<td>Not to mention the fact that gaining yet another friend will bolster our strength in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
