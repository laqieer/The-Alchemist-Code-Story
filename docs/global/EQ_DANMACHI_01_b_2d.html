<td>001</td>
<td>You sure held your own out there! The name's Kevin; pleased to meet you. And this here is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm Ila. And you...are stronger than I gave you credit for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>My name is Bell Cranel. Nice to meet you both as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Likewise. We're your companions on this quest. And as long as we're around, you should think of us as friends, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>"Friends"? Speak for yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Umm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't worry about her. Come time for battle, she'll have your back either way. Our homeland is in peril, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I couldn't care less what happens to Wratharis, frankly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Though I suppose...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You...suppose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I suppose there are some things here worth protecting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'd hate it if any children had to suffer because of this fight, for example.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And there you have it! Calling it now: Us friends are gonna get along great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmph! I can't stand it when you talk like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Acting all buddy-buddy as soon as we meet anyone at all, instantly calling them "friends"...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>My only friends are the ones I made long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oof! Well, sor-ry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That being said, let's try to start off on the right foot, shall we? Thanks for your help, Bell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And thank you for yours. I'm sure we'll get along great...is what I'd like to say, but I admit, I have a few concerns about that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't worry. I'm sure we'll naturally grow closer as we work together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So, that knife of yours... It's kind of intriguing. Does it have some kind of special power or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes, actually. This knife is a weapon gifted to me by a goddess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>A knife bestowed by a goddess, huh? That's sure nothing to sneeze at!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes, it's very—wait! My goddess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh? What's gotten into you all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh, sorry. The person who summoned me here said she called for additional help from my world, and it dawned on me that she might mean my goddess, which would be worrisome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If she were summoned here to help, then she'd have to be pretty strong herself. What's the problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, she can't...exactly fight, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's a strange way to put it. If she can't fight, though, then she probably wouldn't be summoned here to help, would she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I certainly hope not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hmm. Well, if this goddess of yours isn't the one joining our ranks, do you have any other ideas who it might be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It could be any of a number of my comrades from the Familia: Lili, Haruhime, maybe Welf or Mikoto...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oho! A lot of those sound like girls' names. Seems I've got something to look forward to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>And just what might that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Regardless of who it is, they're not safe here alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's true. We can't just stand idly by when a girl is potentially in danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Not to mention the fact that gaining yet another friend will bolster our strength in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I am not a friend to either of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Traveling companion, then. Better?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Not the best start to this adventure, is it?</td>
</tr>
