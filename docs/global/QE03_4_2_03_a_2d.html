<td>Gyaaahhhhhh!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wh...what the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Haven't you forgotten about your Broom Ace? You better ride on it properly. If you fall from this height, you won't survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How dare you take pity on us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What's wrong with that? I don't want Liz to see any more people die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What are you talking about?! Aren't you a descendant of Helkovara who kicked down countless witches and paved her way to glory?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That brand of the Helkovara family ends with my mother's generation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>In the past, the witches of this country could never love people properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This isn't just limited to the opposite sex. I'm talking about between witches as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Everyone was either a romantic or professional rival. That's why witches never held hands with other witches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But I was saved by Liz's hand. Holding Liz's hand is what brought me this far!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And I promise that we will achieve what no one else ever hasâ€”the removal of Asmodeus' curse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We will show you the power of holding each other's hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>W-what nonsense! The queen has forbidden any to lay hands on Asmodeus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>In that case, I will act as queen and change everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Queen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I was disciplined strictly from an early age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No matter who kicks you down, head for the top. That's the Helkovara family motto I was taught.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yet, in spite of all the talk about aiming for the top, not one witch of Helkovara ever became queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>They resigned themselves to just being the elite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That was the limit of the Helkovara family who always fought alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>At Sabbath, I was defeated by both Liz and Alma who worked together. At that point, I felt my limit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The limit of a single witch. I will surpass that and, beyond the clouds, I will obtain Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This feat will destroy all sense of value that has existed until now and usher in a new era for us witches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I want to create a Lustburg where witches can take each other's hands and stand together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Do you dare to say that you'll take the place of the queen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If things will not change, then it is time for a revolution!</td>
