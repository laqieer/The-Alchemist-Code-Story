<td>002</td>
<td>Oh! You Wadatsumi swordsmen really are a force to be reckoned... Ah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>D-did I say something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I never thought I would ever be acknowledged by a valiant general such as yourself. It pleases me greatly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>O-oh! I see, I see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...It really made me happy when you first said it. It's just I couldn't put it into words very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Awww, it's already over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>How's it going on your end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We've come to an agreement. The higher-ups in Lustburg were having a difficult time dealing with these bandits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They will turn a blind eye to the commotion that we caused because we were able to expose these guys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>All that's left is for us to hand these guys to the guards and get the cacao to where it needs to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And with that, we're gonna head back first. We'll get the chocolate prep started, so hurry back, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Making chocolates... Okay... I'm ready for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hm? Leafah? Why so serious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Leafah still has something super important to do, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yeah...I do. But it'll be okay. I won't run away from this. I'll face this head on and put everything I feel into my chocolates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm not very good at this kind of thing, but I'll manage somehow! I think I'll be able to express myself through Valentine's Day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Speaking of which, Leafah, you gave Yomi some chocolates, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yeah... I made some chocolates for Yomi, and...some apology chocolates for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>For me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ooo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What do you have to apologize for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Waaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>N-n-n-never mind! J-j-just know I'm sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You love Valentine's Day, yet I went and said some things that maybe made it less enjoyable for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>S-so I w-wanted to apologize for that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You're really...honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I see... Hah...hahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Eh! Why are you laughing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Why wouldn't we laugh? You ended up saying everything out loud after all! What happened to the plan we came up with?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It didn't feel like enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(I had no idea how to interact with the person who was once General of Greed Dike.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I see. Just be straightforward and honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Suzuka?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No, it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I was just thinking about the kind of chocolate I want to make for Leafah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Happy Valentine's Day with lots of love!</td>
