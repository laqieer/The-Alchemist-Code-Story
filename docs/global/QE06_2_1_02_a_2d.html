<td>What do you mean?</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's the only logical answer. At first, I thought she came up with the technique by herself, but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>How could anybody learn something so powerful so quickly? Besides…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I remember Amane saying something about hearing voices, and seeing visions that were not her own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What the hell…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So that's why the demons were after her…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…I can't say for sure. Not yet anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Dammit, Tanosuke! We don't have time for speculation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Why else would the demons target Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…After all, I have the same power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Stop! STOP IT!!!!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So that's why the Discarnate Power didn't go after you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's right…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Unlike Amane, I cannot access that "power."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So that's what's going on…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Amane may act recklessly--even thoughtlessly, sometimes--but she's also innocent and naive…a normal, kindhearted girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If anything sets her apart…it must be her ability to access that power. Don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>…Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then what about the "voices" and "visions" you were talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>…The thing is...I don't know what they are. Amane doesn't seem to know either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>…I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ugachi!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If, somehow, they wind up threatening our safety, you'll have to be purged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…and Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If necessary, her as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…You know, sometimes--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I don't know who or what I am. I can't tell if I'm in control of my own actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Amane said something like that before. But right now, the person standing here is me--Blade Fox Corps Third Squad Captain Tanosuke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>…What are you trying to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I don't know what's inside me…but whatever it is, it's a part of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Spare us your monologue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If I become a danger to the Blade Fox Corps or the local people, then I'd happily be purged. But for now…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I want you to trust me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>…! Celis, you…!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Cool your head. I understand how you feel, but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We can't afford to lose any more members--or lives… I'm sure you agree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>…Tch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Just remember I won't hold back if you turn on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Of course--I wouldn't have it any other way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>…You're a sly fox.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'm not trying to be sly. Honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>In any case, there are no simple answers. This mysterious power and these voices and visions…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>If we can somehow connect the dots, we might start to see the bigger picture…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I hate to interrupt, but our scouts have reported a horde of demons approaching the castle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Could it be the Discarnate Powers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>No, there was no mention of purebloods included in the report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Damn demons…what are they planning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Who knows…but our duty remains the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That's right… We can't allow them to cause any more damage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I say…we move out!!!</td>
</tr>
