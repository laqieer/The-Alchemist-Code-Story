<td>It's the only logical answer. At first, I thought she came up with the technique by herself, but…</td>

<td>How could anybody learn something so powerful so quickly? Besides…</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I remember Amane saying something about hearing voices, and seeing visions that were not her own.</td>

<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Unlike Amane, I cannot access that "power."</td>

<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Amane may act recklessly--even thoughtlessly, sometimes--but she's also innocent and naive…a normal, kindhearted girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>If anything sets her apart…it must be her ability to access that power. Don't you think?</td>
</tr>

<tr>

<td>If, somehow, they wind up threatening our safety, you'll have to be purged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>…and Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ugac.png" alt="Ugachi" height="128"><br>Ugachi</td>

<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>I don't know who or what I am. I can't tell if I'm in control of my own actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Amane said something like that before. But right now, the person standing here is me--Blade Fox Corps Third Squad Captain Tanosuke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ugac.png" alt="Ugachi" height="128"><br>Ugachi</td>

<tr>

<td>!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cele.png" alt="Celis" height="128"><br>Celis</td>
<td>Could it be the Discarnate Powers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/azam.png" alt="Azami" height="128"><br>Azami</td>
