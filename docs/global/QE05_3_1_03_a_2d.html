<td>Domestic conflicts? You mean like a coup d'état?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>Yes. The failed conquest of Saga has brought the discontent of our people to a head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>Chaos reigns in the capital, with riotous masses clashing against the military dispatched to suppress them. Casualties are high on both sides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>And the nobility are abandoning their country and people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Shamefully, yes. Most of the nobility has already lost any influence they once had over the country.</td>

<td>None but the Ceclidis family, the king's direct line, can fix this.</td>

<td>I came here in search of the people of my ancient lineage.</td>

<td>An ancient tribe, the protectors of the great tree, the Sephira.</td>
