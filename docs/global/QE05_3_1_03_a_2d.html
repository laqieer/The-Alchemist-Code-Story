<td>001</td>
<td>I cannot thank you enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I am Marie. A member of the Gluttony Foss gentility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ah, uh...I'm Mocca. This is Tina. We're from Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I see! No wonder your attire is so different from that of the people I've seen in the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I simply must reward you with something to express my gratitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Don't trouble yourself. We only did what was natural. We didn't do it to get—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, no. That wouldn't do! You have done me a great service, so please do let me repay you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'll lose my sense of nobility if I don't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Can we ask you something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>On our way here, we saw many fallen travelers from Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What's happening in that country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Gluttony Foss is...having some domestic conflicts at present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Domestic conflicts? You mean like a coup d'état?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes. The failed conquest of Saga has brought the discontent of our people to a head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Chaos reigns in the capital, with riotous masses clashing against the military dispatched to suppress them. Casualties are high on both sides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And the nobility are abandoning their country and people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Shamefully, yes. Most of the nobility has already lost any influence they once had over the country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>None but the Ceclidis family, the king's direct line, can fix this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then that whole Saga invasion was also...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I presume so. I understand how you, the people of Saga, must feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Though I may be powerless, I am still a noble of Gluttony Foss, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Your anger is mine to bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I owe you my life. If you wish it, I will gladly place it in your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ah, no, we don't—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>However, I would ask that you please allow me time to accomplish my mission first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I came here in search of the people of my ancient lineage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>An ancient tribe, the protectors of the great tree, the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You're one of the Sephira?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So this is Bandit's Nest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh, come on! Do you have any idea what I had to do to get this?! Can't you give it a better price?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hell no! Look at this scratch, you idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Works of art go way down in value if you get them scratched up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hey, buddy! Wanna play a game? Wanna try your luck?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This place is worse than I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yeah, but it might be the perfect place to gather information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We'll see what we can find out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Please do, but be careful. Try not to cause trouble with the locals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We won't be able to ask anything if we end up starting a fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Understood, Captain. We'll meet you in the square in an hour.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You seem accustomed to this sort of thing. I didn't think the military trained their soldiers to conceal themselves in a crowd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well, we've had to move around a lot since leaving Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I suppose we have acquired some stealth skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I see—but you're still naive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I believe I told you that it is sometimes necessary to take risks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Isidore...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The hell, bro?! You just bumped into me on purpose, didn't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Isidore! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What? You got somethin' to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Allow me to apologize. He's had a long trip. We're all very tired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What the—? Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I think you're the one who owes us an apology.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You son of a—! I'm gonna knock your teeth in!</td>
