<td>Hey, I understand now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>As someone who's undergone so much bride training, I realized what I'm lacking is rehearsal as a bride!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I mean, the more I think about it, I realize what I was doing was practicing to become a good wife...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And I don't know anything about what kind of feelings the bride is supposed to have on her wedding day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Or what the wedding itself is like!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, um...weddings...right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hey, Vanekis! I'm being serious here! Listen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What's going on? Did you say bride? What about the bride?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Tamamo! That's right! I'm talking about the bride on her wedding day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That sounds like fun! Hey, how about we have a festival!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A festival?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes! Eve is always wearing a wedding dress, but we don't, right? Let's have a festival where all of us are wearing wedding dresses!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Interesting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hey, Kon! Can you do something about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Kon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What? Can you use your nine-tailed power to transform clothes as well? Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Let's try!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Wow, you did it! You did it! I'm a bride! Hey, everyone, let's try this together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Seriously, what's going on here?! Oh, Tamamo, you're dressed as bride! Nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Vanekis, you try it too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huh, me?! Nah, it wouldn't suit me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh, what?! Eeek! He-hey, Tamamo...?! Wh-what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hey, our mission is here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Aswald, you're gonna be a bride too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh?! Wh-what are you doing?! Huh...this outfit...no way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Quickly turn me back! Tamamo, are you planning on going on the mission like this? I won't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What?! Come on, it's fine! I mean, it matches all of you really well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's not fine...this outfit is really hard to move in. We won't be able to complete our mission...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It'll be fine, it'll be fine! Right, Kon? More importantly, we need to hurry!</td>
