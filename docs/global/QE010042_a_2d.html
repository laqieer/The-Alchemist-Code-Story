<td>Bertrand</td>
<td>As you can see... Lord Gabirond's motives are tinged with a strong desire to conquer Wratharis.</td>

<td>Bertrand</td>
<td>Of course, his goal is to annihilate the remaining rebels. However, under that banner, it is quite likely he will not hesitate to eradicate the citizens of Wratharis as well.</td>
