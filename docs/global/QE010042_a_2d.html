<td>The scouts have returned. They've found a village where the Wratharis soldiers are hiding.</td>

<td>I'll go take the report. Bertrand, I leave you in command here.</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>The village is close. It is possible that Wratharis soldiers will launch a surprise attack. Don't let your guard down.</td>

<td>What did you mean earlier when you told me to be wary of Lord Gabirond?</td>

<td>As you can see... Lord Gabirond's motives are tinged with a strong desire to conquer Wratharis.</td>

<tr>
