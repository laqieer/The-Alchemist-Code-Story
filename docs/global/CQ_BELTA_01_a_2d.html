<td>Spick-and-span, kaboom, kablam!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Are you, er, polishing your cannon again, Bertha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's gotta be perfect! After all, today's the Artillery Regiment's public performance! I really hope everyone enjoys it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Enthusiastic as ever, I see. Still, you mustn't let your preparations get in the way of your duties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well, you've come a long way as a knight. I'm sure you'll do fine; just don't get carried away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(As a knight, huh...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(I might be prepared to fire my cannon on someone in order to protect someone else, but still...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(That's how I know I'm not ready. I've got a long way to go.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(If I want to protect more people, I've got to keep improving my skills as a gunner. I'm just not good enough yet.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hey! Bertha! It's almost time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>R-right! Oh, no! For right now, I'd better focus on the performance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Whoa! Hearing that cannon fire up close really clears out your ears, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>They're doing a mock battle next! I can't wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yay! It looks like everyone is enjoying themselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You... You're the girl who was firing that cannon up there, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh? Oh! Yes! That's right. I'm Bertha of the Envylia Royal Knighthood Artillery Regiment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The name's Chao. I came to watch your knights perform, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I noticed that you lacked a certain element of...professionalism.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>H-huh?! Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>To be clear, your aim is precise and your handling of the cannon is smooth and able. However, you put too much force into your every action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>On the battlefield, a delay of even a fraction of a second can change the course of an entire war. You're small, so perhaps you ought to consider how your size affects your movements?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>S-small? Aw...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Perhaps it is the fact that you wield a weapon so much larger than yourself that it causes you to subconsciously use unnecessary force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>W-well, this time we used a powerful cannon to make the show more fun for the people watching, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You noticed all that detail, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmph. Please! It is elementary for one such as I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(He sure has sharp eyes. Who is this guy?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>At any rate, I suppose I should acknowledge how impressive it is that one of your...diminutive stature can so adeptly handle a cannon of that size.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>S-stop calling me small! You're only a tiny bit taller than me anyway!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You don't see me using a cannon, do you? Besides, I am not short. I am merely still growing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So am I! Who are you, anyway?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Curious, are we? Fear not, I shall tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>During the mock battle, you will do exactly as I say. Then you will see, and know all there is to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What? But... I mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ah, I see. You do not trust me, I take it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's not that I don't trust you, exactly... You just kinda came out of nowhere. Now you're expecting me to follow your commands? Seems kinda...fishy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Besides, you're just some kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Indeed? Then that means you had all your shortcomings pointed out to you by a mere child, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Don't believe me then. It's nothing to me if you end up stuck as a worthless, washed-up underling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>However, should you decide to do as I say, you will find yourself outperforming your fellow knights... You would make an excellent pawn on the battlefield, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I look forward to watching your performance, however subpar it might turn out to be. Farewell for now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>H-hey! Hold on a second!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Oi! Bertha! What're you standing around chatting for?! You should be preparing for the mock battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>O-oh no! I'll get to that right away!</td>
</tr>
