<td>Haven't got a clue. His clothes are those of a desert tribe, but they certainly aren't ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I see...</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So, you're not from here, either. How can this be? This was the last village near enough for a child to have traveled from, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I have to ask, is there any way your people could take him in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm really sorry, but that's just not something we are prepared to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Our fields were swallowed by the sands because of the drought a couple of years back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We manage to scrape by, thanks to traveling merchants who sell us water, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We would be hard-pressed to afford another mouth to feed with all of our young people gone up north to work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I see...</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>All the villages have given similar rejections.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It used to be understood that there was no way to survive the brutal conditions of this wasteland without empathy and generosity, but times have changed in this turn of scarcity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Burning thirst and the sun blazing down upon us all used to be a constant reminder of the importance of cooperation, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Perhaps it is the prolonged civil war which has hardened the hearts of the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Um, sir? Thank you, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This is the way it is now. I guess maybe my village cast me out to reduce the number of mouths to feed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't want to be a burden on you anymore. I'll take care of myself from now on.</td>

<td>Child of the sun and sand, do you have the courage to leave this land?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Even without your memories, you are a member of the desert tribes. It may be right for you to live and die in this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>However, if you are willing to consider another course, even if it means turning your back on your home, consider coming with me to the royal capital.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The royal capital?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The royal capital of Gluttony Foss, Eos, is surrounded by mountains, but is the commercial center of the North where people and goods of all manner are assembled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>There may be someone who can help you there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But...you've done so much for me already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I am not unwilling to do it. The question is whether you are willing to do what it takes to survive, even if it means depending on another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If you are, come with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You would make a welcome companion on my journey. We can help each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I-I'll come! I'll go to the royal capital with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Very well. Then we will leave at first light. Be sure to get some sleep tonight. You'll need it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
