<td>Our fields were swallowed by the sands because of the drought a couple of years back.</td>

<td>We manage to scrape by, thanks to traveling merchants who sell us water, but...</td>

<td>We would be hard-pressed to afford another mouth to feed with all of our young people gone up north to work.</td>

<td>Um, sir? Thank you, but...</td>
