<td>Arghh!<br>How can you be so powerful, even though it was an incomplete transmutation?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hehe, you're so rusty. It seems like you haven't had a worthy opponent for the past 20 years!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I shouldn't have expected any less from the legendary Blossom Knight, who was said to be the secret power of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(But I can't afford to lose here! If the present Blue Flame Guard were to succumb to the Wratharis of the past, it'll give rise to new conflict!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I don't have a choice but to use it...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I seem to be out of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What is happening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's unfortunate that I wasn't able to witness the secret Alchemy that you used against Caesar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Tsk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But it's okay.<br>Just the fact that you were about to use it is good enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The message must have gotten across. We were more than mere victims. As long as you know that, it's enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This rose design... This knife must have acted as the catalyst to summon her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The people of Wratharis must have really put their deepest wishes into this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I suppose the Dawn of Wrath never ended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(When will this ever... no, let's not even go there. Let's just do whatever I can to get even just one step closer to that future.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...That concludes my report of the quelling campaign.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Good work, Zeke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>By the way, Captain Zeke, what happened to this catalyst that the Wratharis rebels used for the transmutation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It is not in existence any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You did not retrieve it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I eliminated it, of course. If we would have kept it, it could have become a new seed for disaster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tsk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Now I think of it. I heard about rumors that the Holy Guard has been searching not only for Philosopher's Stones...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>but also for catalysts of powerful phantoms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, though they could possibly cause disaster, collecting them to maintain balance in the world is also one of the Holy Guard's functions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Then I was right to have it eliminated. Or what? Do you think there was anything wrong with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No, there was nothing wrong with it.<br>Right, nothing at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The children are waiting for me outside.<br>I will take my leave.</td>
