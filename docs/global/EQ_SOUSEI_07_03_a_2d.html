<td>Don't you think it's a little cruel to lock me up now that I've come back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Priestess of Ouroboros... You, who will reveal a new path to us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Roh Ku is looking for you, for the Mammon subjugation ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh my, is he? So that's why you came for me yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Even though you are the Master of this Beltâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Avaritia Belt's symbol of armament and power. Kubera.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Your useless self-effacement and pointless humility are unnecessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We only need strive for strength. The path to true power is the sole purpose for the people of Avaritia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You told me you can impart that knowledge to me. Can you not, "Temptation Snake"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's not my name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But I did make a promise, so I'll teach you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You want a way to steal the weapon born from the twisting of truth of the world, the power of a dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Where...am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>

<td>Yna? How long are you going to sleep in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're finally awake! Even if you stayed up late last night, you can't sleep in till noon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Benika!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Whoa! What's with you, big brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Did you have a nightmare? You're such a scaredy cat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You may be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh? Are you really okay? You're acting strange...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You usually say "There is no weaker human in this Belt, Benika."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That was... Those were just jokes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I know. You don't care about how strong someone is, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Plus, I am weak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's not something to be proud of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Eheheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Don't overdo it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I know, I know. But the pain from the corruption isn't so strong today, so I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(This is definitely the Avaritia Belt. And this form is...my younger self?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(Which means, I was blown into the past...and merged with my former self?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(I don't understand. If I were Nimul and had this amount of information, I would have thought of some sort of hypothesis.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Luke! Din dins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Skree, skree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Benika, where did that animal come from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, um... It was a stray. From your master's workshop's...uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Nameless Isle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yeah, that's right! It was hurt, so I treated it and it became attatched to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Are you even capable of taking care of it properly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yes, of course I can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>All right then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(Benika started caring for that animal, Luke...the month before this Belt was destroyed.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(Which means there's no time. But... But I...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You can't tell me you're not interested. Wouldn't you like to see your sister again, Yna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(What should I do?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh yeah. You're going to your master's workshop today, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh, uh, yes... I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Um, do you remember what day it is today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(Right. Today is...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(It should be all right. I have memories of returning home today.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Your birthday, right? Don't worry. I will return home before it gets dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I also have a present for you. Look forward to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You promise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yes. I'll be back soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Have a good day, big brother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It's just as I remembered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>My hometown...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>If it isn't Yna. Are you heading to the workshop right now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Indeed. Master called for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>It's rare for that misanthrope Roh Ku to ask for anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>He must really like you. I'm sure you'll become a great smith one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>That would be nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>We're all looking forward to the day you'll make us some strong weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It makes sense, since it is the same past I lived through before, but they never change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Avaritia soldiers only train and strive for strength. They are the most covetous of the seven regions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>If what lies ahead for them is destruction, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What should I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>No answer will come today. But there is still time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>First, I must go to Master's workshop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Groooooooaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Damn. Master's workshop is just a few steps away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>(The me of this time was not as adept in battle as I am now. I do not know how well I will do, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I have no intention of just lying down and letting you kill me. You will get out of my way, or die!</td>
