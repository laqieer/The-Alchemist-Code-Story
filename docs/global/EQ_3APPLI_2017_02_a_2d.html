<td>Lisbeth and the others defeat the monster and head to the deck of the ship where Amaterasu is being cornered.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ack...huff...huff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, there's someone over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I've got this. Lisbeth, please continue forward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>My power...I can't use it to its full extent...ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ugggrraaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hyaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Uggrraaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We somehow made it! Um, Amaterasu, right? Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Y-yes! Thank you for coming all the way here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Let me introduce myself again. I'm Amaterasu. Everyone, thank you for coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I am Laevateinn. I told the other three, but I'm a Killer Princess and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wait, do you understand what I mean when I say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Actually...not really. But I'm assuming princess means you're an aristocrat of some kind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No...actually, maybe the "killer" part describes me better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Umm. Are you an assassin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's a bit of a hassle to explain it all so we'll go with that for now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Heheh...I'm Yuri.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm a kunoichi who is training in a village in Zipangu that is outside of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In the battle just now I realized that your physical capabilities were far beyond that of a regular person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If you're still in training then...I'm highly impressed by these kunoichis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Um...I'm Lisbeth! I'm a witch who attends Venus School of Magic...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hey, Amaterasu, do you know what it is that I'm good at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes! You're a witch...so you're good at magic, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Haha. You're right! Although at school I get pretty bad grades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I don't know if that means you're good at it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's very encouraging that such reliable people showed up. And who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm <p_name>... I'm a regular person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I couldn't do anything in that battle just now. To be honest, I don't really know why I'm here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh, then how about you take on the role of "thinker" to make up for me not being one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh? I'd assumed that being a witch makes you smart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>My best friend usually always does the thinking for me. Ack. Even amongst witches, there are a lot of different types of individuals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ahahaha. Okay, got it. I'll do my best to come up with ways to be useful to you all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>All right. Thanks! Um...I guess that's it for introductions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes. I think I understand all of you very well now. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>All right then, I'd like to ask for help from all of you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Please, help me regain the Sun Keys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Of course! That's the plan! There's no way I can stand by and watch the sunlight disappear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Amaterasu, you explained a lot before we met face to face, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Is there anything else you'd like to inform us about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>In that case, I'd like to explain my role properly again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>My role is managing the sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>All living things need the sun to survive. It is the source of life that exists in all words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>But the light of the sun is too strong...so it needs to be managed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>If it is not firmly managed it will burn everything in the world...that's how much power it has.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It can't be too much or too little...I manage it so that all living beings can get by comfortably.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>My home country of Lustburg is a bit cold...do you think you can strengthen the light a little?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry...but if I did that then the people in the rural areas will have problems getting by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Each world has one sun, so if you change its strength, it'll affect the entire world as a whole...I guess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Do you know exactly how the sun can lose its light?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yes. If you use the moon to hide sunlight...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Additionally, if you stop the moon and completely hide the sun, then the sun's light won't fall on the world anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huh? Can the Sun Keys also control the moon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>When it comes to managing the sun...the position of the sun, moon, and the world in relation to each other is important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>To be specific, I move the sun and moon using the power of the Sun Keys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>In each world I adjust how much light shines...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Oh, that's a lot of talk about physics and science!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Well...I'm pretty stupid...so I don't really understand it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Huh?! Um...to explain it in simple terms...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>For example, Lisbeth, let's say I was standing between you and Yuri.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>By doing so you wouldn't be able to see Yuri's face well, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yes, but I'll be able to see your face well, Amaterasu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Yes. That's why if I move to the side...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hi, Lisbethâ™ª</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Aha! I can see you, Yuri! Hi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>In this way, by adjusting the visible range, you can adjust the intensity of the light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hey...why are you guys playing around? The world is in danger and you guys are acting completely carefree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Right...Amaterasu, you said that all the keys were taken, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Then what is this key that I have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That's...well, right after the keys were stolen I tried desperately to regain them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>When controlling the sun and the moon, there is a place called the Twilight Zone which is where all the doors to each world exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>At that moment, I was in the Twilight Zone focused on operating the sun and moon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>It was around the witching hour where I had to make the switch between noon and night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>That's why I couldn't respond immediately when the intruder appeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>The intruder also put a curse on me and weakened my power significantly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I was only able to take out four keys...and the intruder tried to pursue and regain those as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You sent the keys you brought out and called for our help, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Amaterasu, you can control the sun. You must have an incredible amount of power, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>What kind of intruder has the power to take advantage of you and cast a curse on you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I guess you could call her the Fallen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Someone who discarded everything she needed to survive as a human: her good judgment, morality, and pride...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>In trade for that, she received a terrifying amount of negative energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Not only is she powerful, but she's sharp...a tough opponent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>This key...is the final key that's left to us now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Yes, it's the Sun Key for this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>That means that if you use that key we can restore the sunlight above now, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Oh...the sun is supposed to be operated from the Twilight Zone, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>That means that we'll need to drive out the Fallen who is there and regain control of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Well, that person has the keys as well so it's perfect, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>...But how would we get to the Twilight Zone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Amaterasu can go there, so wouldn't it be easy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>No. The Fallen did something...and I can no longer get back there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Then there's no other way to go?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Well, that's why I prepared this ship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>This is a legendary ship that can go anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Also...this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Amaterasu pulls out a radiating Golden Compass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>No matter what world we're in, this Compass will show the location of the Twilight Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>So if we follow this Compass and use this mysterious ship, we'll definitely be able to arrive at the Twilight Zone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Hmm...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Without this Compass, I would get lost, so I've been carrying it around with me, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Let me see...you hold onto this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Wh-why me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I'll explain the reasoning later. Let me tell you just one thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Only "one who is worthy" can hold that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Amaterasu presents the Compass with a grave expression on her face. <p_name> hesitantly takes it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td><p_name>, where is the Compass pointing to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Sorry. Before we leave, there's one more thing I'd like to confirm. Is that all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I know I'm the one that asked for your help, but...the Fallen is a dangerous opponent. Who knows what danger we may face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Are you certain...you'd like to help me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Of course! After all, if the sun disappears...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I told you earlier, but I come from a snow country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>It's already cold enough as it is. If it gets any colder...that's gonna be a big problem!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>If the sunlight disappears then it'll ruin my home country's sunflower fields...I'll never be able to see them again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I won't be able to take naps under the warm sun...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Besides...if the sun disappears...everyone will start thinking negatively and our worlds will become darker places. That's terrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Yes. I can't imagine a world without the sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Thank you...everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Somehow, I feel like a ray of sunlight has reached my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Amaterasu's eyes glistened as if basking in the sunlight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>All right then...let's head to the Twilight Zone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Let's hurry up and beat the Fallen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Yes! Let's get back the Sun Keys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Let me see where the Compass needle is pointed. Oh, this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>A ship, a key, and a compass...I feel like we're in some kind of pirate tale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Tr-true...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>That's quite spot on actually. This ship...it used to belong to a legendary pirate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>In other words, this is a pirate ship?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Yes! Oh, that's right...<p_name>, here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Huh? What's this hat...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>What says pirate captain more than this hat? I prepared this for you along with the Compass, <p_name>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>St-stop, it's embarrassing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Oh, my bad. I meant to say Captain <p_name>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Like I said...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Heheh. Take command of this ship...Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Captain, hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Aye aye, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>The four of them look at <p_name> with carefree smiles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Jeez...fine. After all, unlike all of you, I can't fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>I can just look at the Compass to see where we need to go, so...okay...I'll take on the role of captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>All right then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Avast, ye scurvy dogs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>...Looks like someone's overplaying it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Set sail!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>With an "Aye aye, Captain!" the four of them shout as they raise their hands up high.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>To restore the sun to all the worlds...to regain the Sun Keys...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Thus, their voyage begins towards the Twilight Zone where the Fallen awaits them.</td>
</tr>
