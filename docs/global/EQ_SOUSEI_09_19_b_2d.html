<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Hmph. Didn't feel a thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>My magic bullets, burned away? That's pure magil, eradicated. How fascinating! So this is the power of Wrath, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hyaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That blow should've dealt considerable damage. Why are you smiling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>This? Yes, it is certainly not a strike I can ignore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>When one's back is to the wall, though, what else is there to do but smile and laugh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>To be honest, I feel as though I've met my natural enemy here today, as resistance to magil is something I cannot so easily overcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Really, now? In that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...It's time to tie this up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes, let's. You seem to be at your limit as well, after all. Besides which, I believe the preparations are now complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...! Andechs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ghh... What is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>A-Andechs!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I think you're mistaken about why he's here. He's a Fallen, and Fallen cannot oppose the sins they've fallen to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>For him, joining you in battle was a desire that was simply impossible to resist, I surmise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>With this, the tables have been turned. This is where it ends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>For you, perhaps!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I will not allow anyone to bend His Majesty's will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh? It seems I made a critical error.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It was foolish of me to think that there would be no more of you to jump into the fray. Haha. It would seem this world is...full of surprises...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Andechs! Your Majesty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>In the end, I've exposed you to the ungainliest parts of me. Not quite the legacy you hoped I'd leave, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Does it matter? We won.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...! Andechs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Your wounds...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I might have overdone it a little. But then, you came all the way here! I think you're pushing yourself farther than I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I was sent here by the witch from Luxuria Belt and her pair of apprentices using the last of their power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>My Scarlet Blade has the ability to cut through magil and corruption. They thought it might come in handy. And it would seem it did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Is that so? I' must say, you really did come through for us. You've become a fine knight...or rather, you've always been one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Andechs, you're really hurt. We should get you out of this tower, right away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And, Your Majesty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm sorry to ask you for a favor after you've already come so far and fought so hard, but would you hear me out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Could you deliver a message? There's someone waiting out there for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What do you want me to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>"You've done so well. You're a truly wonderful, upstanding knight." If you could just...tell her that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>As you wish. I'll make sure she gets the message.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I appreciate it. I'll just...rest a little, for now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Rest well. You've earned it, Sir Andechs, renowned Knight of Justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I pray that no one ever disturbs your peace again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Your Majesty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Make sure to pass along that message. As for me... I have not yet fulfilled the task for which I was summoned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The message will be delivered, Your Majesty. You can count on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Sir Andechs, for all your bravery and effort to come to nothing at this point would be unthinkable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>So there is but one thing I can do to ensure it does not...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Is it just me, or are these guys syncing up their attacks pretty well?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It's more likely a matter of congruence. Lightning tears through the skies, and quakes rock the ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>They each cover where the other cannot. Both monsters are individually more than capable of carnage; put together, they are more formidable than I'd ever imagined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Grgh! And if the ground keeps giving way like this, we won't have any left to stand on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Engineer Soldiers, full speed ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>All right, that should've done—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Haaaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Curses! They don't have enough armor to get through the lightning! They're collapsing one after another, like houses of cards!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>It appears to be the worst possible combination for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>If only we could somehow separate them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Haaaaaaeeeee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>A lightning rod...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What if we could get Mammon's lightning to strike Belphegor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That might be possible. Belphegor's body is covered in something that seems rather metallic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>It could very well be conductive! We just need to find some way to get lightning to strike the top of its body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I think I know just the thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Wait, what're you doing, old dog?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Not going to make any quips this time. I just think that as the elder one here, it's my duty to put my life on the line when the situation calls for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You don't mean—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>All of the Gears of Judgment have been completed. I've done all that I ever set out to do. This should be it for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>As a warrior of Avaritia Belt, my life will be my blade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Buy me time until I can mount Belphegor, if you'd please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Have you completely lost your marbles?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Grooooaaaaar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Two beats... A pause... Three beats...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Old dog, are you seriously trying to predict Belphegor's quakes?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>After spending my entire life smithing weapons? Yeah, this isn't going to be much of a problem at all. I know rhythms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>And there's a rhythm to it. When the big guy makes the ground shift, he's gotta time it just right to make sure the wave it generates is as strong as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Grrrraaaarrrrggggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...! Stop! Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Great cover, Adaleigh! Keep it up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>"O Lord, though to supplicate is to be impertinent—"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Alchemy and smithing aren't all that different, when you get right down to it. I'm gonna go out as a master of 'em both!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Gotta put that Ku title of mine to good use, after all—make sure I live up to it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Witness the power of my life's work: the Principle Blade "Taurus"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Guah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Grrooooooooooooarrrrrrrrrgghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Just as I thought!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>It's different from our Mammon. This one is untamed, acting on impulse alone. It's got no discernible intelligence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Tremble and repent, you berserk beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Grooooaaaar!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Old dog! That's enough! Get away, already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>No, not yet! My sword still bears its hidden power: the Twin Fangs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Feel the sting of your own power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Grraaaarrrggghh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Did...it work?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Yeah, and you're somehow still alive, too! Jeez, what were you thinking?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Sorry... But, now we can catch up with Nimul and the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Wait. Is it just me, or is the scenery...changing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>This magil... Adaleigh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I'm on it! Engineer Soldiers, front and center!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>These flames...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>They're...reinforcements?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Grrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Grooooooooooaarr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>A third Cursed Beast?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>That's good, though. The more of Ouroboros' power we can knock out here and now, the easier it'll be to win the final battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Give me a break, you old dog! You're already beat up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>It's my years of experience and training that's gonna see me through this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I'm a living testament to the Avaritia way of life, after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>And I want nothing more than to push myself to the limit at least one more time before I die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>But I'm hardly in any shape to do it alone. So, how about it? You ready to teach this old dog some new tricks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>What, am I supposed to say no?! Of course I'll help you! We're friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Wait. What was that? Did you hear that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Yeah. It was Nimul's voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>And I can feel it in the magil around us, too. This is the Alchemy Nimul said he was going to give us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Grrrraaaarrrrgggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Here they come. But I think we've got some reinforcements of our own to surprise them with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I see. So this is what you had up your sleeve, Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Look! Another Belt Region's Cursed Beast! Absolutely enthralling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Hmm. I feel like this is a bit late in the game to go resurrecting me! But, whatever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>If it's my dear little brother's request, I guess I'll go along with it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>You're just so precious, though, talking all big but then coming to your dead old sister for help! Ooh, it just makes me so hap—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I-I've changed my mind! Let me pick someone else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Hahaha! No takesies-backsies, I'm afraid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Lord Kubera! If I could ask you, just this once, to join us in battle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Of course. That's why I've come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>So, let us show this beast our true power—your true power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Haaaaaargh!</td>
</tr>
