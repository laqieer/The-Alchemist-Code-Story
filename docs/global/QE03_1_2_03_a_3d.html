<td>Sigh... Honestly, poor people are inferior in everything they do.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Alma, why don't you stop hanging out with this poor individual and join me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm more athletic than even you are, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...You're right.</td>

<td>One day you'll succeed to the position of Court Mage so I can see the advantages of being friends with you.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Alma...?!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Heheh. I take care good care of my friends, you know?</td>

<td>Influence is something that is achieved when people gather around you. You have influence because you're rich. Everyone gathers around money.</td>

<td>014</td>
<td>That's the problem with the people around you, Rebecca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's all about powerâ€”the raw energy to make things move your way. I think it's a little too superficial to call them your friends.</td>

<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I've decided out of my own free will to be friends with Liz. After all...look.</td>

<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I...did it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I did what you said, Alma! I believed in the Broom Ace and I was able to ride it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's more fun to see my friends experience moments like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Thanks...Alma!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>All right then. Let's scatter these monsters and get out of here!</td>
