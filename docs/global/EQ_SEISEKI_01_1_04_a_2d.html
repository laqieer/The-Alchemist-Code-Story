<td>Huff...huff... Sorry, Chloe. You saved me again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. Anyway, I'm sure the monsters here are consuming Philosopher's Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That's why they're much larger than the monsters we've encounter until now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Does that mean there are Philosopher's Stones up ahead?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm sure of it! Let's hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ch-Chloe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hm? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Next time, I'm going to be the one to save you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I feel bad that you're always the one rescuing me. Next time, it's my turn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'll become stronger! So...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Heheh. Okay, Kanon. That's a promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Look! There's a large cave! I'm sure that's a mine for Philosopher's Stones!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We've arrived! This means we'll finally become Paladins! Yay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wait. It's a little too early to celebrate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Judging from the terrain, I'm certain this is a mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But there's not a single Philosopher's Stone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What? Did the other Squires take them all?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No, I don't think there were that many of them ahead of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Th-then, why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ohh! It can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What the...?! Are those the Squires who arrived before us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Th-they've...all been taken out! Is there an even stronger monster here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Monster? Now that's not very polite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Wh-who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Young Paladins, this will be your grave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh! It can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Heh... Do you know who I am, young Paladin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Chloe...who is he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>He's a knight of Wratharis...Zahar! In Wratharis, they call him a hero!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>In Envylia, there isn't a knight who hasn't heard his name!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I-is he that strong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Kanon, he used to be a knight of the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh?! A Paladin?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Are you from Envylia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Zahar...what are you doing here?! Why did you harm our fellow Squires?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Envylia, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>He's coming! Kanon! Be careful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
