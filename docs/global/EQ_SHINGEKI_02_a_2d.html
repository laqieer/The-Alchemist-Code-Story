<td>So...the seeds of despair have been sown again, before the world even has a chance to fully recover from the effects of the Lion Monarch's Charge. Hm? Is that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's...?! What is that?! This does not bode well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>As Lord Commander, I will protect this continent, and shoulder the will of those who came before me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So you are from a different world from ours...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And this...new kind of Giant Taurus is a threat from your world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is all a little difficult to understand, but it seems that we have at least established the situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Allow me to express my sincere gratitude. I thank you, warriors from another world, for saving my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmph. We will find this Titan...uh, Taurus, and the girl who was fighting it. I'm counting on you, Hange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>There's no wall in this world... Won't it be dangerous out there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's the point. It does seem crazy, but if what this guy says is true, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This is not our world. There is no wall here. They are completely unprepared for a Titan attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Dang it all... Even worse, we don't have any of the supplies we need, like gas or fresh blades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If that girl can really go head to head with a Titan without omni-directional mobility, then we will be needing her help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I just can't believe that we're in a different world. This is incredible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I don't know what's going on anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You will simply have to adapt. We need to contend with that new Giant Taurus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We must think carefully about what we can do to avoid further damage to the region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Drats!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hey! Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I need to protect my people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You are as shortsighted as ever, I see. This is this kind of behavior that led us to lose Alia, and put the entirety of Saga in grave danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Say what you like. I don't care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What do you intend to do, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I will return to the Water Temple, for the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I am concerned that Asena's condition may worsen as the threat of the Giant Taurus grows more pertinent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It weighs heavily on my mind, but you should know that neither Fuu nor I take this situation lightly, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Do not be so conceited as to think that only you care for the safety of the land and people of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I do not need a lecture, thank you very much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmm... It seems like the people of this world are not necessarily united, either. Oh? Who's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The twelfth Lord Commander, Basheeny, has arrived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You...! You came here alone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What have you been doing?! We sent you a request for reinforcements quite a while ago!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Do you realize how many people have been killed?! I thought the Holy Guard was supposed to help people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hey... Why don't you calm down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So you're here, too, Kazahaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm pretty sure I told you that I'd be sticking around for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Tehre... I'm sorry it took me so long to get here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I came as soon as I heard about this new type of Giant Taurus. Could you give me a run down of the situation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I see. So...it has a weakness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Does this mean your study of this Giant Taurus is going well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Indeed. From a sample of the beast that we happened to get our hands on, we have gathered that they are similar in structure to the Ancient Dragon Bone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That is, the remains of an ancient dragon that happens to be the largest mountain range in Saga, forming the border to Gluttony Foss. It will be incredibly difficult to pierce such rock-like hide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>And these are the creatures popping up all over the continent? I guess we'll need to do something about their armor first. That'll be our focus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Indeed. Not one of our attacks was capable of making a single scratch on the one we encountered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>These soldiers from another world said they'll help us out with the new variation. That's something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I watched them take down one of the beasts. It did not appear to be armored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I see. I think I've got a pretty good grip on the situation for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hey! Where are you going?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I only came here to get a better understanding of the threat these new Giant Taurus poses, so that I can take effective countermeasures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I cannot believe this! And you call yourself Lord Commander?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It's not only Saga that's in danger, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>If I cannot save everyone, I will take measures to save the greatest number of lives I possibly can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It seems that I was wrong to call on the Holy Guard for help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Now isn't the time for that kind of talk. Consider that the danger will only grow as time passes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What would you know? You are not from our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Is the investigation of the Giant Taurus progressing? Surely we can get our hands on a sample of skin or tissue, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It's important to study the enemy. We need to understand them, so that we can pinpoint their weakness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Now, then... What should I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You already know the answer to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Levi! Did you find the girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>No, I didn't. A man named Kazahaya told me to leave it to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>So I went to check on our defenses instead. Thankfully, it looks like we'll be able to fight with omni-directional mobility while we're in the vicinity of this temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>That's the only thing this place has going for it. Before we do anything else, it will need to be cleaned from top to bottom! Anyone who does a poor job will be severely punished!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Is that how you address your captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>R-right away, captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I don't think this temple is that dirty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>We have wounded soldiers here. Hygiene is important, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I suppose you have a point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Your first job will be to make a space for the wounded to rest! I do not want to see a single speck of dust!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That Giant Taurus... I can't wait...to see it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What can we do about that armor? Hmmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What is that?! Is that the new type of Giant Taurus?! It must be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>No! I'm surrounded! Is this a new Giant Taurus, too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>It looks a little different, though. Squishier. It'll be no match for my Mecha Weapon! I'll make it go splat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Huuzzzzaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Gnnnrrrrrrraaaaagggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Ngh! It's not working?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Dang it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Wh-who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You've got guts, and that weapon of yours is something else... You're just not striking the right place. You can't inflict a fatal wound on it that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>When you're fighting a big enemy like this, you need to know its weakness, and then attack it with everything you have. That's the best strategy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>For example...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Huurgghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Urrgggggaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>So...you slash its heels to bring it down and then go for the back of its neck?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>A Titan's weakness is its nape. There are several ways to get at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>This is one of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>The mechanics of your gear are amazing! I can't believe you can fly through the air with it! Where was it made? How does it work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Which knight order invented it? Actually, wait... Who the hell are you?! Whoa! The ground is shaking like crazy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Let's save the chitchat for later, all right? We need to take down these guys first! Give me a hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>You got it! Let's kick their butts! Then you can tell me all about that gear of yours!</td>
</tr>
