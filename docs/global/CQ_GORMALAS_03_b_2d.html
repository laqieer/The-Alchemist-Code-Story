<td>I found it! Finally, after all this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This ancient document existed before the alliance between the Seven Kingdoms of Babel. I'm certain it will help guide the way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Stop right there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...Gormalas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If you value your life, leave that there and put your hands on your head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If you don't hurry, your severed head will hit the ground first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...You scum!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's the biggest compliment you could pay me. Well then, what will it be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But I finally found it...the way to fulfill my ambition...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's got nothing to do with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Tsk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So, this scrap of paper is your treasure, huh? I'll have to take a good look at it later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Why are you glaring at me like that? If you want it, then take it. Or else you'll never get anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I told you...I'm not a villain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Then you'll have to give up on this treasure! You understand now, don't you? Some things you have to take in order to get your hands on them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...! I can still advance forward without that! I'll just need to make a bit of a detour!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'll handle it like I always do! I will never...become one of those who takes from others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hah. I take what I want. If I don't take, then others will take from me. That's what being a pirate is all about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If you want this back then you've gotta take it back from me. I'll be waiting for you, brat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's not like you, Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What isn't?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You spared that brat's life. You're always killing or selling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm interested to see...whether that brat will eventually change her ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ultimately, pirates are all villains! She can feed her naiveÂ drivel to the fish for all I care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You seem to be enjoying yourself, Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The world is a vast place. That means there are still plenty out there who will dare to defy us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'll steal everything from them and stand at the zenith of this wide blue sea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Follow me, you scurvy dogs! For I am Captain Gormalas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Aye, aye, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(I'll swallow this entire sea...with my own hands, I'll consume it all. That's the only way...)</td>
