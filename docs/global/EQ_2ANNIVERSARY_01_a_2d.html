</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Let's take a peek at the operations team preparing The Alchemist Code's first ever live event...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>There is a sense of anticipation as the team discusses what the event should include to make sure the fans have the ultimate experience.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>Indeed. It's amazing how far we've come! Everyone's worked so hard. I'm sure that the players will appreciate what we've done with this event.</td>

<td>——Drama! Strategy!</td>

<td>TAC Designer, TAC Artist</td>
<td>P-Producer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>I've been looking for you two. This event plan is lacking the punch to fully immerse people into the world of The Alchemist's Code!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>It is? I feel like we've already prepared everything we possibly can, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>What draws people to The Alchemist Code is the drama—and the strategy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>The goods, the cafe, and the exhibition will help people better visualize the world we've created, but where are the aspects that feature the strategy element of the game?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>I see! That's what you meant by "lacking".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Exactly. That said...since this is our first live event, I have absolutely no idea what we could do to highlight the strategy side of the game.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Hm... Our Phantom of the Kill game incorporates a lot of opportunities to interact directly with the players, so it's easier to come up with ideas, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>We mostly interact with players of The Alchemist's Code through the Nico Nico Live video streaming site, so something like that is the only thing I can really think of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>Yeah... What else might we do to feature the strategy elements other than releasing high-difficulty quests?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>——Aha! I've got it, Designer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Since we're not sure what the players would enjoy, we ought to use Nico Nico Live to tackle the players head-on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>That's... I mean, what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Designer, you'll be participating, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>——I see... So you meant that we should stream a Multiplay quest on Nico Nico Live in which we are the enemies that need to be defeated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>Oh, man... That's a relief. I get it now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Yes. I think this is the perfect way to solve our crisis! Use Nico Nico Live as a framework to battle directly with the fans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>"The true boss is...Producer?!" is the kind of thing we're going for, basically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>I'll be the ultimate boss challenge! Then in exchange for getting soundly beat by my skills, the players will have a chance to get some fantastic rewards!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>T-that's quite a plan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>We still need some element of humor in all this... Like some kind of Alchemist Code celebrity appearance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>Ah... What if we introduce a kind of celebrity summoning ability for your character?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>I-I don't know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Hm, I don't know how willing the players will be to attack someone like Artist. Maybe we could have her shield us instead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>I don’t think the ugly tension of "Will the players attack Artist or not?" is the kind of atmosphere we want to promote at our first event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>But not only would she be our shield, she would also play a role that supports the players!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>I-I see...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>We will unleash a powerful Strike when cornered, but players will be able to borrow Artist's ability to save themselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>What do you think? Isn't that a nice support role for Artist? I think the players will enjoy that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>I-I would be honored to take on such a role!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Wonderful! I know we can rely on you to give the players the best TAC experience they could hope for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Oh, and Designer ought to take advantage of that function which allows bosses to change form during battle! I mean, we developed it, we might as well use it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>And you...can do...that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>..."That"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>You know. That thing you do whenever we're on Nico Nico Live. That.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>What?! I've told you before, that was a misunderstanding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>I-indeed! His looks have no bearing on the kind of wonderful partner he is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>Artist... What... What are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Umm... Anyway, what about changing your unit's attack type mid-battle? Like, from a magic type to a physical type!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>I guess that could work...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Just me left, then... As the Nico Nico Live streaming progresses, I shall do my utmost to become the most powerful villain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>I'll make generous use of Cadanova's ability, Dragon Shift, to make the battle especially difficult for the players!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>And we'll set it up so players have to borrow Artist's strength to defend themselves...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>And then, once the players have defeated me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>You can reveal your special final combined form "Super Producer" that can give out lots of fantastic prizes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Heh... Perfect! We have to go all out for our first live event!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>No holds barred! Let's make the players work for their win against us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>I'll do my very best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Fantastic! I have faith that the two of you can make this Multiplay quest a wonderfully challenging experience for everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>So... No pressure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>I can already tell that this is going to be quite the journey...but I think the end result will be really good. This is inspiring!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Wait! Hold on! You're there to help the players for this event! So, on that note... I've got a bunch of work ahead of me. I'm going to go get started on that.</td>
</tr>
