<td>Julia! Stop this! If we fight, it'll just end up hurting Emmel—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Only Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Nimul, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Even though it was me who always loved you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(Julia felt like that? Preposterous. This is certainly a trick...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(No...but that look in her eyes. That's right, she always looked at me like that...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>"Shapeless shadows, thus become boundless!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ah—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Nim—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ha! You're just like I remember you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Always so consumed in your selfish ideals... Even now, you hold onto that naivete!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Awkward and insensitive, too weak to properly protect yourself... Yet you were Julia's first love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This is why I am filled with such disgust. Because I am no longer that girl with stars in her eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Nimul?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>For now, I have been satisfied. Be grateful that I shall spare you and take my leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I bid you farewell, Nimul. The next time we meet, you will be drenched in corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>She got away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Nimul, are you hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Stay back... Wagi...nau...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The corruption... She got me. If you touch me, you will also...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Can you heal him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>No, this isn't enough...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Like Nimul said, he's been corrupted. On top of that, it's deep down in the core of his body...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>This means that Nimul will become a Sinner at this rate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This isn't a matter of only healing his wounds. Even the very voices of the spirits that make up Nimul must be cut off from the corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Even for the Sephira, that's a nigh impossible task... Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>For now, let's tend to his injuries! Mira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ah, yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Do you have any other comrades? If you do, could you please bring them here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh, of course! I'll go super-quick! But it sucks that my connection with them got cut off earlier...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Waginau, please help support Nimul. I'll protect your body from the corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I have returned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Their ringleader, he who is named Nimul, has taken a direct attack of Beelzebub's corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Regardless of his potential in magil or willpower, he will become a Sinner by daybreak tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I see. Very well. That man poses quite the threat...but that is exactly why that had to be done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I am eager to see if he has what it takes to become an ally of ours. Will he, or won't he...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Now, I will take my leave. There remain the last of the Sephira to erase from this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Very well. However, if you are able to, refrain from killing as many as you can. The more humans you leave alive, the more that will fall into sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>J-Julia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Is this really what you wanted?</td>
</tr>
