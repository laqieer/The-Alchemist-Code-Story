<td>Hmhm. That battle went well. You've really loved TAC for a long time, haven't you? I can tell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>However... it would seem that it's time for us to say goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>A-already?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Your love for TAC is what pulled you into this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>However, the longer you stay here, and the more you grow to love this place, the weaker your love for TAC will grow, until you are no longer able to return to your world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>However, the tower has allowed me to open up a path for you, using your love for the world of TAC, and my own knowledge of your world and the game.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You won't get this chance again. Don't you wish to return?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>A little, but... I've made so many friends here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You won't be able to play TAC anymore, if you stay here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Haha... That's true. I wouldn't like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's what I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I hope your beloved TAC will only grow more wonderful from here on out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Did you forget already? One of the reasons this world exists is because you wanted to improve TAC.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Okay, then I'm going to get my demands out there and hope the world listens! First off, hurry up and update the story already! And while you're at it, do something about the EXP! I'm getting deja vu... Did I say all this already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh! And pump out some stories and other goodies for the characters who haven't had a chance to shine yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I hope your wishes will come true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wait! One more question. I've gotta know—what's going to happen to this world? Will we never meet again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's said that those who summon a girl at the foot of the legendary tower can find eternal happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, I suppose you didn't exactly summon me, but I wonder if there might not be some truth in that old legend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>C'mon, Kaya! Can't I get a straight answer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmhm. Allow me to add my hopes to yours, that your beloved TAC might grow ever more wonderful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>And, I think... considering that you grew to love this world, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So long as you don't forget about me, or this world; so long as you hold onto the love you hold in your heart for all of—for me... Then we will meet again. I'm sure of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>After all, you were the one who summoned me at the foot of this legendary tower. Eternal happiness is yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So it stands to reason that if our reunion would make you happy, it will occur—so long as you never let your love for TAC fade from your heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>TAC Memorial - Kaya Ending (Fin.)</td>
