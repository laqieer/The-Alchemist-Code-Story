<td>Hey. How many days has it been? That red-head is still lying motionless. Do you think he's dead?</td>

<td>No. When you get close to him...he keeps muttering things under his breath.</td>

<td>Seriously? Well, if you got close to him then you should have given him something to eat.</td>

<td>Villager B</td>
<td>Well...there's something disturbing about him.</td>
