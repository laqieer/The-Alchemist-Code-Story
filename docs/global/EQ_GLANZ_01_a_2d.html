<td>(I wanted to cleanse this tainted world.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(Whatever the reason, whether out of patriotism or personal beliefs, the world keeps getting more and more corrupted.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(So I refuse to love or be a part of this stained world.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(â€”That is what I thought.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Nothing. None of our teams have found what we're looking for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That can't be... According to the professor's research, the Philosopher's Stone lies within these ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>After all you've done here... I am sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's nothing. The stakes are too high for regret. We must do all we can to find some way of protecting this world from potential destruction. It's only a shame we didn't find anything here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes... However, something here is a little strange. It almost seems like it was here, but was taken by someone else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Are you about done?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yes, that is enough for today. We should head back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Before you were at my side in battle, today you are my escort through ancient ruins. We seem to find our way to each other. Could this be fate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Nonsense. This is just a job among other jobs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Must you sign a different contract each time? Wouldn't it be easier to just join the order? I could put in a good word for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>For me? Please don't. You're Wratharis's secret weapon. I wouldn't be able to live up to a recommendation from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That is simply not true. I know full well what you are capable of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're quite adept at coordinating with others in combat. It's very comforting to have you fight alongside me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You think too highly of me. I'm just a mercenary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So humble. Or self-effacing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I just think it would be convenient if I was able to speak more frankly about what we are doing here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>As in, for example, about the true goal of this mission that I was not informed of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>There are not many, even among the knights of Wratharis, that can fight shoulder to shoulder with me. Wratharis is in desperate need of capable warriors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Besides, I do believe we make quite agreeable business partners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm happy to hear you say that, but I'm content with where I am now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I prefer to not make long-term contracts. I hate to feel tied down, so I have no intention of associating myself with any particular faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>This must be how it feels to be dumped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh, don't be. I merely wanted to try my luck. Still, would you mind telling me what makes your conviction so immutable?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I just do not want to be involved with or be part of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Glanz? I want you to know that I meant it when I said it's comforting to have you fight alongside me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I know. Still, you're plenty powerful without me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That is true, but it is also true that there is strength in numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If you say so. Hm? What is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Grr... Rawr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>OW!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Glanz?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Th-this kid just bit me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hmm? What is going on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's what we want to know! You just bit my hand! What is with you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's very unwise to wake a bear from hibernation. Of course you end up getting bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You're not icky-sticky. I like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Rawr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Aaaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Icky-stickies right when I wake up. I hate that. I'm gonna beat you all down.</td>
