<td>I did it... Did you see, Father?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I leave...Saga...in your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'll...always be...watching over you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Father, I swear to protect the land where you lay in rest. Father...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I kept my promise, Father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We suffered heavy losses, but we overcame our tribal differences. All of Saga is walking together, hand in hand, toward a bright future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I will lead the Toxotes tribe in your stead, Father. I will serve my duties well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So please, watch over me, Father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's right, I'm the Chief now. It's what I must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What...I must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(It's because of me that Mocca...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(I have to do something. No... There's a part of me that just wants to do something.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(But...I can't. I have my duties as Chief.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(Then...am I supposed to just leave Mocca to her fate?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I just...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Father... What should I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>To cure Mocca of her curse...I'd have to leave Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then...even with the four Matters combined, Mocca's curse can't be lifted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That is correct. The corruption within her has progressed rapidly. It may be able to slow its progression, but it will not cure her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Isn't there anything that can be done?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You will find no cure for her in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That can't be true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Do not despair. I said you will not find a cure for her in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The cloth wrapped around Mocca's arm... The power imbued within it should slow the curse's progression.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If a Sephira like Georgios could be found, then we may be able to cure her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Is that true?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But you have your duties as Chief, Tina. Who will take on those duties for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This is my problem. I have no intention of dragging Tina into this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Mocca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I see...but Mocca, do you intend to leave Tamis behind as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Tamis will eventually become the next Wind Sprite, but she is still young. Does she not need you by her side?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I do not mean to threaten you with these words. I simply want to see your conviction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Be sure you think things through before you act. No matter what path you choose to take, I will be by your side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>My conviction...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Father... What should I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I leave Saga in your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Father...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I will come again. I promise I will have an answer to report by then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(Lezario's reparations seem to be going well.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's Tina! Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hey, Tina! The adults were all saying you're the one who saved Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It wasn't all me, you know? I couldn't have done it without everyone's help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Really? But we can still feel safe with you around, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That's what everybody is saying! Tina, they're calling you the hero of Toxotes... No, of Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I don't think that's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>But I believe it! I know that as long as you're here, you'll save us, no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>As long as I'm here, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The Jam! The Jam are at the village gate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Get the women and children out of here! Head toward the forest at the far end of the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Keep your distance from them! I'll take care of the Jam!</td>
