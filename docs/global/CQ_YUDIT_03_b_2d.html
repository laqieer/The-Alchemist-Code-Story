<td>Well, well, well.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>I guess we have to call that one a draw, huh? Aw, man... I still couldn't win!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But...that's okay. I'm satisfied with how I did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me you've found the answers you were seeking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I sure haveâ€”thanks to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I realized that I don't really want to create a weapon, but a mech gear that everyone can enjoy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Not something designed for war, but a tool that will entertain people for generations to come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's my ideal. That's what I believe in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>In other words, you want to create a weapon that no longer needs to function as one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>For that to be possible, you'd first need to create a world without war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Right! That's why my mech gear needs to be something that can spread peace throughout the land!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hmph. You're starting to sound a lot more confident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I feel it, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>And you know what? I realized something else, as well. If I'm going to realize this dream of mine, I'm definitely going to need your help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Imagine if we combined your Ultimate Blade with the greatest mecha that I can create!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I bet we'd end up with something absolutely amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You want to use me, do you? Keep in mind that I won't take on a job I don't agree with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I know...but just think!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If you join me in this endeavor, it'll ensure that your Ultimate Blade will live on, well into the future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wouldn't that be awesome?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You talk as though I've already forged the Ultimate Blade, but I haven't. As much as it pains me to admit it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Still...the idea of my ultimate creation being passed on to future generations does appeal. I'd never even considered it before now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Does...that mean you're on board?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hmph. We'll see. If that gear of yours is going to be applied to my work, it'll have to be perfect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You can count on that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>All right! This is going to be the greatest endeavor ever attempted in mecha history! We'll create something that's everlasting, to keep the world entertained for millennia to come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This is so exciting! I'm so hyped!</td>
