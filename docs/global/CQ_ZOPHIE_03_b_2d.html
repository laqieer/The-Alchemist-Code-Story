<td>Gah! If I can just land a hit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ah...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Argh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>As long as I have my medicine, a wound like that can hardly be called a wound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(Furthermore, to someone like me, who is used to the old family business, ruffians of this caliber are of no consequence.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Now then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Clean-up done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Nice job, Zofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh? Alexis? No injury? No hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No, I have secret medicine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wow! Wow, wow! It's magic! Were you gentle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Uh, something like that. Now it's time to be gentle with you. Look at you, you're covered in injuries again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You have to be more careful from now on. I won't always be here to heal you like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>May I do your examination while I heal you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. Gentle, right? Alexis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Of course. What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(The mark of an outcast?! This is the mark branded onto people who are deemed outsiders by the Holy Order. Could Zofia be...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Could this perhaps be the cause of her great power?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(Do the people of Gluttony Foss know this? Well...it has nothing to do with me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Alexis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's nothing. Your body is perfectly healthy. You just need to be more cautious about being injured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Now then, let's go back so I can give my report and then head home to Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Alexis...meet again? Come back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No farewell! Meet again! Zofia and Alexis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Alexis and Zofia friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ah, you're right. We're friends... Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(Could it be that...our appearance is similar and that's why...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ahahaha! Alexis not leaving yet! Together, together. Eat together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(I suppose, as long as this smile is before me, it's not a big deal, hm?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I suppose you're right. First, let's go eat together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yay! Hurry, hurry! Exciting! I'm excited!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Meet Alexis again, when?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I have to collect medicinal ingredients so I am sure I'll stop by for a visit very soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Aha, ahahaha! Yay! Next time! For sure! Promise! Our promise!</td>
