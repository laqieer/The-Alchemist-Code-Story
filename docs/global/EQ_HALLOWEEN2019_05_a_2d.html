<td>Look at yourselves. Are you not ashamed?</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>A little...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Halloween comes but once a year. I understand the compulsion to let loose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yet even so, that does not entitle you to just do whatever you want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You're right. Sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Halloween is supposed to be an event that children can enjoy! As their elders, you ought to be setting a better example.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yet here you stand, squabbling among yourselves and behaving poorly. How can you expect the younger generation to do anything different?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah, what she said!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Children...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Halloween is meant for us kids, but lately you grown-ups have been taking over! What kind of Halloween is that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What the hell do you think you're doing?! You'd better pipe down and do as you're told, squirts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>My, my. It is rather shameful to see an adult turn to anger when they're unable to find the words to defend themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Mei Fang!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Whose side are you on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Side? It is not so simple a matter as that. I am merely conceding that there is something to what the children are saying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Is that not so, Rosa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Heehee... You're right. After all, I haven't done anything. I'm just the one who listened to the bleats of these poor little lambs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Poor little lambs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Why is it okay for the grown-ups to do whatever they want on Halloween, but not us kids? That doesn't make any sense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So, since the grown-ups have hijacked our Halloween, we're gonna make a new Halloween of our own! And this one'll be decorated in red and black!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well said, my friends, well said. I will aid you in bringing your lofty endeavor to fruition as your very own Dark Angel of the Night!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What do you think you're doing, Rosa?! Inciting these children to misbehave is a serious offense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Now, doesn't that sound deliciously naughty? I thank you for recognizing me as the sinful blasphemer I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Numa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The time has come for a new Halloween, one gleaming in shades of crimson and pitch black! We will shape it with our own hands, and it will be ours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Numu...nu...num...numyua!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wh-what's wrong with that Ratty?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I dunno, but here it comes!</td>
