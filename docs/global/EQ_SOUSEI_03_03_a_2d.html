<td>Reactor, check! Fuel, check! It'll be a little rocky, so be sure to hold on to something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Really? You just got here! Aren't you a busy one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You didn't have to come with us, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I mean, I'd rather not get involved, but you've never entered the mines, have you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>To find the inspection team, you'll have to make your way to the underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're headed into a mine that's like a labyrinth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>People with no sense of the land here are bound to get lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I guess you're right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That means you'll need someone like me to guide you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You're familiar with the mines?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Of course. The mines on the surface below this city are under my father's control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Right. You're the son of the mayor of Redington.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That might not be good for much, but at least my knowledge of the mining tunnels can help you now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But listen, our first priority must be to rescue the villagers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Land the airship at these coordinates. It's the fastest way to get there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Roger that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This place is nothing like the floating city. I can hardly believe it's part of the same region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The buildings over there are quite simple, aren't they? It looks like they've been rebuilt a number of times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You're exactly right. And any time now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ah! That was an earthquake just now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This land is the lair of the Cursed Beast. Whenever it turns in its slumber, the shaking begins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The earthquakes get much worse than this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>When Belphegor is in a bad mood, villages around here are decimated instantly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's how much of a threat this region's Cursed Beast is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah... This is why I've gotta help save everyone from this suffering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Adaleigh, focus on the task at hand. What did we come here to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>To stop the Fallen that appeared in the mines, and to save Icona.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>To do that, you must stay focused on your mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yeah... You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well, would you look at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>W-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Nothing. Just thinking how you've mellowed out lately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Kinda gives me a jolt to see it. I might even say it's almost inspiring. Hello, there! How's it going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh, it's Mister Minario! What brings you here today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's too quiet here. Something is off. If the Fallen were just here, there should be more alarm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You're right. That voice on the transmission was panicking, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I don't want to worry the people here for no reason. Leave this to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hey, we're looking for someone. Anyone seen a lady engineer with a mechanical arm around here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I haven't, but I'll ask around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Please do! I really appreciate that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Not a problem at all! Anything for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh, wow. You're respected around here, aren't ya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well, I've picked up some respect while doing my job as a Detective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You know, the people here are different from the people in the floating city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ah, well. This is a ruthless land. In conditions like these, the only way to live is to support one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>They have to be different from the people above, who worry only about themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I'd like to do what I can to make life easier for the people here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>For now, the least I can do is listen to what the people have to say and act as a voice for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Well, there's no use in worrying about those things now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>First, we've gotta gather information and figure out where the inspection teamâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What was that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hey! What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>F-F-Fallen! They came welling up out of the ground with that earthquake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Dammit, we've been caught off guard! The villagers need to get to safety!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>That's no problem, but what about you, Mister Minario?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That's obvious! It's times like these that the people from "above" are supposed to do their jobs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Spiritbonding can handle the Fallen! Let's purify them before they harm the villagers!</td>
