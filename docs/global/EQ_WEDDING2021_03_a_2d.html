<td>Ugh! There are so many monsters on this path. Chihaya, help me out! Let's get these creeps!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I have an idea! I can use my dance to stifle the monsters' movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Thank you! Okay, let's finish them all at once. Woohoo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Is the effect of the dance wearing off!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(I wonder if being distracted by things is affecting my dance's power...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If that's the case, I'll try one more--!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Gyaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Chihaya! Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hiyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Shayna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We've already come this far! Time to wrap this up! Haaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Pfew... Somehow that worked out. Chihaya, are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm... I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But it's because of me that you're hurt... I'm so sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Don't give it a second thought! It's just a flesh wound!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't worry. You can't let the fear of getting hurt keep you from fighting, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Besides, I can think of this wound as a badge earned for protecting you. Nice, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh! You really are strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hehe! Thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Anyway, are you okay? Do you feel unwell?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Why do you ask that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's just that your dancing was so different than usual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Normally, it's wondrous in how you seem in total control down to your fingertips. Something seemed to be missing this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I...I'm sorry! I didn't mean to be rude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You weren't. It's nothing like that. As expected, the eyes of a trained warrior cannot be deceived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You're correct. My movements lack their usual finesse. I think I've been distracted by many unimportant things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm truly sorry for the trouble I've caused as a result.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You have seemed a little off ever since talking about the fair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Could there be something about weddings that upsets you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You said that marriage was the road to a happy life. The beginning of a happy life for two who love each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Y-Yes, I remember saying something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm not so sure that's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The dance I performed at a wedding was more for uniting houses than the happiness of lovers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Of course, I do not believe that all marriages are unhappy, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I can never forget the look of sadness and resignation I saw in the eyes of a bride when I performed at her wedding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I danced my heart out in prayer for everyone's joy. It was meant to strengthen the bond of the couple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But I'm not certain that's what she was hoping for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yet that sort of thinking is fruitless. That's just how marriage in Wadatsumi is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>At least, that was what I saw, so I continued to dance wishing for the couple's happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>But seeing everyone dedicate themselves for the happiness of others at the fair, I couldn't help but wonder...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Maybe it isn't always best to work hard for others' happiness, and... But I shouldn't think like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Chihaya...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It was the same as when I wished for the recovery of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I performed my dance as best I could to bless the hearts of the people of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm overjoyed to see the smiles on the happy faces of those who've come from all over to see the dance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>But I do not think it likely that my actions were best for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But the people of Wadatsumi smiled when they saw you dance, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Isn't that pretty great?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Various things occurred to me thinking how I like to make fans smile, like how hard it is to get everyone to smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>But you did that by pouring your feelings of wanting to make everyone happy into your dance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>There are many different situations, but you wanted to cheer people up and were able to make them smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Your dancing is amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Shayna... Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I was just thinking... Don't you think we're a lot alike?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You mean us? Me and you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Yes! You did do your best to make others happy, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I also want to do whatever I can to make my fans happy... Yes! We're definitely the same!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>W-Well, I... I don't think I'm strong like you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Besides, what I did was--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Stop! What are you doing!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That voice... Did it come from that studio up ahead!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Oh no! It looks to be under attack! We have to go help!</td>
</tr>
