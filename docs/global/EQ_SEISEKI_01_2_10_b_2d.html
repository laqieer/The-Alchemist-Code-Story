<td>Ca-Captain!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ack! I...I told you, didn't I? Don't be swayed by your emotions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But...this it how it should be! I'll...take him down with me!</td>

<td>U-ugh... Wh-where am I?</td>

<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Discarded by fate, you drift between multiple worlds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That voice...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This is the Door of Truth, where souls are judged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I am Ouroboros—the observer of destiny who bonds this world with truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Answer me this. Do you wish to possess power? With immense power...you can save him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Kanon, you lamented about how you couldn't master Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh? Y-yes, I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Sign a contract with her. In doing so, you'll be able to grasp the truth of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>R-really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Then, use that power to seal both him and me behind the Door of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What?! I-I couldn't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Uck...uckkk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hurry! He's too dangerous! His power of darkness has engulfed him to the point that he's lost all sanity!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The other knights won't be able to take him down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>B-but...if I do what you say, you'll also—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>With these wounds, I would be defeated by him anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If that were to happen, I'd be consumed by the darkness and transformed into a Black Knight. I'll probably turn my blade against you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Do you want me, the honorable captain of the Holy Guard's 4th Regiment, to meet that fate?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Kanon, this is truly your last trial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If you are a true Paladin, you should be able to discard your hesitation for the sake of bringing peace to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Do it! Kanon!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Is that...an order?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes. My final order for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Understood. Ouroboros, I'll sign the contract.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Very well. This contract of truth is now sealed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Agh...aaaargh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ack! Stop raging and calm yourself! Agh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Focus! Discard any thoughts of distractions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>B-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>To become a Paladin, you need both strength and the mental capacity to continue believing in justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Be ruthless for the sake of peace in Babel, Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yes...Captain. Hyaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That's it. That's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Uggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Don't worry, Zahar. I'm going with you. It's almost time. Uckkkaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Goodbye...Captain Cadanova.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm proud of you, Kanon. It's time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova, I promise I'll come and save you one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Heh... Well, I'll look forward to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Kanon, I hereby proclaim you a graduate of the final trial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>From now on, you will be an official Paladin. I give you my sword as a symbol of proof.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Your sword? Captain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Become strong, Kanon. Become the captain of the Holy Guard, and protect the peace in Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Create a world where everyone can live happily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Y-yes, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The path you take will become the history of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Captain! Captain Cadanova!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Fare...well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova, I'll become strong so I can come and save you one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I see. Envylia, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Yes. Like Captain Vettel, I don't think I need Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You'll waste all that talent you have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I understand now that there are those like Captain Vettel who are strong even without wielding Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I think it's the strength of the soul. I want to learn about that strength under Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I want to find a way to make everyone happy without Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Let's go, Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Yes, Captain Vettel♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Come on, admit it! You just want to be with Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Ahahaha! Was it that easy to tell? Nah, just kidding♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>But when you return to Envylia, you'll be able to fulfill your dream of protecting your kingdom as a knight. Do your best, Chloe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I will. Thanks! Kanon, as a Paladin, and for the sake of all Babel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Use your Alchemy to make everyone happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Yes! That's what I promised Captain Cadanova! I'll also do my best! Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Even though our paths will differ, we'll both be fighting for justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Doesn't that kind of make us like Captain Cadanova and Vettel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Come on. We're not that cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Ahaha! Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>See you, Kanon. Thanks for everything until now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>No, thank you! See you around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Hey, Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>From now on, we'll walk different paths, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>When you're in trouble...I'll protect you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Okay! That's a promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Yes, I promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Well then... I've got a promise to keep with Captain Cadanova as well. I'm gonna be busy!</td>
