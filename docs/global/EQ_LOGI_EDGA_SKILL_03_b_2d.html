<td>Huff...huff... Looks like it paid off. Hahah. Flat lines really can become three-dimensional!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Both a gunshot and a sword slash is a flat line, but, by intersecting them, we created a three-dimensional effect. For something we improvised, it worked pretty well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We can use it again in the future! We'll need a name for it! How about we call it Cluster Buster?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You've horrible at naming things.</td>

<td>Y-you...imbeciles! The Messiah...! The crystal of this country's evolution...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's a pretty fragile crystal. Breaks pretty easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's true that the Messiah was a well-made AI. It registered all the methods of human warfare and ways of conduct as data. Then, it used that data to evolve itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But haven't you realized? The people who created the Messiah and all the material the Messiah learned from...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>They were all humans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We, humans, have held our ground in the face of adversary over and over again. That's what makes us relevant. Machines are no match for us when it comes down to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's true that it'll be inconvenient for the people of this city if there aren't any machines, but it'll also mean they're free. If you can't enjoy freedom, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There's no point in being born human. It's idiotic for humans to try to live the life of a machine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...!</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Get up, you big imbecile. It wasn't energy that was sucked out of you, but the will the stand on your own two feet...and this has been going on for years now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>In this country that relies on machines, I thought I had trained all of you to at least think for yourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>When you said that you were gonna leave, I thought you were going to become independent, but it seems like I woefully misguided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Now get up! As long as you can stand on your own, I drag you with me where ever I go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Do-Don...! Sob...I-I was a real idiot. I'm...sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Heh. Well then, Mr. Unbalanced, now that I've rescued you, we're even!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh? What are you prattling on about? Did I ever ask the likes of you to rescue me? And who are you calling unbalanced?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>For starters, if it weren't for you I'd still have the energy in my right arm and I wouldn't have had to receive a beating from that pile of scrap!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What?! Is that how you speak to the man who saved your life?! Your mom isn't here to rescue you, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You comb head...I'll blow you away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>H-hey, what the...?! What are you trying to do me?! Let me...go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If you have time, then help out with the restoration of the city. You're partially to blame for its destruction, so you should fulfill your responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Do-don't speak nonsense! It's one thing to be told by Don, but why do I have to listen to the likes of—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>In that case, would you like to get involved in that situation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Maybe...we're also like bullets fired from a gun. Once we stop, all that's left for us to do is fall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Stop speaking nonsense, and stop those two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Just let them go at each other until they feel better. The same can be said for this country. Stagnation and fatigue caused it to fall as low as it could before it finally began working again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Those two will eventually begin working again too. They just have a little too much energy on their hands so that's their way of releasing it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>... ...</td>

<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Today is the day that we settle this!</td>
