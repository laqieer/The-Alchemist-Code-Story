<td>How is the investigation going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's been confirmed. The rumors of an invasion of Wadatsumi were true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So, Greed Dike is on the move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>In addition, though we have not verified this information, it is rumored that Gluttony Foss is supporting their warmongering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ceclidis may be up to something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sadly, we do not yet have the strength to oppose an entire nation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I cannot stand it... It is vexing that we can only stand idly by as lives are being taken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There is still something we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What would that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We can use the connections General Leordas left us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Though their numbers are waning, there is still an anti-Ceclidis movement in the South. I expect there are also numerous merchants losing their patience with the tyranny of the nobles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>With their cooperation, we could seize and control trade on the black market on a scale that would eclipse that of both the royal capital and the port city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Do you mean to obstruct support from Gluttony to Greed Dike? Would that not attract too much attention to us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We do not need to stop their support entirely. We only need to delay it as much as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It is not unusual for merchant caravans to encounter trouble on the road. I hear stories of former mercenaries becoming bandits and raiding caravans nearly every day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Must we really go that far?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If we do this right, we can delay war without shedding any blood. Why wouldn't we do this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>How are the arrangements?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We have explained our ruse to the caravans. We will plunder their goods while they are enroute to deliver them, but we will return those goods as they make their trip back home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>They have agreed to cooperate with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's just that...they must still be apprehensive of our intentions, because they have also hired a squad from the Royal Army as guards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This changes nothing. Keep casualties to a minimum as you take the goods. Be sure to keep up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hey! What's with this slow pace?! The harbor is just beyond this checkpoint!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We apologize, but our horses are worn out from the constant deliveries of ammo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Tch! Where is the glory in this? Why must we, of the Royal Army, participate in such lowly work as guarding merchants?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, I have here some fine wine from my secret stash... Perhaps this will lift your mood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well... No, I wish, but I am on duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Now, now, don't be so uptight! Here, just one cup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Uh, w-well... If you insist...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(The merchant gives a thumbs up to Kamui, with a somewhat self-satisfied smile.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Time to attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What theâ€”a raid?!</td>
