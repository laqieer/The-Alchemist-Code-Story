<td>It's been confirmed. The rumors of an invasion of Wadatsumi were true.</td>

<td>I cannot stand it... It is vexing that we can only stand idly by as lives are being taken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>There is still something we can do.</td>

<td>Though their numbers are waning, there is still an anti-Ceclidis movement in the South. I expect there are also numerous merchants losing their patience with the tyranny of the nobles.</td>

<td>With their cooperation, we could seize and control trade on the black market on a scale that would eclipse that of both the royal capital and the port city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hisham</td>
<td>Do you mean to obstruct support from Gluttony to Greed Dike? Would that not attract too much attention to us?</td>
</tr>

<td>We do not need to stop their support entirely. We only need to delay it as much as possible.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>It is not unusual for merchant caravans to encounter trouble on the road. I hear stories of former mercenaries becoming bandits and raiding caravans nearly every day.</td>

<td>Must we really go that far?</td>

<tr>

<td>We have explained our ruse to the caravans. We will plunder their goods while they are enroute to deliver them, but we will return those goods as they make their trip back home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fruit Peddler</td>
<td>They have agreed to cooperate with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fruit Peddler</td>
<td>It's just that...they must still be apprehensive of our intentions, because they have also hired a squad from the Royal Army as guards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>This changes nothing. Keep casualties to a minimum as you take the goods. Be sure to keep up!</td>
