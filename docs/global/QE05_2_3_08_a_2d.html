<td>Well done. It seems my faith in you was not misplaced. Despite being backed into a corner, you didn't give up. You chose to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It is no small thing to do so, to wake up every morning determined to carve your own space into the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>However, you have done more than survive. You have thrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It is good to see you again, Kamui, my last disciple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wh-what?! This cannot be real... Lord Waginau, you sacrificed yourself that day. For us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ah, yes. That day, so long ago, the person I was sacrificed his own life. Yet, to me, death has been little more than a short reprieve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>After I was given the Curse of Sin that day, my existence was carved into this world as a shadow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Not entirely unlike yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Have you not realized, Kamui? You died that day as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Are you serious? Look at him, he is clearly not dead. Are you sure you've got everything screwed on right? Are you drunk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A successor of the Sephira? Hm. Well, I have no use for you just now. Sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Carla!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This is not the time to be worrying about someone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Is this your idea of justice, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm asking you if hunting down the Sephira as the head of the Corpse, is the justice of the man who was once our Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You were the one who taught me that justice lies within one's own heart, and that the will to strictly discipline one's self, is the only way to restrain excessive power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yet, I look at you now...and not even traces of the man I once knew remain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Justice? Ha. Justice?! Kamui, compassion has blinded you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Heal, protect, save... How many times have you done that already? Haven't you realized that it's not enough to redeem the sickness of humanity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You've lost it. That's all I can assume from what you're saying. You've completely lost your marbles!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Don't you see, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No matter how much you pray, no matter how many you save, there will always be parts of the world that are shrouded in darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>When I taught you to be a Protector, what I showed you was only one face: Compassion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It is time that I finally reveal the shadows I hid from you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The other face of Waginau, the immortal Protector: Power!</td>
</tr>
