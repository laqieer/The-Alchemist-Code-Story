<td>Hmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Did we win? Did we...beat the Führer? Don't tell me he's a fake...just like my brother was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>He was really tough. Alphonse...it sounded like you knew him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>He's the supreme leader of Amestris, and also the ultimate warrior—no, homunculus—among our enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hmm. How peculiar that a homunculus formed of several beings should then be further transmuted into another world, like so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I think I almost would have preferred that my existence be completely erased, instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Perhaps it is this world, or the fault of the summoner...but my body feels sluggish and does not move as I expect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Are you serious?! Are you saying you'd be even stronger in your original body?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What a dull way to have to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Still, I am...pleased, in a way, to meet you again, Alphonse Elric.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You're...the real Wrath. How can you be here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I was called forth as a Phantom, the soul of one who has lost their body. I do not favor this form, but I do appreciate the unique strength it allows me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Once he understood the potential these forms have here, he immediately called for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>He...? No, it can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Pride! Or, Selim, as he is known within the Holy Order. He is rather well-regarded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It happened several decades ago, according to the timeline of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>During an experiment, the Holy Order accidentally transmuted a small Dimensional Gate that was connected to our world for just a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It was then that Pride entered this world for the first time and gained the power of this bodily form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Selim... I've heard that name. You can't mean...he's not from this world?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ah... So you are one of the sacrifices Selim prepared. The special child strengthened with homunculus powers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>How could you... How could Selim...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This pisses me off. You outsiders are the ones messing up our world?! You can't just treat us as disposable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Anger? That's good. Very good... That's a pure, righteous anger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>A...righteous anger?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Alphonse, when we were in Amestris, I was able to use my position to oppose you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I won't apologize for it. I do not even regret it. However, in this world, that option is not available to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>In this world, every person, king or peasant, must act on their own accord. I will admit...I find this more interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It seems that towers like this one have been built in the other countries as well. Will we go destroy those as well, Edgar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What do you think? As a person of this world... No. As a man, I can't forgive this cruel plan of the homunculi. How dare they take advantage of Toritoh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>There's no need to be concerned for me. However... Thank you for getting angry on my behalf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Vivi, Alphonse... I think I'll go with Edgar to take down all the towers. There's this feeling in my chest and I just... I feel like I need to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I think that's anger. It's normal to feel that in response to the realization that someone has been toying with your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's...kind of a relief to hear. Thank you, Alphonse, Edgar. I couldn't do this without you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Vivi, could you stay here and act as a liaison between us and Colonel Mustang? I trust you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Well! I feel very used! I suppose...if I must...I shall. Leave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The closest country is Envylia. Let's show the Holy Order what happens when you challenge the will of the people!</td>
