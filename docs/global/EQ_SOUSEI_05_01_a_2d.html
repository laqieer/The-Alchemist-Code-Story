<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>So you want me to betray this region. Me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Indeed, these lands are already beyond salvation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Of course, I understand that a knight such as yourself may have some apprehensions about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Please understand that I am not telling you to besmirch your honor—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm not worried about such things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I am simply afraid, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Afraid? A knight of such power and renown as yourself knows how to feel fear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Haha! I dedicated my life to training so I might someday become a knight like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But...this road is a hard and dangerous one to walk alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I see what might await me at the end of the road, but I do not know if I have the resolve to carry my feet to meet it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But there is no need to fear. After all, you are not alone on your path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No matter the trials and hardships that cut them down, humans always find a way to get back up again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>King Arius...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Keep those words close to heart, Andechs, most prestigious knight of these lands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Keep walking this path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>As long as you do not stray, you shall never be alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>――――</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sin, sin, sin—yes, that is the crime these humans carry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>All this sin and corruption has grown rampant while I laid idle... Haha, it's funny to think I myself might've succumbed to sloth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Now, where do I start...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Lust. Sloth. Gluttony. I shall deal with those places first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Unfortunately, what I can do is limited. Temporary measures, at best. After all, time waits for no one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What will you do? How will you face your doom as you stand on the brink of destruction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Princess... Why?! Why should you have to clean up after their mess?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...Zafeiris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If the humans wish to slay the beasts, the pillars of this world, then they only have themselves to blame when their world starts breaking at the seams!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If that place were to be banished from the Cosmic Egg, just like the Avaritia Belt—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Silence, fool! There's nothing worse than a sore loser who doesn't know when to give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You, slain by human hands, have already lost the form that connected you to these lands, and with that, any qualification to choose the fate of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I have already decided they are the ones who shall carry forward the next generation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'll be their shepherd and guide, the one that leads them into a new world. It'll be alright to help them a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...You'll help them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If we want a world where humanity can prosper, it's a foregone conclusion, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hah... Finally, there's an end to this meaningless, worthless existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...Princess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>This world is already at its end. All that's left is to see whether or not they will find the future they are longing for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Meanwhile, we ought to quietly accept our fate. We're little more than ghosts of the past, there is no reason for us to linger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's blue...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>This endless ocean, these skies covered in silvery clouds. And somehow... A yearning exists within me. I cannot find peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What am I here for? I don't understand. I'm not good enough. Not strong enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This shield was too heavy for me, so I thought I simply had to keep training till it felt like an extension of myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>So why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Why, why, why? I can think of nothing else. Why? Why am I still not—? I sit and wait for dusk to swallow me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Lady Daphne! We've finished inspecting the cargo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We got lucky, the storm barely left a scratch. We didn't lose much at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That's a relief. Please let the captain know we can resume our voyage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>This cargo is irreplaceable to the royal capital of Sodom. We must continue to do our utmost to ensure its safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yes, ma'am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Haah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Oh my, did you let a sigh slip there? That won't do. You shouldn't keep all your worries to yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ah, forgive me! I lost track of myself! How embarrassing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Oh, don't mind me! I'm not scolding you or anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>But you looked so worried, so I couldn't help but say something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>No, no, my lady, this is just how my face always looks, but I appreciate the concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Is that so? Oh dear, don't tell me I'm bothering you with my chatter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Ah, not at all! It's just that I've never had the chance to talk with a noblewoman such as yourself before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Does status bother you? You shouldn't worry about where or to whom someone was born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Relax, and please call me Nicaea. That's what my father and Imnus call me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I-I couldn't! If I dared to call a princess by her first name, it'd be off with my head!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Oh, don't be silly. What kind of king would behead his knights over such a minor thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You understand, right, Daphne?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Y-yes, my lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You hold a proud and noble position in our army. The one and only Shield Maiden who commands the shield regimen of the Purple Flame Knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>In fact, I'd argue you have more right to pride than someone like me, whose only good quality is her birthright.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>My lady, please, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Bwrzz! Bweep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Look, Selsieg agrees with me, too! So be a bit more confident already, and just call me Nicaea! No more of this 'my lady' or 'Your Highness' nonsense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I-I can't! Please forgive me, but I must at least insist on Lady Nicaea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I see... What a shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Ah well, at least I got you to let down your guard and relax for a moment here. I will take the little victories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>My lady...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I understand why you're so concerned. Our lands are surrounded by the ocean on all sides, so maritime trade is of vital importance to our citizens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>But you wouldn't be assigned such an important escort duty if they didn't think you were able to do it. That means everybody recognizes your abilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You're not just protecting cargo! Think of the smiles and happiness of the citizens all over our country. I know you can do it if you just think of it that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>When you put it that way... Yes, I love this place and its people. I want everyone who lives here to be able to laugh their days away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Then I ask you to relax a little. We all know you can do it, so there's no need to be so tense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Bwreep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>See, Selsieg believes in you too. So please, be a little more confident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Y-yes, my lady...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>(Nicaea's smile is so bright and gentle, I don't doubt her sincerity, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...This is how I always feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Huh? Did you say something? I didn't catch it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Ah, it's nothing! Nothing at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but I really should return to my duties. Let us continue this conversation some other time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Ah, of course. I'm dreadfully sorry, once I start chattering away I find it hard to stop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Imnus is always scolding me for such things too. "A real lady should have some more discretion" and so on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>The captain said that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Yes, he's always telling me I should mind my reputation more if I am going to be his wife... Ah, sorry, here I go again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>You just told me you had to get back to work, and here I am, holding you up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Please don't look so glum, my lady! If people noticed you looking so downcast by my side, it'd be my reputation getting dragged through the mud—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>BWIRR BWRI!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Huh? Selsieg, is something wro—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Lady Nicaea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Gggraah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Stand back, my lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>This is an emergency! Shield regimen, formations! We're dealing with the Leviathan's leftovers here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Yes, ma'am! We're ready to fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Send a messenger to the sailors that we've got to get out of here immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Daphne, I could...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Don't worry about a thing, my lady. We can handle this, so you and Selsieg should get to a safe place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>GRAGH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>We might not need to fight the real thing! As long as we get rid of the ones on the ship, we can still escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Get back where you came from!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>...Tsk. This just got messy.</td>
</tr>
