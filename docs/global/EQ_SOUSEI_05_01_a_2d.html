<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nica.png" alt="Nicaea" height="128"><br>Nicaea</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nica.png" alt="Nicaea" height="128"><br>Nicaea</td>
<td>You're not just protecting cargo! Think of the smiles and happiness of the citizens all over our country. I know you can do it if you just think of it that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/daph.png" alt="Daphne" height="128"><br>Daphne</td>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
