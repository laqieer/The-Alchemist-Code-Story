</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...This is clearly my fault. Because I didn’t listen to you and chased after them on my own...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You were right that we needed to call for reinforcements. We should have left while things were calm. I’m truly sorry... This is all my fault!</td>

<td>That’s right... I can fire my gun to that song...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I fired a shot once and it was a mistake. But this time it would’ve been a mistake not to shoot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I won’t run away anymore! I will never let you die!</td>
