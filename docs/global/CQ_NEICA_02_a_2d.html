<td>Phew... I can finally breathe again. Running isn't my forte.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Then we should get going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Mmmm, but... Maybe it's best if I just go home. There are always so many people at festivals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Those suspicious men from before might be there, and I really don't want to deal with scouts. They're always so persistent. Staying at home is much more...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hey, I know! Why don't you come over my place? I have everything ready for a cozy night in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Letting little things like that stop you from going out is so boring!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Y-you're absolutely right! Hahahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(Ungh... She has a point.)</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(She came all the way here from Wadatsumi. I guess I can't blame her for not wanting to stay cooped up indoors.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Come on! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>W-wait! Fujika!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Here we are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Welcome, one and all! Come, have a look at these accessories—hand-made by the powerful Alchemia Mage herself, Miss Neica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>These are incredibly rare pieces, normally available only by custom order! If you want to get your hands on one, you must buy it here, today, at my stall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wow! She made these?! Oh my gosh! I need one! Gimme!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Me too! Gimme!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Th-this is...the stall selling my accessories!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Heheheh. You told me about it in one of your letters. Don't you remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I-I guess I did. It's the first time I've gotten to sell my accessories like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This is amazing! So many people came here to buy your accessories, Neica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I feel so happy that my friend's work is so popular! That's so cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's...just because of my powers, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What do you mean, Neica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Everyone thinks that my accessories have Alchemia in them, and will grant them some kind of special power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I've never actually tried to do that. It's not something I want to do, either, but everyone keeps hoping for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I was happy when the stall owner asked me if I wanted to sell them, but at the end of the day, even that was just because of my powers, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Even though I never wanted them in the first place...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Neica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Found ya, Fujika!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Y-you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ain't that the powerful Alchemia Mage, Neica, with ya? Even better, I'll take both of ya with me. I'm gonna need to borrow your powers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Nnngghh! This is why I don't like going outside! It's too dangerous!</td>
