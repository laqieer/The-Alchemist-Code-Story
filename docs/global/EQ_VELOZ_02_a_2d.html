<td>Wow, this is bad. It's been extensively destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey...incredible. Weren't these parts made during the age of ancient Alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There's hardly any wear. It almost looks new.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ack. It's a tragic waste for such a brilliant device to be destroyed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What do you think? Does it look like you can fix it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmm. Well, it was destroyed pretty violently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I don't mind if the structure changes slightly. Can you do something about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm worried about working on such a beautiful masterpiece like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If it were up to me, I would remove the bell and save it as material.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Come on, Veloz...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This masterpiece is packed with not only Alchemy but a lot of technology that has been lost in an ancient era.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>To repair it to its previous condition will be impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This bell is a symbol of Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>In the center of this city, it always watches over everyone's happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This bell symbolizes peace itself. We cannot remove it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You know the tradition of ringing the bell on a wedding day, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This bell imparts happiness to people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If it is no longer there, it'll make everyone sad. Veloz...I'm sure that woman you cherished would've felt the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>However...when it comes to Alchemy skill, I doubt it's easy to handle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...There's one thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If you just want to ring the bell, there is a way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>How...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>To make equipment of this size move, the power used in mage engineering is not enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But if you can use a Philosopher's Stone...you might be able to move it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>A Philosopher's Stone...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yep. Alchemia bikes these days almost all run on the power of mage engineering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But the earliest model was different. It used a Philosopher's Stone as power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ah, the Excelsior Generator used in Gunner Caris's motorbike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm very impressed you knew that, Mayor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Caris was an outrageous woman who came up with the idea of using a Philosopher's Stone as a way to fuel the engine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But...without her imagination, Slothstein's industrialization may never have occurred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>True...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That being said, how are we supposed to recreate something from such an old era?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>A blueprint?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This is the blueprint for the engine that is gathering dust in the back of my house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Wasn't your house...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes. It got caught up in the war and was burnt down without a trace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Somehow the house's warehouse alone remained intact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>There I found this map. This blueprint was apparently written by my grandpa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>This is Caris's signature! In other words, this engine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes. The first Excelsior Generator ever made by humanity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>If we use this blueprint as a reference, we may be able to manage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I had no idea you were connected with the founder of the Alchemia motorbike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Will it be possible to recreate it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>There's just one problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>We don't have any Philosopher's Stone to use. To gain enough power, we need one with a decent amount of purity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>A Philosopher's Stone, huh? I understand. Let me do something about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What do you mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I have one possible option. Leave that to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well, well, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>A Philosopher's Stone? Is he referring to Belphegor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I don't know. But Edward said he would procure it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hmph. In other words, very soon it will be handed to this engineer Veloz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Most likely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Assess the situation, send out the dogs, and do not get distracted by Edward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>So this is a Philosopher's Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I can't believe that Slothstein used to be a city for mining these from the sea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I never thought I would actually see one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>This Philosopher's Stone was kept safe as a historical document.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>This is a symbol of peace, so to speak. It symbolizes Slothstein. It makes sense to use it for the bell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You sure you're okay entrusting me with something so important?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Well, anyway, I'll try my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>All right, now I just need to connect this base...and it's complete!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Phew... Now I just need to have the mayor come and pick it up as soon as tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Whoa! What theâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Huh?! What is this thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Agh! Th-the Philosopher's Stone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Wa-wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Give it back, you metal dog! That's important!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Jeez.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What is it now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>He asks me to come and look what I find...Real Heaven has now been officially downgraded to a scrap metal zoo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>D-Don Taras?! What are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Stop mucking about and follow me...that is if you want to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
