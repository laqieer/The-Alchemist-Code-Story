<td>Kagura, I'm glad to see you've returned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>When I was coming this way, I heard some talk. Is it true that the Mikaboshi was found in Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Unfortunately, it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I see. I didn't think it was real. I thought it was a fairytale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>â€˜The Mikaboshi filled with fierce Chakras<br>wielding power, what shapes reality<br>whisking our warrior where we won't follow...'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So you've heard about that legend surrounding Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes. I was surprised when I researched it. It almost seems to depict a Sacred Stone opening the Door of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's a silly story. It's hard to imagine such a dangerous power lying dormant within Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>However, according to the report from our investigative unit, the Alchemia contained with the discovered Mikaboshi is equivalent to that of a Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The authenticity of such legends aside, the fact is the Mikaboshi exists and is as powerful as a Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If such a power were to fall into the hands of evil, who knows what will happen to the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You're going to destroy it immediately, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes. For that reason, I had you hurry back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What do you mean? Will I be moving separately from everyone else? Is this some kind of special mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, you're sort of half right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Lord Zain?! Why are you unsheathing your sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What? A monster?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wh-what is going on?! Did you bring in these monsters, Lord Zain?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
