<td>The twins Mikaboshi and Sumeragi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's hard to believe the Sacred Three of Wadatsumi have such an incredible origin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My first task, it seems, is to retrieve the Mikaboshi. Err, the stone, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's a lot easier said than done. The Mikaboshi is currently in the hands of Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Did I hear someone mention the name of my homeland?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oho, it's just you, then? That must mean the Hidden Ogres were successfully dispensed with. And the base is still intact, to boot! Well done. Well done indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>How do you know about the Hidden Ogres?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I received news from Captain Ugachi outside. Is something amiss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>N-no, everything's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What happened with Celis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Amane!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I understand Celis went to meet with you. So, what happened to her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh? I had no idea Celis had come to meet with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>In that case, why are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'd heard the Blade Fox were taking a bit of a beating, and came to provide aid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But why now? You've never come directly to Wadatsumi before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Why now, you ask? An excellent question, I must say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We of Greed Dike have conducted extensive research over the span of many eras. And the laborious results of those experiments...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ghk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...have finally borne fruit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Injected not just with blood but with modified genetic material, and enhanced with pure corruption, the very body of the recipient will metamorphose in defiance of all natural law.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>By studying that undead state, a means of replicating and thus mass-producing it was to inevitably take shape. And at that point, it was no stretch to regard such beings as living weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I present to you the culmination of this project. I call these beings...Dismortants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What in the world...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Now, show me your despair!</td>
