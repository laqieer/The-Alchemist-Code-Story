<td>Heheh, it's finally here! This is our season! Right, Yuki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yeah! Since we risked our lives to tell them and everything, I'm sure they're doing things right this year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You betcha! I just know that the snowmen they decorate are going to be adorable this time 'round!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We'll give our thanks to the snow spirits, then wait up with bated breath for the real Santa Claus to appear. Yup, there's no doubt about it! This is gonna be a real Winter Holiday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't forget that we have to see if—you know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You're right. We sure have a lot to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I really hope those guys don't show up again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hey, don't say scary things like that! I couldn't handle it if they suddenly started shooting at us and chasing us around again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I know! Let's watch over this Winter Holiday from behind the scenes, all sneaky-like! That way, we'll have nothing to worry about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, really now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ahhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Sneaking around in a place like this... I guess that makes you two the culprits, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Unnnnggghhhh! Don't shoot! W-we haven't even done anything yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yet...? Wait, are you saying this wasn't your doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wh-what are you even talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why don't you take a look around? You have eyes, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>There's no snow, not a single drop—and that means no snowmen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>W-well, now that you mention it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There really isn't any snow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This has never happened before. The children always look forward to building snowmen every Winter Holiday, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I thought it was strange, and just as I started investigating, I came across the two of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I was convinced that you had decided to call off the Winter Holiday over something petty, like the snowmen not being cute enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>How dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You should listen to what people have to say before you start pointing guns at them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hazel! I brought them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You can't have a Winter Holiday without snow! If the snow won't fall on its own, then it's up to us to make it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's what these two are here for! Birgitta the Soothsayer and Klima the weather-changer, you're up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>My goodness! What a slave-driver you are, Carol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You want me to make it snow, right? I'll do my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Thanks so much, you two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Okay, here I go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What is it, Klima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Something's not right. It's just not working!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmmm, let me see... Ah, yes. Allow me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hmph. My prayers aren't working, either, which means that something must be getting in the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I knew it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Eek! I'm telling you, it's not us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ahhhhh! M-monsters?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wh-what are they doing here?! Oh, no! They're coming this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hmph. I suppose they were driven here by the Alchemia we stirred up with our powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well, here they come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Urrrrggggrrrrraaagggghhh!</td>
