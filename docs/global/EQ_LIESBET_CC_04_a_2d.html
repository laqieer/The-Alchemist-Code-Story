<td>Whoa, a little late, but I just realized how cold it is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ohh...Well, it's a given since we were playing on the ice for so long. Plus, there are a lot of trees around here so it makes it colder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This is where Liz comes in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh? Eeeek?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Heheheh! Your baby-like skin is warm! Ah, such bliss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He-hey! You're cold! And stop acting like I'm younger than you! Eeek...you're so cooold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(I wonder if Liz is warm...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You know how you should snuggle up together if you get lost in the mountains? Here, Rebecca, come closer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well, it makes sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Rebecca?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Not...so...tight...! Oh...but I'm feeling warmer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>More importantly, what're we gonna do from here? We've progressed so far in cloudy weather, but there are no flowers blooming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmm. I think it'll be fine. See. At least they have signs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, you're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This sign looks a little old, but it means that people have come here, and we might actually be pretty close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're an optimist as ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Um..."Look into the ice. The reflection shows those beyond flesh and blood who think of you."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>"If you love the ones reflected in return, you will find a token of your love ahead. If not, you cannot proceed."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This has come out of the blue. The ones before this were completely different. This one's like the kind that appears at the final location of a tourist spot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hmm. In other words, this ice is a mirror to show how both of you feel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No way?! If that's true, that's amazing! I wanna take each and every one of our classmates here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's a scary thought...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wh-wh-what should I do?! I-it's going to show the person I like!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hey, Liz? Just putting this out there, but...um...you wouldn't happen toâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Did you think I didn't know about it? It's that Holy Guard, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Whaaaat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>In other words, if Dias appears then this ice is real! Come on, Liz, look into it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Whaaa! I'm the test subject?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm looking from the side angle, so I can only see the two of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm the same. I can only see the two of you. What about you...Liz? What do you see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...! Oh no...! What should I do?! I don't see Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ah, I knew it was just ice. No way there'd be magic here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I-I can also only see the two of you as well. Oh dear... What are we gonna do about it? I don't think we can get the Stub Rule...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Liz, isn't this weird? You're standing directly on top of the ice, right? Where's your reflection?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huh...what?! A-am I not appearing?! What's this! Am I dead?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Calm down, Liz. But it's strange...why doesn't the person looking see their own reflection? Wait...could this be real?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Could we be the people that Liz loves and could Liz be who we love too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I-it's true that it doesn't necessarily say someone of the opposite sex...and maybe it includes friendship as love?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ah...you're probably right! Oh...but that's a little sad...Dias...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well, you just met him and you can never be too sure with love at first sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You can take your time and slowly deepen your feelings towards each other, right? Like you did with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Rebecca...! Thanks...both of you for always thinking of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Well, we are best friends, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>A-and I'm the class chairperson, so it's natural for me to have my classmates on my mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>As coy as always. But I guess we cleared the test, didn't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I think it's all right! My feelings for both of you are real as well! I think it's okay! I think we can get there!</td>
