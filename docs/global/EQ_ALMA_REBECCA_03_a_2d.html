<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Well?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Now that Asmodeus is gone, my body feels so much heavier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This is your chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's what she calls being slow and heavy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ngh... One more time, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>All right, come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(I can't believe Alma is practicing so seriously... She really does want to become a reporter, doesn't she?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hm...? What? I'm on break right now, if you have something to s... What? A UFO? At 10 o'clock?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wait... Who's there? Identify yourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Now's my chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ngh... You brat, Alma! Where did you learn ventriloquial magic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Heheheh. That worked perfectly! You're such a work-a-holic, I knew you'd fall for it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ugh! What a childish method.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Heheh. What a cute voice you let out just now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I-I did not! Forget you ever heard it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If you don't, then I'll make sure to erase your memory with one strike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I-I already forgot! M-master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Heh... Joking aside, a promise is a promise. A surprise attack is also a praiseworthy tactic. Since you landed a hit, I'll tell you what I said I would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I-I didn't do anything, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>She promised me. If I landed a blow on her, then she would tell me a very special tale!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That was more than enough to hook me, Alma, the embodiment of curiosity!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's the reason you've been working so hard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's a story from two centuries ago. Rebecca, it has to do with what you asked before, too. It's a story of my master and your grandmother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>About Grandmother...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>How exciting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This country was originally a settlement where magic users could gather.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Now, because of the curse of Asmodeus, most have disappeared, but long ago, there were a lot of men who could use magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I have seen records of male witches...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Since everyone was on equal magical footing, the men obviously had the advantage due to their stronger builds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Because of that, the balance of power in Lustburg used to be the opposite of what it is now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>When I was young, the witch population was decreasing. The reason is explained in a folk song you've heard, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If a witch falls in love, her magic falls with her...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's the one. In those days, when a witch became intertwined with the opposite sex, she would start losing her magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It was most likely being passed on to her unborn child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Due to that, the witch population was dropping and our standing in society was weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>However, in any era, there will always be prodigies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>With a merciless iron fist, one woman beat all of the men in her way until she alone held the throne. She was the strongest witch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That witch...was my master. As a master of both spell casting and martial arts, she was a true force to be reckoned with... Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Melvy?! What's the matter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wait...are you pregnant?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If I was, I wouldn't be darting all over the sky and sparring with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's nothing like that. It's just...whenever I remember training with my master, I feel a bit sick. I'm fine now, so let's continue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Your master was that terrifying? Was she really human?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>She was a terrifying witch, but she was also a kind person. She was like a mother to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>All of the citizens adored her...but not for long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>She was still a woman, and during her reign as queen, she fell in love with a foreign man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>For her to continue to rule, a great amount of magical power was required, but my master chose being a wife over being a queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I personally felt that she should be free to do so. However, there was a problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>A problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The woman who bore Venus, known as Mother, possessed Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>She was a greedy witch who wanted to be intertwined with a man yet not lose her magical powers, and, unfortunately, Asmodeus granted her wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The curse was the result of that wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That's how all of this started. The men became bugs and the women started using the men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Furthermore, the man Mother fell for...was my master's husband.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Mother had magic that could manipulate men, so she stole him away with minimal effort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>At that time, people with last names were rare in Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Thus, witches who married would take their husband's names.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Mother was no exception. She took the name of the husband she stole from my master and passed it on to her daughter, Venus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Now that you mention it... Her Majesty did say that she changed her last name. What was her original name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The name that she got from her parents was Venus Haas Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Wait, but... Haas is... That's Alma's surname.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Yeah, well, you see there are two Haas families in this country. There's mine...and there's the queen's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You already knew? It's the most fiercely kept secret in this country!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It's 'cause I knew that my ancestor was queen once, so I did my own research, thinking it might be something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>My mom was already pretty old when she got married.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>She died when I was 8, so I never really got to ask her anything about our history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You have royal blood?! Wait, your mom died when you were 8?! Alma, how have you been surviving all this time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Well, isn't it obvious? To live, I sold the one thing a woman can sell repeatedly that never runs out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You...can't possibly mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That's right: information! No matter how much you sell, it never runs out! So you can sell as much as you need!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Finding it out on my own is free, so that's why I love gossip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I-information?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Hmmmm? Rebecca? What did you think I meant?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>N-nothing! A-anyway, Melvy, so...you knew Alma's ancestors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What does that have to do with my grandmother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The curse of Asmodeus was already spreading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>As the land fell into chaos, Mother was executed, and Venus was also pursued.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I ran away with Venus, but while we were on the run, we began to realize that it was no way to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Inside of Venus slept the power of Asmodeus that was passed on to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Her power was feared, so I thought that perhaps if she used her abilities to calm the chaos, her image would also improve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>That means...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>That's the same way I felt about Liz's power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>That's right. Rebecca, your grandmother was part of that plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>She was?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>When my master held the throne, the Helkovara family worked for her. Your grandmother, in particular, adored her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>My master wanted to bring the unrest to a close as soon as possible so that children could be brought up safely again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>The three of us, your grandmother included, worked together to take Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>We swore to bring the chaotic time to an end, but it didn't work out that way. Your grandmother tried to kill Venus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>The head of the Helkovara family at that time believed that Venus was the one who stole their beloved leader's power, so they embraced the chaos and decided to use it to take back control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>They didn't want us to take Asmodeus and they feared Venus' power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>So the head of the Helkovara family tasked your grandmother with killing Venus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>She was opposed, but eventually she caved under the pressure from her family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>She couldn't break free of the control that the family held over its members.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I never intended to blame her, but we argued and decided to part ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Even so, I was sure that Venus and I alone would be capable of retaking Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>However, Venus fell into despair after being betrayed by her dear friend. From then on, she was different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I wanted her to believe that her power wasn't evil, and that Asmodeus was not inherently bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>The curse of Asmodeus, which resulted in her existence, was a necessary price this country had to pay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I wanted to help her believe that. I guess...I wanted to believe it myself, too. In any case, she...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Venus united this country through power and fear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>She overthrew my master and made Lustburg the place it is now. But...she has suffered for it all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Rebecca, that's probably why she's taken you under her wing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>She regrets not being able to reconcile with your grandmother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>She's keeping you by her side as atonement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Me training you is kind of the same thing, Alma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>You're a memento of my master, so to speak. It's only natural to want to make you shine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Although, the main reason I'm training you is for Lisbeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Liz...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>She's like a miracle child. Just watching her is enough to restore one's faith in humanity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Now you've made it to the sky just as she did. You've succeeded in doing what we attempted to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>During that savage time, we gave up our belief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>We couldn't stop the Helkovara family's dash for power, nor the Haas family from being pushed out and impoverished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I'm so sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>What? No, but... You don't have to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Th-that's right! It's nothing you have to apologize for, Melvy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>We all live out our lives, unaware that we are creating history through our actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Regardless, we are responsible for the twisted era that was born of those actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I don't want to be one of those adults who can't bow their heads and admit fault when they've done wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>The Lustburg that we built was like ice; cold, hard, and distorted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>You guys... You melted that ice. You restarted the time that we caused to stop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>It's time to pass the controls over to you all and let you bring us home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Melvy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>So...I want you to throw everything you have at me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>It was a long story, but ultimately, no amount of time or explanation could convey to you all that has accumulated on our watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I suppose it can't be helped if it seems like we're useless old fogeys dumping all of the problems we couldn't solve onto your shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Even so...I hope that I can carve our 200 years of experience into you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>So that you can better the next 200 years—no, more... So that you can better the ongoing future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Yes, ma'am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Next time, I'll land a hit fair and square, without any sneak attack!</td>
</tr>
