<td>Bud</td>
<td>It's so hot... I'm sweating buckets! How can you stand it? I feel like my insides are boiling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>A common sentiment from those unused to the desert. Fear not, we are almost at our destination. Allow me to take this opportunity to thank you for your assistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>W-wow... That actually sounded sincere. I've gotta admit, I didn't expect that from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>You subdued our assailants, allowing my business to be conducted smoothly. I have much to be thankful for, and I am not ashamed to admit it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>O-oh, uh... You're welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>Nothing. I was just thinking that we've met fewer bandits than I expected. Odd...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Well, anyway... I've got something I wanted to ask you. When you gave the Blue Flames those orders, they ended up apprehending some thieves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>That's why you had them patrolling where you did, right? But how'd you know something like that was going to happen there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>You're asking me this now? Hmph. I'd love to ignore you, but I suppose you'd just pester me until I told you anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>Well, these assaults on our caravan began around the time that people started catching wind of our upcoming business deal—the one that we have just now set in motion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Right. That's the reason you wanted us for this escort mission to begin with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>It was obviously no coincidence. I knew that my enemy must be someone who stood to gain from interfering with the deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>Then, when we were attacked at the border, something about our assailants' weapons niggled at me. I knew I had seen them before, and I needed to know where.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>It was thanks to your opportune arrival that I was able to find out which guild had supplied the bandits with their weapons much faster than I might have otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>As such, I was able to anticipate that they would attempt to separate me from your protection before the deal took place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>So you figured they might try a diversion... That's why you sent the Blue Flames out, pretending I gave the orders. You were preemptively trying to keep people safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>Of course, it was wrong of me to give your knights orders in your stead. I apologize for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Haha... Y'know, you're pretty incredible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>I'm sorry for misunderstanding...and for misjudging you. I take back what I said about you making your subordinates do everything for you, and not being fit to lead them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>These past few days I've spent guarding you and your guild, I've come to appreciate how much attention you pay to everything going on around you, and how good you are at drawing on your comrades' strengths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>It's because your guild members know that you've got their backs—that you're going to protect your territory, no matter what—that they can trust in your orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Seeing that helped me realize what you meant about how leaders are meant to fight, and how I could be using my position to lead them better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>Ugh. You're making my skin crawl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Hey! I'm being serious, here! Anyway, long story short, you inspired me, so I decided to take a leaf out of your book. You'll see what I mean in a minute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/b_flame_knt.png" alt="Blue Flame Knight" height="128"><br>Blue Flame Knight</td>
<td>Reporting, captain! We have apprehended the group of bandits operating under the employ of the merchant guild according to your instructions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Good work! Thanks for that. Guess that means our mission here is done and dusted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>What was that all about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Like I said, I took a leaf out of your book! While you were busy making deals these past few days, I started giving your way of doing things a try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>I've been getting my knights to write me reports, and giving out extra instructions as needed after I read them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Doing that helped me get a handle on the big picture, and figure out where those bandits who attacked us at the border were based. Then I had my knights arrest them. Problem solved!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Well, almost. I figured there must be a few who slipped through our fingers, so I had my Blue Flame knights keep watch on the Desert Wings until they made it back safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>You say that like it was nothing, but the Blue Flame Guard are supposed to be knights of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>Not only that, but the Blue Flame Guard is supposed to be responsible for protecting the king himself. Was it really wise to deploy them so far away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Well, to be honest, this kind of mission is normally handled by the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>But having the Blue Flame Guard escort guests from a foreign nation made it clearer that we were rolling out the welcome mat, and I wanted to expand the mission experience of my knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Considering we were going to be guarding the Desert Wings, I had Nefertiti work things out with the king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>But this was a lot of work! Keeping watch by day, writing reports through the night... I've barely slept a wink since this mission started! Is this what you have to deal with on a daily basis, Ryle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>Hmph... Even Nefertiti was involved in this? I see. Well, you've done surprisingly well with what you learned from me... Although I can't help but suspect that some of it was sheer luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Aw... You're not impressed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>It shouldn't matter what I think. If your knights are satisfied with your command, why shouldn't you be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>If your new style of leadership has led to such a fruitful result as this, then I'd say you're doing well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>(His passion makes those around him want to support him. A valuable trait in a leader... One I lack myself.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Hey, Ryle? I couldn't have rounded up all those bandits without your help. So, thanks. You helped me protect Envylia, as well as the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>And... I feel like you've shown me something that's going to help me protect all of Babel. It's like this mission has brought me one step closer to realizing that dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>You really need to stop thanking me. I haven't done anything except protect what's mine. If you learned something from that, that was your own doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>If you are still determined to protect the entire continent, then be my guest. The added safety can only benefit my new trade route.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>You can count on that! I'm going to use what you taught me to do something meaningful. You'll see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Because I'm not going to try and do everything myself anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>I'm going to work with the knights of the Blue Flame Guard to become a captain capable of protecting the entire continent of Babel!</td>
