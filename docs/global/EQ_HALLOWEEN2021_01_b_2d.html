<td>001</td>
<td>Looks like we were able to recover some of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>They've taken more than half of the costumes…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Grr… How could this happen while I was in charge?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But why would they do such a thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No idea. They've stolen candy before, but Melda took care of that incident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Whatever the reason, without costumes, the parade…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You mean the parade might be cancelled?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh no… What'll we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Eeek!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh… so sorry… I shriek when I get irritated…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Um…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm embarassed by the habit. But I've always wanted to become a strong hero…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And I thought by dressing as one for the parade, I could imagine being one even for a short while…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Poor thing…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(Wanting to change his habit… Wanting to be of help for others… I know how he feels.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I...promise to get them back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>W-what's gotten into you, Cordelia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Once the costumes are recovered, the parade won't be cancelled, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So… I'll find those Rattys and make sure to get the costumes back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Helping someone, protecting someone, and getting involved scares me… but…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well said!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Replacing the costumes would be difficult, but recovering the stolen ones is a hopeful choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But our task is for the preparation and security. We can't spare any more manpower to go after them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Two is the maximum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'll go. Then I won't have to be around a lot of other people…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Alright. Blanchett and I will stay here to secure the area. The plan is set!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(Tethys...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If… If you two are going, please take this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This is…medicine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Medicine to make you communicate with Rattys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Rattys seem to be interested in Halloween…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So Rosa made this in hopes of communicating with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Rattys have a reason for their actions. They're not malicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If you want to know what they're thinking, you need to know what they're saying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I don't think there was malice to today's incident. Please don't be harsh with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I understand. There may be a reason for all this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But why would they steal if they just wanted to join us?</td>
</tr>
