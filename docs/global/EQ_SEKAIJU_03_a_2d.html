<td>Hey, there are a lot of monsters over there!</td>

<td>Oh man, this is giving me an eerie feeling.</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>Look, there's something weird about that tree in the center of the monsters!</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What is that?!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Uuhh... I don't feel like getting too close to that.</td>

<td>That's a Philosopher's Stone. Or rather, it's a former Philosopher's Stone that turned out this way due to an excessive negative energy.</td>

<td>A Philosopher's Stone?</td>

<td>A certain alchemist used this stone with the ambition of ruling the continent of Babel, or rather, the whole world.</td>

<td>Oh boy...</td>

<td>However, the stone is still running rampant with energy of his ambitions, and this ended up creating a link to another world.</td>
