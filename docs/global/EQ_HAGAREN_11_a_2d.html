<td>Oh, look! Look! The ocean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh... This is my first time seeing it with my own eyes. It's so...blue. It's beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But we don't have time to appreciate the view. Mei Fang, we must strike qui...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I heard from Vivi that you have come to embrace this more dangerous path. Such youthful foolishness. It's...cute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Still, stay calm. Roy and Riza have yet to give the signal. Rushing in will only result in failure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>As a transmuted Phantom, I understand the urge for haste, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's not for a Phantom like yourself to... Ugh... Ohhh. I just had something like a...dizzy spell...just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What was that? Are you okay? Do you feel sick?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No, I'm fine. Thank you, Alphonse. You're a sweet kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm someone who stands in opposition to your home—to your world. Well...not just to yours, but to this one as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You should forget about me, and focus on getting yourselves home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>General... Now you're just being small-minded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Edgar? What are you talking about? Did I say something wrong again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You've now been all over this world and met so many different people... Weren't they all good people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Don't you see? Only the Holy Order stands in opposition to you. The rest of Babel stands with you. We're your people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ah, youth... Toritoh, do not forget that Vivi and I are also your allies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Same here! And the rest of the gang from Amestris too! If you came to our world, Ed and I would welcome you with open arms!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The ocean seems calm...but a whirlpool could appear and disrupt it at any moment. Emotions...are no different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Thank you, everyone—really. I always thought my soul existed for the purpose of being sacrificed, and then disappearing forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It never occurred to me that there might be more to life than that. If I have people like you waiting for me, then there's still a reason to live, and to return home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, then. It looks like they're ready to go. I hope that homunculus, Greed, is ready for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Go forth! Complete your mission! When you're finished, we shall be waiting for you.</td>
