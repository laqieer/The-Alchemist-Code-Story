<td>To eradicate war, all seedlings of conflict must be snuffed out before they have a chance to bloom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This experimental use of human blood to create a mock Philosopher's Stone is abominable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>And yet, as incorrigible as those who conduct such experiments are, there is no shortage of parties to seek and fund this work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It has always been these simple whims that spawn conflict, which inevitably blossoms into war. No one can escape the cycle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Now, now. When your heart is singed by flames beyond your control, just take a moment to stop...and smell the flowers. Nothing cools a scorched heart faster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You're right, of course. I do tend to succumb to my anger, don't I? It's just that in my experience, determination—and determination alone—is the ultimate key to success, in all things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Of course, my roots are planted firmly in the field of battle, so perhaps I'm not one to talk on such matters...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huzzaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Aaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hey! Get up! Pull yourself together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm...sorry. I can't... Ghh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Don't talk! Conserve your energy. Just leave the rest to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Curse you, Wratharis! I'll take every one of you on, if I have to! Hyaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Gah! Our formations have broken! We can't hold the line! Company, retreat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You think you can just run away?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's enough, Priscilla!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Rrg... You're right. I'm sorry, Kalmia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's more like it. Feeling a bit calmer now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's a very bad habit of yours to lose your composure in the heat of battle, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'm...aware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Then be aware of this, too. We're knights. It's our primary duty to ensure the safety of the people. But we can't do that if we start rampaging like wild boars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Are you making fun of me? Of my contradictory nature?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I would never! We all get a little "boarish" from time to time. And we all have our own contradictions, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You find pleasure in combat, yet you utterly despise war. That is an internal struggle of some significance. Certainly not something to joke about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Still, I can't help but wonder...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Wonder what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Tell me honestly. Do you...hate Wratharis, Priscilla?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>They were my father's bane. And they took him from me. Part of me can't help wanting to avenge that injustice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But my father and disciple alike stood their ground on the battlefield to protect the people, and I've inherited that duty from them. Fulfilling that duty must be my top priority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It can't be easy to keep your personal emotions out of it, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It's only natural to want to fight tooth and nail for your disciple's sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Besides which, you have such a forthright devotion to your principles, and to the art of the spear... I consider both to be virtues, and you to be a veritable avatar of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You...do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>However! Such virtues won't mean a thing if you die prematurely. All your accomplishments stand to falter if you do. So please, take better care of yourself, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Now, now! Don't pout. You always do that when you feel you've let someone down, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>At least you don't cry like you used to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wait, what's that sound?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Waaah! Daddy! Daddy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You're okay, right? Come on, Daddy! Please wake up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ohhh, no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Dozens of civilians were lost in the chaos of war again. And the orphanage really couldn't take in any more children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Just when is this war going to end?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It always stings deep to hear such lamentations from the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The same desperate question was on the lips of every villager: When will the war end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Sadly, there was no good answer to this question, as the prospect of peace was far from the horizon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The situation was dire for Wratharis when Envylia declared independence, taking all her fertile land with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The remaining lands of Wratharis were mostly barren, forcing the nation to find a means of survival beyond its borders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Having lost much in their war with Envylia, the powers that be in Wratharis believed the country could not flourish on domestic policy alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>They saw war as the only means of survival left for their kingdom. Envylia was forced to repel invasion after invasion, year after year, and the common folk were the ones who paid the price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(This cannot go on forever.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I believe in you, Kalmia. You must end this cycle of hate. You have it in you...to end this war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>And I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I remind myself of those words before every battle. I think back on the future that they were meant to portend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I mustn't let hatred consume me. I will smite the enemy with righteousness, not with wild fury.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I will seal away the dark, abhorrent emotions within me. The question is...how long must I repress them? How long can I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>This is a key point in Envylia's defense! We cannot let them break through! All of you, make ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Rraaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Good! Now, follow me! Huzzaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Glad to see Priscilla's back to her usual spirited self. Morale is always up when she's at her best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>There really is something about her that rubs off on those nearby, isn't there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>The battle seems to be going our way, too. The enemy doesn't have an ace fighter quite on par with Priscilla, as best as we can determine. As long as that remains true, we'll have—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Aaaaarrghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What was that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Y-you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Priscilla...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It's the Ruinmaker! She's come for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Any takers? Let us bring an end to this war, once and for all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>With the Ruinmaker on our side, we're sure to win!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>(Bring an end to the war?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I knew they'd send reinforcements, but I didn't expect it to be you, Ruinmaker. This won't be like before, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You're...? Ah, right. I remember you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I'm more confident than I was last time around. And I've got Kalmia by my side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Isn't that right, Kalmia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Step aside, Priscilla.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I will face the Ruinmaker alone. You assist the effort elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>What? Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I've always wanted to fight the Ruinmaker. Please... Just do this for me, won't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Kalmia? O-okay...</td>
</tr>
