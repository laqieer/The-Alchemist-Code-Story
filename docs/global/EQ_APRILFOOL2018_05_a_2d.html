<td>Captain Yauras! You got a sec?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>So, I get that our mission is in Wadatsumi, and we're gonna follow Kagura and Lord Zain into a cave and whatnot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>However, it caught my interest that, amongst the captains gathered, Captain Kudan's name alone wasn't listed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Is he busy with some other mission? Oh man, or did they just totally forget to call him? We aren't far from port, ya know. There's still time to send him a message.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Are you at it again? I don't have time to explain now, so I'm gonna have you be quiet for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh? Whaâ€”?! Holy Paladin prayers, did the illustrious Captain Yauras just...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You seem to have calmed down a little. Seriously...you're quite the rowdy child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Captain Yauras...ya mind if I ask one last question?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Captain Kudan was really into saying...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>He wanted power. He wanted absolute power that could surpass any other in the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Um... So, is that somehow related to all this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>He himself seems to be trying his best to suppress it, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's too dangerous to let Kudan in his current state touch the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Okay, right... I get ya. There's a possibility that it'll cause Captain Kudan to lose balance within himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes. The reason why Lord Zain removed Kudan from this task was all for his own sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ya mean that a freaking huge darkness exists within Wadatsumi right now, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm sorry to bother you while you're engaged, but we're almost out of the forest. After that, once we cut through the plains, we'll be at the rendezvous point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, the monsters are here to welcome us. Everyone, get into fighting positions. Hurry!</td>
