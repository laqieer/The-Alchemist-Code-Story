<td>002</td>
<td>Hissssssssssssssss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Groogh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hah! Did you see that?! How do you like my Engineer Soldier's beam attack?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The corrupted beasts are scattering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Looks like you've powered up the Soldier since we fought it, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, yeah. The levels of magil are really concentrated around here. The Soldier is almost overpowered!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(I've fixed the Soldier to keep it from absorbing magil from Emmel, but its output is still crazy high... Where is it all coming from?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Perhaps it has something to do with Sephiron?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's possible that this "magil" is the same substance as Sephiron Particles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sephiron...Particles?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>They are a fundamental part of Spiritbonding. Supposedly, the village is full of them, although they are quite invisible to the naked eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Come to think of it, the Engineer Soldier has been working like a dream since I got here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's certainly something I'd like to investigate when we have the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But for now, our priority is helping Julia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hold on, Julia... We're coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So please... Please be all right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Our way forward isn't going to be easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wh-what do you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Aahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>A mass outbreak of corrupted beasts... If left unchecked, Sephiron will deteriorate to a brittle husk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Don't worry, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I-I'm fine. I can't afford to rest until we've saved Julia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Holy hell... There are so many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Don't panic. It's going to be all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>With your Engineer Soldier, Adaleigh, and my powers of purification...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Not to mention my brother's new technique... I know that we will find hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hope...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hell yeah! If we team up, we've got nothing to fear! Not even a swarm of those beasts will stand a chance against us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Say no more. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Graaawwwwrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huzzzzaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Hope... That's it!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(My hope...is to save Emmel from the twisted way of the world...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(To liberate her from the confines of this world tainted by sin. And I will! She will be free!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The history of this world has been warped countless times...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>And on each and every occasion, the world has been altered, and so met its end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That cannot be allowed to happen again. I must protect it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I will be the one to protect this world from those who would attempt to change it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Wh-why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Why? Haa...haaa... Why...would you...think that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>How can you believe that...you can change the world...by hurting people...defiling the tree...corrupting the land...and casting us all into sin?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Nothing you are doing amounts to protecting the world at all! Can you not see how your actions contradict your very goal?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>There are no contradictions here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Sin is the foundation of this world. It must be left undisturbed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>How can you possibly think that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I heard it from the source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Wh-what are you talking about?! The source? What—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>God.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The one who made this world...or at least the present incarnation of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I... I don't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Nothing you are saying makes any sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Humankind has made every effort to survive, despite the weight of their sins upon their shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Struggling, clawing, suffering our way through this cruel world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yet despite it all, I will survive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>For the person I love, and for his beloved little sister!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>That. That is the sin of humankind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Are you...going to kill me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Taking life is not part of my objective here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>How can you say that?! After all the blood you've shed... Did it mean nothing to you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You would unleash the Cursed Beast upon us, and yet you act now in mercy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Do you know how many lives you have endangered? How many people will die at the hands of that creature?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I merely did what was necessary to liberate humankind from sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Do our lives mean nothing to you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Julia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>We're here to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>L-Lady Emmel...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Are you...? What am I saying? You're clearly injured. Emmel, would you treat her wounds?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Lord Nimul, I... Oh... Lord...Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>So...this is that black knight you were talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>That's right! He hurt Julia and attempted to unleash the Cursed Beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Who the hell are you?! Explain yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>From the crown rises the path that will lead us to the kingdom—Ngh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Impossible. Spiritbonding doesn't work on him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Spiritbonding... The ancient art.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>No worries! My Engineer Soldier is on the job!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Ascend from the depths of the sea, oh shapeless one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>What the hell?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>The beam attack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>It was absorbed into the darkness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Something as simple as the light of Alchemia cannot harm me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>N-no way...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Well, then... How about this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Nrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>He recoiled!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Looks like my new technique works on him after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>What was that just now? Something that is neither Spiritbonding...nor magic?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>What is it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>It's a new technique. I developed it myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I'm going to use it to make a new world order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>A new technique...for a new way of the world. I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Come forth, servants of the darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Wh-what's happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Where the hell did they come from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Who are these people?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Now, my servants... Go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Here they come! Get ready!</td>
</tr>
