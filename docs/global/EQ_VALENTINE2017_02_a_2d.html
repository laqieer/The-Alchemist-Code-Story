<td>The brown cacao is the rare cacao. However, it has no particular effect...</td>

<td>The red cacao is the cacao of passion. The orange cacao is the cacao of friendship. The Yellow cacao is the cacao of sincerity...</td>

<td>The green cacao is the cacao of bravery. The blue cacao is the cacao of well-being. The purple cacao is the cacao of captivation...</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh, Albea, your Mechas can help as well? That's amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well...it might lose its handmade effect, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If it's the Mechas then it's fine! Yeah! When we use the lamp, it finishes right away, so it feels a little fake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>All right, Albea's Mechas...please chop this into fine power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
