<td>Headed for the gates of Castle Valderik, the Blue Flame Guard and the Lizard Brigade rest halfway up the mountainous terrain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No matter how many times I see it, it's an odd view.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Seeing the Blue Flame Guard and the Lizard Brigade together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>A few days ago, I would never have been able to predict this situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If you believe in something enough, ideas can really become reality. Right, Sabareta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Logi turns around and sees one of the Lizard Brigade whispering something into Sabareta's ear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It looks like...things won't be that easy after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I've received news.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The Holy Guard are marching towards us from Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Regardless of what you say...it looks like the top brass of Envylia just won't accept us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What do we do? Do we disband here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>W-what're you saying?! Whatever it takes, we're going to persuade them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We're going to have everyone accept you! Right, Agatha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes! Something like this will absolutely not stop us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There may never be another opportunity for Envylia and Wratharis to join hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Heh... I thought you would turn tail and run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Don't try to test our resolve. We're determined in our actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Not one of my Blue Flame Knights will cower over something like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We promise to defend you all until you have an audience with King Patrick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Protect us? Don't be a fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>As long as the Holy Guard are involved, that will be no easy feat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You should be well aware that we'll protect ourselves. Don't underestimate the Lizard Brigade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Sabareta...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We're traveling with you, our sworn enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You're not the only ones who are determined in your actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>However...if the top brass won't listen, just remember that we have our own way of handling things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Heh. Then let's hurry on ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We must minimize casualties and establish peace!</td>
