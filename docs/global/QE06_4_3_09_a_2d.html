<td>Oof. Strength in numbers really doesn't seem to mean a lot to him right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Rraaaaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We'll collapse from exhaustion alone at this rate! Is there no way for us to at least wear him down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Gnn... Hrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Did that do the trick?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No. It's not over yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh, come on, already! Is there really nothing else we can do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If only I could've managed to draw out all of Sumeragi's powers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The Black Star Clan is tasked with the forging of Sumeragi, but for the blade to truly shine, it needs to taste the blood of one of its brethren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, then what are you waiting for? Pull it out and drip some blood, if that's what it takes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You misunderstand. My blood would offer some power, perhaps, but Sumeragi's true brethren would be the Kagomurasaki Clan, and they are...no more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ugh, that figures. Amane! Got any ideas?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(If only Azami were here...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh! Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Maybe... Just maybe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Amane, watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Haaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What are you thinking, rookie? If you've got a plan, then spit it out already! Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It doesn't matter that I lost an arm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'd never forgive myself if we got defeated because we just stood around doing nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Even rushing in without a plan is better than that. I'll be your shield, or whatever else you need. Just stop dawdling and tell me what to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...It's practically a suicide mission, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You still don't get how the Blade Fox works, do you, rookie?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No, unfortunately, I do. Captain Ugachi, please work with Edgar to stop Tamba's movements. Even the smallest opening for just a moment would be good enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Give me that, and we'll get this thing finished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You heard her, Edgar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Sounds to me like her plan involves us just rushing in and dying! What kinda crap plan is that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So, what is my role?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I need you to offer some of your blood to Sumeragi, Jubei...then pass it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>To...you? Butâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Don't worry. As soon as we have our opening with Tamba, I'll give the signal and Logi will use Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What will that accomplish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If I'm right about this...it'll finish this fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Well, it's not like our current plans are getting us anywhere. I'll follow your lead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Same. You got this, Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...Glk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Through the blood of the Black Star Clan...Sumeragi, I offer you this power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Treasure Blade Sumeragi, forged to slay demons... The thoughts and feelings that dwell within the Sacred Three shall serve as our ultimate weapon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>With all three in hand, we cannot lose!</td>
</tr>
