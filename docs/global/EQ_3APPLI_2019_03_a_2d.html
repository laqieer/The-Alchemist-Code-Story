<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes, please, Ragi-Boo.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Nyx, Hiiragi, and Mira are having a rather awkward first date at a restaurant...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>While the rest of us, alongside some of the villagers, watch the uncomfortable scene unfold with bated breath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So sweet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>A-are you...talking about the food?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>No, silly! I'm talking about you, Ragi-Boo. I could just eat you up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>U-um... Nyxie-boo? Wh-what about me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Mira... I made up the nickname Ragi-Boo, and she calls me Nyxie. You've gotta be more original!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>B-but...your name's so short! Give me something to work with here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Do you know what I want to work with, sweet sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>H-huh? How should I know? I-I've never had time to think about love before now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, now that we're here...we have all the time in the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wh-wha...? What're you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Shall I tell you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Urgh... My skin is crawling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>How does it feel to have your younger brother teach you about love?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I-I don't know! That's not the issue here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Such greed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>A-Artemis! Put your bow away! Please! Stay your hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>While we're here...can't you look at me not as your family...but as just a man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Are you being serious?! N-Nyx, you... Do you really...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Now it's your turn, Ragi-Boo. Say "ahh"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Uh... I-I...um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There's no need to be coy. Just say you'll be mine, won't you? I hope to hear those words roll off your lips soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I... I... I-I-I-I-I.... Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>H-hey! Don't forget about me, um...Nyxie-baby!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Baby? Not sure I like that, but I guess I am your baby brother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wh-why don't we feed each other?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's it... Lean on me more. Do what you want with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Mmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Say "ahh"! A-and I want you to feed me, too! C-c'mon, hurry up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Why don't you try using your favorite phrase? You know what I mean. "Right now."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I want you to open your mouth right now, and say "ahh" right now! Right now, right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>C'mon, now. That was a bit sloppy, wasn't it? Make it short and sweet, smooth and sultry. Make me feel your love for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Feed me, right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm not even sure what's happening anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It is fine. She is simply expressing herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Exactly what part of this is fine?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's all very sweet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Has the world gone mad, or have I? She sounds more like a child having a temper tantrum than a cute date.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>All right, sweet sister, open wide and say "ahh"! This is your reward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ugh... Ahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Heheh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wh-what's so funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'm just wondering when you'll give in and fall for me already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Nrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>They've a platonic relationship, haven't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Have they?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh, Ragi-Boo...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>D-don't worry about me. J-just enjoy yourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You've got some food on your cheek! Umgf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Eeeeeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Tch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I feel embarrassed just watching them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>They are terribly awkward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Oh, dear. Mira seems a little...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Huh? Mira? What's up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Aw, don't tell me you were jealous! Do you want a little nibble, too? I used to do that a lot when we were little, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'm really ticked off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>M-Mira! What's wrong with you?! I just said I'llâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Waaaaaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You're so annoying! So...cheeky! You're horrible! This is horrible! This is all just a stupid, stupid farce, and I can't stand one more microsecond of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Are you just bad at being a lover boy? Are you too pure? There should be more...more... Just more! Right now! There's so much more to dating than...whatever this nonsense is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>W-well, not that I've ever actually done this before... I've never had anything to do with romance until now...but I don't think it should be like this! It should be more...normal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>And Nyx! You might be my little brother, but your tactics here are terrible! You're making me cringe, hardcore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Oh, sure... That totally explains why you were blushing earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Mira! Get a hold of yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I can't believe you're like this! We might share the same face, but you...you...! You disgust me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>A-Almace! We must stop Mira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>All right, all right! Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>People of this city, I must ask you to flee! All of you! We will resolve this situation posthaste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>C'mon, Ragi-Boo! Let's get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>O-oh! Um... O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I don't... I don't know what's normal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Normal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I mean... You didn't have fun on our d-date, did you? I made your sister furious, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Nah, Mira's just impatient. Besides, I kinda feel like I'm the one who should be sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Huh? R-really? Well, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Did I seem...insincere? Did I hurt your feelings?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>W-were you just...pretending?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>I knew Mira would get mad, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>That's what I wanted, so I could be alone with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>O-oh! Um...um... Aaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I n-never know what to do when boys... When I... Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I'm the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>N-Nyxie, you're...good at this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Oh, Ragi-Boo. You can just call me Nyx.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Aahh! U-um, well... Y-you know, you could just call me...Hiiragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I don't know what's normal, either. I've been fighting giant monsters left and right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>And now I'm not even sure I know why. What am I fighting for? A normal life... That's not something I'll attain even in my wildest dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I... I feel the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Love is...forbidden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>You can't fall in love?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>It's the Kunoichi Code. We sacrifice our right to fall in love and thus gain our powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Day in, day out, we wake in our village, receive our orders, and fight upon them. Danger lurks beside us on a daily basis, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>That's why love isn't something we can...indulge in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>I knew it. It has to be you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>H-huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>There's no need to hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>B-but...we can't go home unless...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>All will be well, so long as time is correctly maintained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>We don't know anything about normal, or about love, so it's only natural that we would have no idea how to do this normally. It's difficult for us to even fall in love with someone, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>So in the meantime, while we figure ourselves out, why don't we just do something we like. Together. At our own pace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Do you really...mean that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I guess I've been a little...hasty, myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>M-more than just a little!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>All right, Ragi-Boo. Tell me about your hobbies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>That's exactly the sort of...! I want you to stop that! S-stop calling me Ragi-Boo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Wow! I've never seen a stone like this before... It's so pretty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Look, Hiiragi. There's another one over here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Where?! Wow! It's all sparkly! It's so pretty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Check out all these stones I've found. Pretty cool, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Wow! How did you find so many?! They're all so lovely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Ohh! Nyx! You stopped time so that you could collect them without me knowing, didn't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I wouldn't use my technique to play tricks like that. These stones are the result of my careful analysis and investigation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Don't compare me to a layabout like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Pffft!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Heheh. Go on, take any one you like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Mmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Huh? Hiiragi...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Nyx... Don't laugh, okay? M-my hobby is...collecting stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Why would I laugh at that? That's an awesome hobby! Getting to see all these different colors, each of which speaks logically and provides evidence of geological features, makes me feel at peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>R-right! All stones are natural marvels, and no two are the same! Not just in appearance, but in the feel of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>They have different properties based on where they're found, and all kinds of things affect their formation! The surrounding environs, the flow or speed of a riverâ€”even the weather of the region can have an impact!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>It makes traveling all the more excitingâ€”and when I get home, I get to decorate my room with them! I put together different complementary shades, or create displays based on the region in which I found them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Then I just sit back and admire them, and let the memories roll over me! I get endless enjoyment out of the stones I collect. Endless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Aahh! You laughed! You laughed at me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>No, no, no, no... You've got it all wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>H-how so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Seeing you get all excited made me feel really happy. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>O-oh! Um...well... Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Not at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Hurry up and kiss her already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Mira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Ooooraaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Aaaahh! The Lovesickness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>If you kiss in front of the Lovesickness, I bet you'll be cured in an instant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>K-kiss...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>What? You scared?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>M-Mira! We can't just... I mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Don't be silly! Lovers who can't kiss? That's ridiculous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>We've already kissed, haven't we? A long, long time ago, at that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>(He is my little brother, after all.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>If you won't do it, Hiiragi, then I will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Heheh. Tell me how you really feel, Mira...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>W-w-well, why not? It can't be helped! What's a kiss or two? We're family, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>W-wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Oh? If you're going to be my little brother's girlfriend, you've got to get my approval first. Got it? I'm not his big sister for nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Don't, Mira. I don't want you two ladies fighting over me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Not you, too, Ragi-Boo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>You're going to kiss him?! For real?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>No?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Nyxie said...that we could just do something we like together, at our own pace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>B-but I don't want to lose someone who's that good at collecting pretty stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>That's... That's all.</td>
</tr>
