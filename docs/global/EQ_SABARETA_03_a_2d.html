<td>The resurrection of the Deadly Trio... Is such a thing possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Of course. Do you have some keepsake of both General Caesar the Demon Flame and General Neville the Ice Snake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Keepsake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We can transmute more accurately by offering a sacrifice which their soul dwells within. Do you have anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I have one of Caesar here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Is that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Caesar's Shadow Blade. It's the sword he used until his end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So, this is it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Heheh. It's perfect. This will do. First, we'll resurrect General Caesar the Demon Flame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh General Caesar the Demon Flame! Answer the anger and sorrow of us whose native land has been trampled on. Return to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Aghh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It burns... My body burns... Who has summoned back my wrathful soul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Caesar? Caesar, is that you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Vlad! So, you survived. I never expected to return to this blood-soaked world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Caesar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You have nothing to apologize for. In fact, I'm grateful to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If you hadn't survived, I wouldn't have had this chance to return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I won't forget Blood Wolf Zeke's acts of destruction! I'll personally kill him myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Caesar, look at what you've become. Can you still not erase the rage you felt when you were alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>My rage remains because of what I've become.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>My body has rotted away in the flames of wrath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yet, my anger and hatred towards Envylia continue to burn eternally!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I understand, Caesar. Let's have Neville assist us as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Sabareta, I accept your proposal. We'll use the Deadly Trio's wrath to set fire to this rebellion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm indebted to you. Now that that's decided, we must quickly resurrect General Neville.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Neville's keepsake Ice Snake was apparently returned to his place of birth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>However, I hear that land is currently under the jurisdiction of Envylia's aristocrats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's no problem. Come on, let's awaken the last of the Deadly Trio!</td>
