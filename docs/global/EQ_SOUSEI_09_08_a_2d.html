<td>001</td>
<td>This tree, I shall call Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This great tree, which has been fed the blood of dragons... The soil upon which it rests will one day birth the child destined to create the new world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Those connected with this child shall grow stronger than any other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>They shall bear the sephirah. Born from the mixing of human and dragon blood, they shall be inexorably linked with nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But is all of that truly necessary?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I am uncertain. Which is why I must leave it to be determined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The next time this choice must be made, I will no longer be alive to make it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ah. That's right. You will die as well, won't you, Matia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Of course. After all, I am only human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I somehow had the impression that you might live forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You flatter me. But no matter how highly a human may be regarded, every human must inevitably die. It is a fact of life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Though I do think I could have lived a better one of those. There simply wasn't enough conflict for my taste. I would have liked more reason to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What's the point of strength if there is no combat with which to hone it? All that remains without it is decay and diminishment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I wish I could have truly tested my mettle, alongside my will and my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ha. You never change, always going on about the glory of combat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It is my joy and happiness. I cannot help thinking of it, when I take such great pleasure in its pursuit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If, by some chance, a miracle should occur, and I should be able to fight on behalf of another once again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I would not hesitate for a moment. I would delight in spilling more blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm sorry to say, I will be praying that such a time never comes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>How hurtful! I thought we were friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Finished already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The Dragon Realm... Perhaps best referred to as a temple now, given the ceremony? It is indeed a place of great power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But when the one with domain over it is in such a sorry state, none of that means a thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wh-why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Why what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If this continues, the world will be swallowed by corruption and destroyed. Even you must know that. In fact, because of who you are, there is no chance you are unaware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You are of the Sephira. Why ally yourself with Ouroboros?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If I must die, I've always wished it to be in the field of battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It seems like such a foolish regret to concern myself with, looking back. But, I just can't help it! It's who I am. Farewell, Ophioneus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's finished, Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...Hmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The will of the Cursed Beast lingers. It would be most bothersome were it to get in the way of those humans who shall next make their play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Shall I take your magil and overwrite it with something a bit more to my liking, Lucifer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Just as you did when we were created? Hmph. Are you trying to flood the board with pieces now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Only make the best use of the pieces already in play, I assure you. Though humans certainly do seem prone to playing the numbers game in situations like this, don't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hmm... Here's an idea. Let's bring back that one man. The one who killed more humans than any other, if memory serves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What was his name again? Ignacio, I believe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well, well. How nostalgic. I certainly didn't expect to meet you again here. Decided to crack open the lid of the hell pot and let some steam escape, did you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You certainly like playing with fire, don't you, Ouroboros?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Don't say that. I'm a professional, you know! I've never once done any less than my best, and I take great pride in that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>My Wrath is a righteous flame...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(That strike... I put a lifetime's worth of experience into it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(And now, in this place...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(I must replicate it!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oho!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I shall commit the full power of my Wrath into my blade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It went through?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ha! How precious. Did you really think that would work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I recognize that power. At the top of the tower, that man used the same thing. Alchemy, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I don't...believe so? It's nothing like what Nimul can do, with the wind and the ice and everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>All I'm doing is committing my full self to each swing of the sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Shameful. You don't even understand the power you wield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>But I will recognize that strength, nonetheless. And in so doing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I shall change my own strategies and meet you where you stand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Leviathan?! Andechs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I have been given a portion of the power Ouroboros has at hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>It is time for you to drown in the endless sea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>"We are the ones who embrace Envy..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>"My body is a shield, a silver barrier that blocks and breaks all that attempt to cross it!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Think you can block this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Nrgk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>(I can't push through! Even if I could cut it with my sword, the makeup of the magil is too different!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It's like we're fighting a Cursed Beast itself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yes... But luckily, we have allies on our side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What? What is the meaning of this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>All right, we're up and running! Took us a bit to get the hang of the magil in this place, but we figured it out in the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Daphne! Andechs! We're keeping her held in place! Now's your chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Space-Time Manipulation? That takes me back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Uh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I can't say I understand the exact parameters of the technique, but if all you've done is slow down time for my body movement, then there's a simple solution: I'll just move even faster!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Agh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>She made an explosion with her magil to propel herself forward and attack, almost like she shot herself from a cannon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>This is what's required to pierce the scales of a dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Let's see if you're any tougher than that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Show me that my faith in your potential has not been wasted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>What are youâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
