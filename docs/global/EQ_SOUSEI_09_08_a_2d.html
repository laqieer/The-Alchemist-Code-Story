<td>This great tree, which has been fed the blood of dragons... The soil upon which it rests will one day birth the child destined to create the new world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female Voice</td>
<td>Those connected with this child shall grow stronger than any other.</td>

<td>They shall bear the sephirah. Born from the mixing of human and dragon blood, they shall be inexorably linked with nature.</td>

<td>But is all of that truly necessary?</td>

<td>I am uncertain. Which is why I must leave it to be determined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female Voice</td>
<td>The next time this choice must be made, I will no longer be alive to make it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Godwolf</td>
<td>Ah. That's right. You will die as well, won't you, Matia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>Of course. After all, I am only human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Godwolf</td>
<td>I somehow had the impression that you might live forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>You flatter me. But no matter how highly a human may be regarded, every human must inevitably die. It is a fact of life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>Though I do think I could have lived a better one of those. There simply wasn't enough conflict for my taste. I would have liked more reason to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>What's the point of strength if there is no combat with which to hone it? All that remains without it is decay and diminishment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>I wish I could have truly tested my mettle, alongside my will and my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Godwolf</td>
<td>Ha. You never change, always going on about the glory of combat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>It is my joy and happiness. I cannot help thinking of it, when I take such great pleasure in its pursuit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>If, by some chance, a miracle should occur, and I should be able to fight on behalf of another once again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>I would not hesitate for a moment. I would delight in spilling more blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Godwolf</td>
<td>I'm sorry to say, I will be praying that such a time never comes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>How hurtful! I thought we were friends?</td>

<td>The Dragon Realm... Perhaps best referred to as a temple now, given the ceremony? It is indeed a place of great power.</td>

<td>If this continues, the world will be swallowed by corruption and destroyed. Even you must know that. In fact, because of who you are, there is no chance you are unaware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cursed Beast Lucifer</td>
<td>You are of the Sephira. Why ally yourself with Ouroboros?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>Simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>If I must die, I've always wished it to be in the field of battle.</td>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>It's finished, Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>...Hmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>The will of the Cursed Beast lingers. It would be most bothersome were it to get in the way of those humans who shall next make their play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Shall I take your magil and overwrite it with something a bit more to my liking, Lucifer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>Just as you did when we were created? Hmph. Are you trying to flood the board with pieces now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Only make the best use of the pieces already in play, I assure you. Though humans certainly do seem prone to playing the numbers game in situations like this, don't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>Hmm... Here's an idea. Let's bring back that one man. The one who killed more humans than any other, if memory serves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros</td>
<td>What was his name again? Ignacio, I believe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Well, well. How nostalgic. I certainly didn't expect to meet you again here. Decided to crack open the lid of the hell pot and let some steam escape, did you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>You certainly like playing with fire, don't you, Ouroboros?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Don't say that. I'm a professional, you know! I've never once done any less than my best, and I take great pride in that.</td>
