<td>Hmph! I don't need your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Are they resonating with Yomi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Leafah, run!</td>

<td>As if I could leave you!</td>

<td>Some homecoming this is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Kagura, from the 5th Regiment of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The Holy Guard...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I am the only remaining member of the royal family of Wadatsumi, the last of the house of Rising Ashes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The Shiba Senko have been particularly busy recently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Cooperation between organizations is crumbling everywhere, even here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Reimei must be tossing and turning in his grave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>L-Lady Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Yomi. Long time no see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Yes, it has been a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I must be clear. It is unacceptable for anyone, including and especially the head of the Kagomurasaki Clan, to be sowing discord here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Th-that's not what's happening! Those are the lies that the Shiba Senko have been spreading to turn people against us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>So you're saying that everything they've been saying is false?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I know that the Mikaboshi is in there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>In...Yomi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What is the meaning of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Yomi, are you feeling better?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Drop the act, both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Do you really expect me to believe that the General of Greed Dike has no idea what is happening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It has not gone under the radar that Greed Dike has been pouring resources into the colonization and rebuilding of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Of course we have. That's why we've committed to working with the Kagomurasaki Clan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>And you expect me to believe that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Whether or not you believe it, Greed Dike's intention here in Wadatsumi is to create a country open to the rest of the world, filled with people who have learned to smile again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Your words stink of naivete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Did you just call me the Baby General?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Wh-what? I said nothing of the sort!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>How dare you treat me like a child?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>How dare I? I just...do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>There's not exactly a methodology. You act like a child, I treat you like one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Y-you...?! Act like...? I just have a baby face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Oh no, did I make the wittle puppet General cry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Y-you're the worst! I hate you! Yomi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>L-Lady Kagura, why must you be this way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I'm just illustrating what a farce this all is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Wadatsumi attacked by Greed Dike, the Shiba Senko gaining strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Greed Dike occupying Wadatsumi at the Shiba Senko's invitation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>The last successor of the Shiba Senko dead...and yet, so many of them still so loyal...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Odd, isn't it? That a leaderless clan would be so bold?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>What are you trying to say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I'm saying that this must be more than coincidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Specifically, I'm saying that Greed Dike must be working with the Shiba Senko.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I've been fighting against the Shiba Senko this whole time! Why would I do that if we were working with them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>This information comes from interrogating certain soldiers from Greed Dike I stumbled across on my way here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>If what they said conflicts with what you know, then... Well, it seems you have quite the problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>N-no... I'm...the General. There's no way I wouldn't know what...Greed Dike...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I have to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Where exactly are you planning to go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>To the headquarters of the Shiba Senko.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>The funeral still hasn't been held...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Funeral?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>For...my brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>His...remains...were stolen.</td>
</tr>
