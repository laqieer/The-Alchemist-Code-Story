<td>H-huh? There's not much security at all. Is everyone fighting outside?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>And leaving the inner castle and the queen unprotected?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You're right. It's odd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Aghh! Y-you...Corpse...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...! O-oh now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Y-you...Lisbeth?! Are you telling me that the mages sent to the school have been defeated?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't move! I'm gonna heal you now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ack...the queen! I will sacrifice my life—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wh-what's this...?! Don't do something stupid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sh-she vanished?! Where?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Rebecca...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>She...transformed herself into magic energy. Most likely, she did it to give power to her fellow mages...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What are you talking about? Then...where did she go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Rebecca?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The witches of Lustburg have a long lifespan because of Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The court mages are all mostly veterans, and they have a lifespan that matches that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>She chose...her own end...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Where...did she go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>People...don't go anywhere, Lisbeth! They vanish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No...no! Why did she...erase her own life?! If you die, there's nothing left!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Liz...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If she stayed alive...if only she stayed alive...we could've fixed this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Even if we get hurt, we can heal; if we mess up, we can start again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No matter how many hundreds of years we live...there is still more joy to experience. But she...she...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Alma? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That mage...didn't she say Corpse at the end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>She did say something like that. What about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Let's go, Liz. Let's continue forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Sob...Alma...I...couldn't save her. I couldn't stop her from dying right in front of me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>She made that choice on her own. That's how dedicated she was. Now it's your turn to resolve yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Resolve...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yes, resolve. You need it now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The road you're headed for is a thorny one, Liz...in various ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>In various ways? What are you trying to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This is just a guess...but I think that Paladin is here in the castle with the queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I don't know the circumstances...but let's just keep going, Liz. If we're going to find out everything, now is our chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You can save many more lives than those that have died here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The court mages are exhausted. What happened here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Let's just heal them for now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Lisbeth?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Why are all these terrible things happening at once?! This is the third attack on the castle today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The third?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>First you, then the Bugmail, and then the Corpse. Today has been a troublesome day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I never attacked the castle! I just wanted to talk to the queen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>How can I trust you after you tried to infiltrate the castle?! You've threatened this castle and the Queen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Stop it! You shouldn't be fighting in that condition—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Enough...prepare yourself!</td>
