<td>Jeez. That's one annoying dog.</td>

<td>That said, I didn't expect us to be returning to Redington.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Tsk. I feel like that idiot with his massive arm is gonna be merrily waiting for us there.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hey, are you an acquaintance of Don's?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well...we have one of those insufferable yet inseparable bonds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hey, you don't have to worry. The guy is evil, but he's not sleazy enough to harm girls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You'll be able to keep living in Real Heaven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>A-are you serious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yeah. But why did he go after you, little lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>He's not the kind of guy who would try to win favor with the Beckrams.</td>

<td>Mr. Taras said that it was a moral obligation.</td>

<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There's no other bridge nearby that leads to Redington.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Unless we cross the Pulte Canal we can't get to the clock tower!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We can't afford to have a flashy showdown on the bridge. Tsk, it seems like we may break a few bones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>There's an ox cart over there. Do you think we can get this motorbike onto it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>An ox cart? What're you planning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Forcing our way through isn't the only way, you know? Use your head. Well, just watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The Hound is approaching us from behind, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Again? Honestly, what an annoying dog!</td>
