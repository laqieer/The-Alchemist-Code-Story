<td>Ah! This turbulence is terrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It hasn't been this rough since we crossed from the Luxuria Belt to the Acedia Belt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This can only be Beelzebub increasing in power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This is bad. From the very moment we enter this region it's possible that we will encounter the Cursed Beast. Don't let down your guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I know that already! That's why we excavated Icona's Protocol from all that rubble, remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Worst case scenario, the Cursed Beast Captivity Protocol will buy us enough time to get the airship to safety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You seem pretty confident, huh! Aren'tcha just throwing the responsibility this way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Honestly, I've got my hands full syncing Libra up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Calm down, Mira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Buuuut...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It can't be helped. We're the most proficient in handling magil, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Waginau and Nimul don't seem to have the best compatibility with magil...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My apologies...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>In any case, the protection of Sephira that Waginau and I carry has the risk of causing the magical devices to malfunction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Should that happen, it might be worth considering the possibilities of someone who carries a lot of magil...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Don't look at me like that. I know nothing of wielding magic, so the details of controlling magil are most certainly lost on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Argh, I can't work under these conditions! The fact that we're the only ones busy here really sucks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, this probably won't make you feel any better, but I think that might change when Eulalia joins us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Really, Nimul?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes. She's a prodigy of magil manipulation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Her natural ability as a Vessel of Purification may not exceed Emmel's, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Her power to summon spirits far surpasses anyone else's among the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>After a time, because of that ability, she was forbidden from taking part in ceremonies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If it wasn't for that, then Eulalia may have been the next Vessel of Purification...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What happened, Adaleigh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We made it through the barrier, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What the heck... It hasn't been that long, but things have really...escalated...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What are you on about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This is Nimul's village? But it looks so different from what you said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes... This is no longer a place for people. It has completely been devoured by corruption...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Unbelievable to think that Beelzebub has this kind of power...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's grown much more than we'd ever imagined! What should we do, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Avoiding it is no longer an option. If we allow Beelzebub to grow any more, we won't be able to defeat it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We can't get any closer to the village. Approaching that big tree is also out. So our destination is...the desert?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No. First, let's go to the great Forest of Suga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>If the corruption has progressed this far, we are in a race against time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I hope the villagers in the desert will forgive me, but we must find Eulalia first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>From where we once calmed the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Our destination is a hidden village further inland.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Roger! Changing course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Emmel... Please. Be safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Truly magnificent. You have not only stored the cores of two Cursed Beasts in your body, you have endured it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>It is futile. Your powers of purification have no hope of affecting my corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You cannot hide your consumption, sacrificial daughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'm not a sacrifice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wrong. Your body is a sacrifice pledged to the Cursed Beasts. The price of a single life that is paid for a peace that has continued for centuries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It is a forgone conclusion that a human vessel storing the cores of two Cursed Beasts should experience some...irregularities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>As it is, you will be lucky to have a year of life remaining.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Don't tell me... You planned this from the start? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Don't be ridiculous. Why would I bother to plot anything for so pathetic an existence as a human?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It is merely that if you die before that man appears, your use as a hostage would be wasted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Humans are content with even the most pathetic of existences. Even if you must choke down mud and cough up blood, even plunge into corruption...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That is the difference between you and I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You're back, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>What? Why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>My apologies, but I believe that dealing with the remaining villagers of the Sephira will take some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>There is no need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Those willful pursuers of Greed, arrogantly rejecting the way of the world, will come to regret setting foot in these lands...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Then I take my leaveâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>You, follow them. Where they have tread, there will be survivors of this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Understood! For the sake of a new world order, we Sinners will do whatever it takes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Yes... Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Soon. At last, the Cursed Beast Beezlebub will be complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>But first, we must remove all obstacles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Aren't you Julia? I... I'm... so scared...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I do not know her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>B-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Allow me to address your misconception.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Wha...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Those who have succumbed to corruption can never return to what they were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>The girl you once knew is no longer. The life she lived; the road she walked... None of it has anything to do with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I am not her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I do not know her, nor do I plan to learn of her. I have no interest in who "I" was before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>That's...so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Julia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Because that is nothing less than my duty...and what I wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I wanted to protect you, my lady, and Lord Nimul as well. So long as I was of use... That is all I need to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>No! Julia, if you use your purification powers with a wound like that, y-you'll...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Please don't make such a face. With this...my soul will remain intact. I can die without ever falling to the corruption of sin. There is no greater happiness in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>No! What are you saying?! You don't mean that! Y-you were meant to...t-take care of my brother...for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>That was your wish, Emmel. Not mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Hmhm... You cannot cleanse me of the corruption. It is too late. There is nothing that can be done for me now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Julia... If you come into contact with the Sinners... If you let the corruption fester...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Listen to me, my lady. You must make your own wish come true. After all... Isn't that what dreams are? Wishes that we must...fulfill...for ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>This is...all my fault...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>If I had been stronger back then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>If I had just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I'm sorry...! I'm so, so sorry, Julia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Auugghhhhhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The corruption has spread to this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>The village of Suga hides behind a barrier that repels outsiders. From this point, we must go on foot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>We were able to land the airship and hide it behind the mountain for now, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>We will likely need to make a swift departure after we find Eulalia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We will also need someone to stay and watch over the airship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>In that case, I'll stay here. Not like you can fly this without me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'll stay as well. It might be best to have someone who can communicate over Space-Time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Oh, you're wonderful for volunteering, Nyx! I'll gladly go with Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'll stay. It is possible that there are Sephira hiding in that village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>My presence might make them feel uneasy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Then I will go to defend Nimul and the others. Is that acceptable?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Yes. Let's hurry. There's no time to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>What? You got a problem, old dog?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Can you quit it with that already?!</td>
</tr>
