<td>I was always giving my brother trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Knocking over toys and baskets while I played...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>As I watch the memories unravel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>A winding river, reminiscent of the River Styx, appears before me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I can't go back, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sumeragi is no more. My demon powers have run dry. I feel...hollow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I tried to shoulder all the burdens of my family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I tried to move forward, using the dream I shared with my brother to guide me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I tried to keep pace with my friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I tried so incredibly hard—and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>After all that, no matter how hard I tried... Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>How long are you going to keep chasing me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A voice...from the other side?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tag is a children's game.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I know this voice. I know it so well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The sun is setting. You ought to go home soon, before it gets dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I...I want to! I want to go home! B-but...it's so dark, and...and...I have no home to go back to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If you open your eyes, you will see the starry sky, even in blackest night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't leave behind the people that are important to you.</td>

<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But...I...!</td>

<td>I've lost...everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Corruption is the doing of man—and so it is man that must carry it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>There is no such thing as a world without corruption. The ninja will carry the weight of this truth on their shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You, however...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You have the noble task of guiding them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Have you forgotten everything you've worked for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Surrounded by allies, you have no blind spots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Had you forgotten?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I just...took a little detour.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I know. You're a hard worker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Walking with your back bowed, basket full of worries... You pass your wares on, and now...it's empty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Fill up your empty basket, bow your back, and head to your friends' sides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Standing up, now, are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Y-Yomi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>My life flashed before my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>And yet...here you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The memories I saw were all...happy. A happy past—a peaceful dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I can't let it end there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I won't give up until a happy future is in my past!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh, Yomi. It is far too late for that. Now that I have unleashed corruption upon the world, I am afraid that there is nothing you can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Do you know how the wind blows?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It rushes from big spaces to small ones, from crowded spaces to sparse ones...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The bigger the difference, the harder it blows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What of it? The wind is irrelevant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>D-don't tell me...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Relax your shoulders. Empty yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>In your mind's eye, it spins on and on, around and around...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I call out to the corruption in this world, and I beseech it—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Return unto me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What?! What is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I was waiting for this moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>The moment that the Kagomurasaki rises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Now, taste of the secret technique of my clan! Behold, Kagomurasaki!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The true role of my clan was not only to store corruption...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It was also to purify it, and restore it to the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>L-look! Corruption is swirling around Yomi...like a whirlwind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That technique, the Kagomurasaki... It's devouring corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I-it's transferring to Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>M-my corruption! My precious, beautiful corruption! The Mikaboshi! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Do not leave me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You...! Will you feast upon it all, you glutton?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Heed me, Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>If you would slake your thirst on hatred and grief, amplifying corruption in the hearts of humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>If you would seek a turning point in our corruption-laced history...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>This is your chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Together, we will create a new era! Come, join our ranks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Y-Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>We will persevere until the very end, drawing strength from the past!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>No doubt about it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Mikaboshi! I beseech you to be an ally of Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You...?! What are you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>It was the mutual wish for peace, shared by humans and demons alike, that brought you into this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>If you would manifest corruption and turn us into demons...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Then take my blighted prayers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I know! I'm a greedy little child! I'm pathetic! I never know when to quit! But this is my final wish—the wish I have been chasing all this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>W-wait! This cannot possibly—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>My brother—Jin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Give...him...back...to...me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Welcome back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I'm glad you're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Jin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Thank you, Yomi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Nnnggggrrhhhh! Grrraaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggghhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Your power, this world's corruption—all of it is now mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Grrraaarrrrrrgggghhhh! You! You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Everything is my burden to bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Human and demon as one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Let's fulfill our promise to one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Long have I awaited this moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Today's meeting, like the blue moon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Has been fated since those bygone days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooooooooorrrrrggggghhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>The demon horde ends here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Now, we exorcise demons.</td>
