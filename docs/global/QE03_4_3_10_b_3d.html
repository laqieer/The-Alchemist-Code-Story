<td>...Uub...uck...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Liz...sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I said you should rest, but...uh...can you fly on your own from here? I...can't just stand by and let her die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Rebecca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>She was a lonely, lonely queen who continued to fight and lead her people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That pain...I understand it. I can't let her fall like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's what I thought you would say, Rebecca. Please...support the queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Who would've thought I'd actually use it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm just going to use everything that I've got!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Go...Liz!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lis...beth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...It's okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The reason why you weren't loved was because the witches of this country were afraid of love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But you loved this country unconditionally and without fear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>There were witches who fought for you in response to your love. Even if the curse is removed, I'm sure there are witches that won't abandon you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Just like Alma and Rebecca stood by my side when I was attacked by those around me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm sure there are those who love you from the bottom of their hearts. Just like your parents loved each other when they gave birth to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So don't turn away from those who love you anymore...like you did with that photo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Promise...to love this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm sure it will become warm enough...for you to truly love as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Take my resolve with you as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We're relying on you...Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Wh-where?! Where is...Asmodeus?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>There are too many clouds! I can't see it! Wh-what should I do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Whoa...oh dear! I-I'm really starting to get queasy... No...please...just a bit more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Something sparkled just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh...it's just the light from the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ohh...it's getting so dark. The clouds are so black. I can't see anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>No...I can't let everyone's resolve...go to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'll leave the rest to you, Liz! Rebecca! Tell me all about what's up above the clouds later!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Alma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Go...Liz!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Rebecca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Just look for what to do...step by step.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Onward...Lisbeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>They all entrusted their resolve to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Wh-what's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Each of these lights...has a separate life of their own...their own happiness...and unhappiness...so many different feelings...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No matter how dark the clouds, there is always a silver lining. No matter how bad something may be, there is always good to it as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No matter how bad something may be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The curse of Asmodeus was a necessity for this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Still...everyone wants to be free from the curse! Even the queen...entrusted this to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>When all the people truly seek it, Asmodeus may appear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Everyone is seeking it now! Everyone...has entrusted this to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>They're all relying on...a loser like me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If you find "him" up above the clouds, say hi for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Please, Lisbeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Please...Asmodeus! I need you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The clouds...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It's...beautiful! Is this it? Is this the silver lining?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Th-this is it! It's similar to the stone that Dias had! This must be it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I finally...reached it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm getting sleepy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Just...five minutes more...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Seriously. I've watched you from the window before, but you're really a sleepy head, aren't you, Liz?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Who are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Mr. Ant?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>If you don't wake up, you're going to make your mother sad. Come on now. Wake up and show us your cheerful face...for Katya...and for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Father...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...Everyone!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Dias...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You did it, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>It's been a while since I've seen such a strong woman. You did so well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I'm surprised. The battle scars usually don't disappear so easily. That's because there usually aren't many survivors, so it takes a while to rebuild.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>But this conflict resulted in minimal casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It helps that Venus didn't die either. We were able to keep the chaos to a bare minimum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>It's all thanks to this witch who went out of her way to heal those she defeated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Not only did she beat this twisted country into shape, but she healed it afterwards as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>This little girl pretty much played the role of a good mother to this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>With the current crisis, both men and women are working together to rebuild the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>The men are disposing of the rubble, and the women are distributing food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It's still pretty disorganized, but eventually, they'll probably all remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>They'll look up at the cloudless sky and realize how natural it is for men and women to support each other like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Aghh! This is way too hot to drink when it isn't freezing outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Oh? I served it to you because I heard you were from Slothstein. Did it not suit your tastes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Usually, local specialties aren't well appreciated by the locals themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>That being said, I get to drink with such a beautiful woman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Maybe it's not the alcohol's fault. Maybe my heart is the one that's on fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Are you trying to seduce a woman with a full-grown child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>A full-grown child...right. Are you not going to send her off?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Why would I need to send off my daughter when she's coming back home eventually? Are you going to be leaving soon as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Yep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I'm glad I came here to Lustburg. I got to see her dream come to life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>...! He-here he comes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Weren't you the one that called me here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>It's best not to talk about the Sacred Stone in front of others. We should have more privacy here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Ye-yes! Um...there's that too, but...well...there's something else I want to talk about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Ohh! Um, the Sacred Stone, right?! H-here it is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I'm impressed that you would share it with me, but aren't you giving it up a little too easily?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>The queen said the same thing, but...I trust you, Dias, and the queen is trying to make up for her sins right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>When you said you were going to ask the queen about Arestorus, I'll admit you scared me a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>The court mages didn't attack you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>They were actually afraid of me because I had Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I see. Who would've thought that the curse which plagued this country would come in handy like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Ultimately though, when I showed the queen she said, "It's fine now. Give it to the Holy Guard." I don't think it's been reset yet though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>It appears as though it has already been reset. When you came falling from the sky, the curse was already removed from the stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Didn't you reset it yourself? You must've inherited the magic of Arestorus from somebody.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>What? When did that happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Maybe it was from the headmistress? The time she touched her Broom Ace...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Is it that easy to inherit magic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Liz's Broom Ace is a really old one. I'm sure it's been exposed to all sorts of magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>It shouldn't be that difficult for a Broom Ace with that much memory in it to inherit the headmistress' magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Maybe Liz was destined to save this country from the moment she chose that Broom Ace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I see. Wait...who cares about that right now?! Don't we have something more important than Sacred Stones to be discussing right now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I'm not sure about that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Regardless of how it happened, the reset has been completed. Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>This Sacred Stone doesn't have long to live. It is rapidly losing power since it is no longer consuming the life source of men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>O-oh no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I'm sure that's another reason why the queen entrusted it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Her plan must be to come up with a new defense and give up this Sacred Stone that no longer has the power to protect her country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>By giving up Asmodeus to the Holy Guard while the stone is still alive, she knows that we will now be in her debt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>What a devious queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Does that mean...I wasn't able to help you very much, Dias? Ohh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>No, you have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>The Sacred Stones attract each other. As long as this stone is still alive, it may lead me to another Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Besides...it's been a while since I've seen the radiance of someone who is fighting for others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>To be honest...I was moved by the beauty of your actions. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>There's a lot of potential between those two, isn't there?! Oh wow, I'm starting to get nervous as well! Huh, Rebecca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I don't know how to describe it properly. I feel really nervous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>It's like I'm a mother whose daughter is taking the exam for the royal palace's recruitment program.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>You're seeing this from a mother's perspective?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Please, do not compromise your way of living. Don't become twisted...like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Dias...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>What's the matter? You look like you want to say...something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>What?! Oh! Well...um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>...Liz!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>... ...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Well, Dias...you must already have someone special in your life...right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Well...u-um...I...I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Yes...I do have someone special. I am looking for the other Sacred Stones so that I can meet that person again. I must leave now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Oh...I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>You can't give up! Stand your ground! Tell him! Tell him everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Do your best, Liz!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>What are you hesitating about? You still have a lot to do, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>You want to create a country where men and women can coexist, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>In that case, wouldn't your main priority be returning those who become insects into humans again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Y-yes! But...I don't know how I can find a way to do that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Saga. If there's one place that may hold the answer, it would be in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Saga?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>In Saga, different species live together in harmony. You may find useful examples for your country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Also, there is a habitat for dragons there. Dragons only live in places that are clean and pure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>You may find a way to cleanse your curse there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Saga... You might be right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>I'm sure you'll be able to find a way. I, too, have work that I must accomplish. This is where we say farewell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>No...um...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>I'm sure we'll meet again somewhere. That is what I believe and hope for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>What? Hope for...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>I would like to meet you again. It's not in my nature, but, for some reason, being around you makes me feel energized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Dias!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>So...let's meet again, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>...! Yes!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>That's right...I still have things I must do. Right now I need to focus solely on accomplishing these things!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Hey, young lady! We should leave soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Right, got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>That being said, it doesn't seem like anyone's here to send you off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>No, that's because I left in secret. After all, if anyone were here to send me off...I'd probably start crying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Well, I guess there's that. All right then, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>...She's gone now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Thank you...Liz. You've allowed happiness to blossom in this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Whoaaa?! What's this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Look at those witches up in the sky! Who knew they could fly that high?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Huh? What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Did you think you could just sneak away like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>That's just lame, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Oh...ohh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Everyone...why?! How did you know I was leaving?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Well, um, I wonder why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>W-wait...were you eavesdropping on my conversation with Dias?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>We would never...or that's what I thought, but...well, you made us so nervous, Liz!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Nooooo!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Liz! Well...sorry for everything until now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Are you really leaving?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>You're an amazing person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Everyone...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Whoaa?! Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>What...eeek!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>You just had to pull a dangerous move in the end, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>You're the first and last witch to ever fly without a Broom Ace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Sob...Alma! Rebecca...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>What are you crying about, silly...sob...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>You better come back safely! Until then, I'll make this country even better than before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>O-okay...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Hey...can you bring her over here now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>We need to give her the perfect send off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Right...let's make it good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Let's give it...everything we've got!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Off you go! Alma Shoot!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>It's been a while since I've come here, but the town is a little noisier than I remember. Be careful, young lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Got it! Thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Um... First, I should greet the "chieftain," right? I wonder where I can find this person. Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Um...excuse me! Where can I find...the chieftain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>U-um...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>I am Tina, the 45th chieftain of Toxotes. Sorry if I'm smaller than you expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Whaaaat?!</td>
</tr>
