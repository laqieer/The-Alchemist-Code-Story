<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>The village of Lezario. Mansion of Chief Adone of the Toxotes tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Tina...have you performed the Ritual of Baptism?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes. I met Asena and received guidance as a shaman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ah. So you finally inherited the role as chief! Adone...a weight has been lifted from your shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And...what was the color of your soul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The color of her soul...? Why do you ask such things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Our tribe belongs to the Water Sprite Voda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Of course, it should be blue like water, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It was emerald, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>?! Y-yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Emerald...?! Does that mean...her power lies within the wind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It appears so. During our battle just now, I could feel a holy wind within Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>W-wait! A wind shaman?! How is that possible?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm surprised as well. Who would've thought...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ever since the destruction of the Alize people, none have appeared in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What is going on? If that is true, word of this cannot be kept to our tribe alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This is something that may very well shake the future of each tribe...of all of Saga itself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Calm down. News of this has still not gone out to the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Father...I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Destiny guides you. Very well...retire for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh! Please, wait! There is one thing I must tell you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>At the place where the Ritual of Baptism was held, I received another strange revelation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Another strange revelation...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes! Most likely, what I saw was the not-so-distant future of Saga. It was a land burning in flames!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Burning in flames...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>There I saw the tribes of Saga clashing with one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The forest...the prairies...all of it was burning...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And then...I saw something terrifying...something that I never thought could exist in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What the...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It was a dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>A single gigantic dragon...was crying out amidst the burning land!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Are you saying that's the future of Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yes...that's what I was told.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>A dragon! Could it be...the work of the Tehre?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The Tehre, the earth shamans....I'm saying that it may be them who's behind it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Right now, they are actively breeding and feeding dragons. They use Port Nahema to then ship them off to different countries!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>They are a greedy bunch who are willing to twist the laws of nature to wield those once-feared dragons as a business device!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Elder...we are not certain of that yet. Do not rush to judge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>If this land were to become scorched earth, they would suffer the same damage we would. I doubt they would do something so self-destructive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>For starters, let's investigate the Tehre factionâ€™s movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Understood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The once extinct power of the wind has once again appeared in this world. That may hold some deeper meaning...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>If so...that revelation you saw...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The invasion of Gluttony...the bird of a wind shaman...and that revelation you saw...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>In any case, we must deliver a report to the Sprite Trio. Leave the rest to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Very well. Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Sigh... It looks we've got trouble ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Tina! Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...! What's the matter...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>There's a strange creature in the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Glurp...glurrpppp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Ack...no way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Glurp...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What is going on?! They've never attacked the village before...why now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Glurp...! Glurrrp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh...?! Wh-whoa...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I won't make it...! Don't touch that!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Whaaaaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Ack...! Horaaahhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Gurrr...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Th-thank you, sir...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Agh...! A-are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Did the Jam get you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Ti-Tina...everyone is still outside the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ack...take me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I'll go too!</td>
</tr>
