<td>The village of Lezario. Mansion of Chief Adone of the Toxotes tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>Tina...have you performed the Ritual of Baptism?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Yes. I met Asena and received guidance as a shaman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>Ah. So you finally inherited the role as chief! Adone...a weight has been lifted from your shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>And...what was the color of your soul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>The color of her soul...? Why do you ask such things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>Our tribe belongs to the Water Sprite Voda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>Of course, it should be blue like water, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>It was emerald, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>?! Y-yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>Emerald...?! Does that mean...her power lies within the wind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>It appears so. During our battle just now, I could feel a holy wind within Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>W-wait! A wind shaman?! How is that possible?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>I'm surprised as well. Who would've thought...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>Ever since the destruction of the Alize people, none have appeared in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>What is going on? If that is true, word of this cannot be kept to our tribe alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>This is something that may very well shake the future of each tribe...of all of Saga itself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>Calm down. News of this has still not gone out to the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Father...I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>Destiny guides you. Very well...retire for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Oh! Please, wait! There is one thing I must tell you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>At the place where the Ritual of Baptism was held, I received another strange revelation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>Another strange revelation...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Yes! Most likely, what I saw was the not-so-distant future of Saga. It was a land burning in flames!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>Burning in flames...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>There I saw the tribes of Saga clashing with one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>The forest...the prairies...all of it was burning...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>And then...I saw something terrifying...something that I never thought could exist in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>What the...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>It was a dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>A single gigantic dragon...was crying out amidst the burning land!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>Are you saying that's the future of Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Yes...that's what I was told.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>A dragon! Could it be...the work of the Tehre?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>The Tehre, the earth shamans....I'm saying that it may be them who's behind it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>Right now, they are actively breeding and feeding dragons. They use Port Nahema to then ship them off to different countries!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>They are a greedy bunch who are willing to twist the laws of nature to wield those once-feared dragons as a business device!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>Elder...we are not certain of that yet. Do not rush to judge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>If this land were to become scorched earth, they would suffer the same damage we would. I doubt they would do something so self-destructive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>For starters, let's investigate the Tehre factionâ€™s movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Elder</td>
<td>Understood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>The once extinct power of the wind has once again appeared in this world. That may hold some deeper meaning...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>If so...that revelation you saw...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>The invasion of Gluttony...the bird of a wind shaman...and that revelation you saw...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adone</td>
<td>In any case, we must deliver a report to the Sprite Trio. Leave the rest to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Very well. Excuse me.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
