<td>What follows is a tale that I was sadly unable to include in my will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Though through your letters, I have seen who you truly are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Haa... haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ragged sighs spill from your mouth, only to be lost in the rain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>With my hand, I quell them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>———!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Your voiceless cry reaches me even beyond the grave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>———!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I know your name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yu...van.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>My name... is Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Sol?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm another blank, just like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The memories rewind, stop, and begin to play out once again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>A new interpretation, performed by new players; enacted anew in a playhouse, and invested with raw emotion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This closing tale of a saint shall be told upon a floodlit stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I think you got the wrong address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Phew! I've been riding the New Year's high for so long, half the year's gone and passed me by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I mean, look at this mess. We haven't even started alphabetizing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's not like us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Northern Pride: Archives (Present Day)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's not like either of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If it's worth doing, it's worth doing right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Sure, but that doesn't mean you have to break your back over it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What am I supposed to do? Lord Zain's, well... gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>On top of that, Captain Kudan's missing—and at any moment we could find ourselves in battle with Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>And through it all, our brave new Lord Commander Kanon was locked in valiant battle with pile after pile of paperwork.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Do you have to say it like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And now, having vanquished her foe, she's been tasked with conducting an inventory of the archives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ugh... If I see another flyleaf, I think I'm going to scream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Truly, the seat of Lord Commander is not for the faint of heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, stop it. I don't know how I'm going to do this, Othima. It's too much for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well, you've certainly got a lot of expectations to live up to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Throwing in the towel like this isn't splendid at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Captain Yauras, eh? She couldn't get back to the field fast enough. I'm sure it's just a coincidence we got stuck with all her busywork.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Someone clean up this mess! I can't stand such inefficiency!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And Captain Seida... She sure picked a convenient time for a trip back home, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ugh... I think I'm going to have a nervous breakdown!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Keep it together, airhead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>And Captain Kagura's gone on some sort of seaside adventure without a word of explanation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What's that all about, I wonder? Some sort of secret romantic tryst?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I doubt it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ahh, to be one of the lucky few blessed with love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Dear any gods who might be listening, please let this man crash and burn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oho!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Now this is a good find!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ahem! My dear Lord Commander Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Um... Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I present unto you this humble gift.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Is this... a journal? Whose could it be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Tut-tut. You're one of those people who reads the last page first, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>O-of course not! Lies and slander!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That's a terrible habit, you know. The anticipation is half the fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Don't judge me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Anyway, make sure you read this one from the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Fine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>It was written by Lord Commander Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It's his last will and testament.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>His... His what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>That doesn't make any sense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I'm sure all Lord Commanders must have something written down, just in case worse comes to worst...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>But to have written an entire will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Lord Zain fell suddenly in battle! Why would he have written a will like this in advance? He didn't have any reason to—unless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>That's why I'm not so sure this is actually a will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What do you mean? You're the one who told me it was his will in the first place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I'm not sure what else to call it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Honestly, I'm not even sure what to think of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>This burden seems too great for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I will be the tenth to take this seat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>So, like my predecessors before me, I must shoulder the weight of the Holy Guard's absolute justice. And yet, I fear it will be too much for me to bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I know not whom this record is meant for...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Only that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Come. The stage is set.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>My tale begins with a memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>It's time for the curtain to rise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Slothstein: Ruins (Memories)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Sorry to rain on your parade...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>But this is as far as you go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Well, well. Look who it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Sometimes you find what you're looking for when you stop to sniff the roses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>You don't give up easily, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>The pursuit of world peace does demand one's best efforts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I've got nothing to say to you. That's not going to change, no matter how many times you come calling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Then why do you insist on standing in my way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Because all that talk of world peace...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>It just rubs me the wrong way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Guess I brought this on myself, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Y'know, for intruding on your romantic rendezvous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Othima, we are on a mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>C'mon, cut the stoic act! I can tell you're blushing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Othima. Focus. Now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Fine, fine! Be a grouch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Well, now. What a pleasant surprise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Zain? This guy's got bad news written all over him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Identify yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Let's see if your bite matches your bark, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Guh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Please. I can see your every move long before you make it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>You're... predicting my attacks? Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>This seems as good a time as any to close the trap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Zain? Any idea where your lady love's gotten to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>She's not my "lady love"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>So you say, but if your cheeks get any redder, they'll catch fire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Silence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>He's right, you know. You are rather incandescent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Gwaaarrgghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Sorry, but I don't have the time to play around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Extraordinary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Oh, Zain. Ever the celebrity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Where have you been?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Seeing her lover surrounded by such a crowd, how's a lady to feel but jealous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I knew it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Do you truly consider me your... your lover?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Hmhm. Why don't you tell me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>You're...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>It's touching to see you so interested in Zain, but I'm afraid I don't like to share.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Have we met? That hood makes it hard to tell. You must be awfully shy, to wear it so low.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Kaya, the Crimson Dragon. Captain of the 2nd Regiment of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>It's not only Zain you've been stalking, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>This will be your first and last warning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Warn away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>You are not welcome here. Leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Whatever do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Enough. It's time we got down to business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Protect me, my love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>You heard her, lover boy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Stop encouraging him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Oh, fine. The vanguard's all yours...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Lord Commander!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>I suppose you can't be persuaded to stand aside?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Of course not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>The desire that is common to all people, to preserve peace and conquer evil; this is the creed of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>That is the absolute justice of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Our light shines upon all the land; from the highest mountains, to the ocean's depths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>And should any oppose this sacred sword...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Its radiance shall turn their shadow to light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Ahh, Zain. Tenth Lord Commander...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Embrace the light that guides the world!</td>
</tr>
