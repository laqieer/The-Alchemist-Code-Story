<td>Zweite Aqua Slash!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Phew, we managed to get them all. But why were there so many of them here in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Beats me... All I know is that we can't let them run around like this. They're already attacking the village nearby.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>As much as I'd like to get rid of them all right away, we can't let you get ahead of yourself and get killed by something in our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...My apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There's no need for you to apologize...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The monsters from our world are terrorizing the people of yours...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>They shouldn't be here, yet I can't even do anything to stop them... And I'm a princess... I'm pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>As Melty Melromarc, the successor to the throne of Melromarc and its second princess, please accept my sincerest apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You're a princess, Melty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yes, but due to certain circumstances back home, people are not so happy about that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see... With a fancy title like yours, I can only assume that you're in some family feud related to being the royal successor. I guess every family has its problems...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We should focus on more important issues right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We in the royal family must do everything in our power in the arduous fight against the Waves, but all I'm doing right now is running away from it all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Melty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But I feel tremendously better with Naofumi and the others by my side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And I'm sure Father will come to his senses once he listens to what we have to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But first I need to get Naofumi to speak with my mother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>With Mother...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What's wrong, Melty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What if I'm never able to return to my world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I can't even bear the thought of never seeing Father or Mother ever again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hey, where'd the determined girl from earlier disappear to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I don't blame her for feeling worried. She may be a princess, but she's also still just a young girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'll help you return home, Melty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'll need your help to do that, though. We want to protect our world, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Anastasia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(These people are no different than I am... They simply want to protect what's important to them.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Very well... I will do everything in my power to take care of the Wave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'll need to reunite with the others who were called to this world in order to so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(I hope that Naofumi is one of the others who got sent here...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We should go to a more populated area. We'll reach the village if we go straight down this path. Let's start with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wow... There's a lot more people here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This road is full of peddlers, and where there's merchants, there's a plethora of information that's being shared...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That hair... Is that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hey, you. Is your name Melty, by chance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh! How do you know my name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I met a guy earlier who was looking for someone, and the person he described happens to look a lot like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>How exactly did he describe her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Er... Said something about a girl with tanuki ears and another with wings on her back...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That must be Raphtalia and Filo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>He also mentioned a somewhat pompous indigo-haired girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Whâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's true that you do have indigo-colored hair...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The pompous part's not wrong, either...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I-I've never heard any man but Naofumi say anything so rude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Where did you see him?! Tell me at once! I will find him immediately!</td>
</tr>
