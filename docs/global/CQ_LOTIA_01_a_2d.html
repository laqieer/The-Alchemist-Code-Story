<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Mommy! Why are you helping that man?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>He tried to hit the critters and got bit! He got what he deserved! They're like family to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I know, sweetie. He might have deserved it, but our darlings have a very strong bite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It hurts very badly, and if the wound was left untreated, he would have died. I wasn't going to let that happen, sweetie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Not even to a bad man who tried to hurt our family?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No, sweetie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Listen to me, Lotiyah. You must treat those around you equally and with kindness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So long as you do, then surely...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I wanted to heed my mother's words and be kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hold it right there! Why did you feel the need to hurt these poor creatures so?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Why shouldn't I? It's not like they're human or nothin'. Besides, I had to get 'em before they got me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>And you don't complain about injuries sustained in the Colosseum. It's one of the rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I-I know that, but still...you went too far!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>These creatures are trained to not cause grievous injuries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>They do their best to put on a good show for the spectators! That's why—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Quit yer yappin'! I hate those damn creatures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The stars of the Colosseum are the gladiators! Get it? I'm a star! I don't have time to stand around listenin' to yer bellyachin'!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>How dare he! How dare he hurt my poor darlings like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It cannot be helped. The heroes of the Colosseum have always been the humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I realize that, but still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What about Zeno? He had already left by the time I came here, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh, he was wonderful. A truly remarkable person, that Zeno.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>He was a perfect gentleman to men and women, gladiators, trainers, and beasts alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Not only that, but his swordsmanship was incredible to behold. It never failed to captivate the audience. He truly left us too soon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>He sounds so wonderful—nothing at all like the rabble we have around here now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Gladiators these days don't show any respect to the beasts and turn their noses up at us trainers. They think everybody else is beneath them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Now, now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Look! He didn't even apologize for hurting my family like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Your...family? Lotiyah, you mustn't get too attached to these creatures. You're the one who will end up hurt if you do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Now, why don't we go have some cake to cheer ourselves up, hm? I heard a new shop opened up near here recently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oooh! Cake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I mean... Um, never mind. I don't really like cakes or sweets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Mmm...cake... I wish I'd asked where that new shop is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I really hope no one's figured out that I'm a sweet tooth. I hide it as best I can...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I don't want people thinking I'm soft. It's a male-dominated world out there, and people already underestimate me just because I'm a woman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Zeno, though... He treated everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of gender. He must've been a really great person...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>He was even polite to the trainers... It's hard to believe someone so wonderful could really exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I wish I could've met him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh! Come to think of it, didn't Zeno's little sister become a gladiator recently? I wonder...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oi! Lotiyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Look what your mangy beasts have done to me! I'm gonna have to opt out of the next match!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You again? Stop blaming my darlings for your inadequacies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The referee upheld the match, didn't they? Grraw didn't do anything wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Shut up! That mongrel made a fool of me and I'm really ticked off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Give 'er here! I'll teach her a lesson she'll never forget!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>No! Never!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You're the one who needs a lesson, you selfish pig!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You...! How dare you insult me! You're nothing but a lowly trainer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>T-Teona?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I was present at the match from beginning to end. Not once did the creature use excessive force in its attacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The proud beasts of the Colosseum fight fairly and with honor, in accordance with the rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Your anger is misplaced; Lotiyah is not deserving of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Wha—?! Well, if you ask me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>A troubled little girl who became a gladiator by riding her brother's glorified coattails should keep her ignorant opinions to herself!</td>
</tr>
