<td>Why?! Why did you let it get away?! We could have defeated the Demon Paragon here and now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Calm down, Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We wouldn't have been able to kill it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What do you mean? Were we not winning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We were. We inflicted mortal wounds over and over again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>And yet, we could not kill it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Weird, isn't it? It had nothing to do with toughness or vitality. It just can't be killed for some reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm not sure I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Thinking in circles isn't going to solve this. We were exhausted, and so we were lucky it decided to leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It will come for the castle again. That's when we'll settle this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It also mentioned some very curious things. We will have a talk later, Celis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes, I suppose we will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We also need to discuss countermeasures for the Demon Paragon. If it is alive, then we can kill it. There must be a way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>For now, let us go back to base and reorganize. It is about time for a meal, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But first, we'll need to dispose of the remaining enemy forces in the castle town. We can't allow any more people to get hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Can't be...killed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's impossible! I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Azami.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What's the matter, Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No, it's... It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Besides, it's the humans who tyrannically wielded their ideologies over us first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke. What exactly are demons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What are you saying all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I always thought of demons as simple monsters that hungered for human flesh. But the Hidden Ogres and Demon Paragon were not at all like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>They said it was for Wadatsumi's peace. I mean, of course I'm against letting demons take over this country, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It said...that it was humans that wielded their ideologies against them first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Do they hate humans the same way Azami hates them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Demons must be eradicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>But I... I don't know how to put this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I know what you're trying to say, but there are no answers to the question on your mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You're not really good at thinking in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But I'm serious aboutâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Let's go home. That's all we can do for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I...suppose so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>There is one among you who uses a strange art, am I correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You were the one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What does it all mean?</td>
