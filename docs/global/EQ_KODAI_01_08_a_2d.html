<td>But where did it even come from?! No pathogen has ever produced symptoms like this in any of the worlds I've observed before.</td>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yet more cases of this illness keep popping up, and the numbers are growing. How? Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>Claybelle! Food's ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Ah, wonderful! Perfect time for a break.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Tell Quence I'll be there as soon as I've tidied up the lab.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>Okey-doke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>You seem to have already gotten quite accustomed to having her around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>She's no different than a human child. I've cared for my fair share of those here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>My two disciples were just like her not too long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>For my own future reference, if I may ask: how long did it take for your disciples to fully mature?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Heh. The short answer is, they haven't! Zafeiris, humans don't just reach maturity one day, and then that's that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Seeing and experiencing many things over many years, they learn bit by bit who they truly are, and gradually achieve what others might consider to be adulthood. The line is not quite so sharp, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>It takes that long? But humans live such short lives! They'd barely have any life left by the time they finish growing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Ehh, you might be surprised. They have a saying: Even without parents to raise them, children will always grow up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>In other words, humans are always maturing on their own through self-discovery, without any outside meddling at all. For some, you might turn around one day and realize, they're an adult now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>But, I don't—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Have the luxury of time to let it happen naturally? You've always been a little impatient that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Do you remember that day we faced each other for the right to claim the title of Guardian Dragon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>You showed far too many opportunities for me to exploit, simply because you'd rush in recklessly at the most critical of moments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Ophioneus is on the move, and his forces will not rest until they've achieved his ends. Lil cannot afford to sit idle and wait for nature to take its course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Hmph. You know, a good friend would've taken a moment—just a moment!—to reminisce with me after hearing something like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>But, you're right, time is of the essence. So what do you plan to do now? Surely you don't intend to stay in this Stratum for long, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I'm...not certain. I must admit, I don't fully understand what Schmeier intended for Lil to accomplish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I've only been told of the final destination: the Genesis Altar. Ultimately, I must take Lil there. But I've been given no further instruc—</td>

<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>Lady Claybelle. Will you not reconsider your stance? It would be most beneficial, for you as well, if you simply give us what we demand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Does Ophioneus truly intend to destroy the Shell of the World?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Can he not spare but a moment to allow for the culmination of Schmeier's research? For us to make proper contact with Ouroboros?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>He cannot. We cannot. It is imperative we proceed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>But, why?! Why must you be so impetuous?! What are you afraid of?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>I think I can field that one. They want more than anything to start a war with Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>What? Is this true?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>Lady Claybelle, you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Why else would you put so much effort into the pursuit of Ouroboros' child form?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Ouroboros is the protective wall keeping this world held together, all while ridding it of hostile entities...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Hostile entities from outside, anyway. Everything she does is directed only outward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>If that child were to see and learn of all the sin in this world, and then reconnect with the Shell, Ouroboros would come to recognize the hostile entities that exist within it as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>And that's what you fear, isn't it? You feel threatened by the prospect of the Shell of the World willfully smiting those like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>I'll take that as a yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>If that's what you're all about, then there's absolutely no way I can ever let you have her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Enough blood is on our claws as it is. Countless lives, not even all dragon, have been lost under our watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I cannot permit any further losses solely under the auspices of...what, hiding your shame?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>The particulars of our grand design are irrelevant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>We must clear the way for our future! We will do everything in our power to put an end to your journey with her, no matter how much blood we must spill to do so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>That child—the soul of that abominable Shell—must never be permitted to encroach upon the Genesis Altar!</td>
