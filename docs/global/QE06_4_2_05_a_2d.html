<td>Using Alchemy, we could dive into this blade's...let's call it, Memory Realm, and summon Celis once we're inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That way, Celis could teach you her sword techniques in person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Wait. Do you really think that could work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I hope so. We don't have any other options left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>But we have no idea what using Alchemy like that might do to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I told you, there's no other way! Logi must learn Kagutsuchi, one way or another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...No matter the cost, huh? You do realize just how much strain this is liable to put on your body, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And you still wanna try it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...I do. For the sake of Wadatsumi. But only if Logi is also okay with it, given...his own connections that will come into play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Receiving direct instruction from Celis will mean coming face-to-face with her... Talking to her. Are you ready for that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I thought I should ask, because...I'm not sure I would be, if I were in your place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>To be honest, I don't know how ready I am. But if I don't do this now, I'll never master the art of Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Besides, you're proposing this at your own peril, and you're doing it to honor her wishes, aren't you? For Mother...and for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm fully prepared to learn the sacred art, of course. But what I'm not as certain of is whether or not if I'm ready to know her will...to inherit her wishes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But you already saw the past, right? So you already know all about that stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I did. And...I understand, sure. But understanding the events is not the same as inheriting the will behind them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I need to be able to experience it. To feel it. Only then will I be able to carry out those wishes, and wield this power. And only when I'm doing it will I know whether or not I'm ready for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Does that mean you're in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yeah. Let's do this, Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Thank you, Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Dear Celis... I know that even in death, you still think of Wadatsumi. Believe in your wishes. Believe in your son's wishes. Let your memory guide you here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The air! Something's happening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's just like when we dove into Mikaboshi's consciousness. Except this time, we're forcibly interfering with the object's memories through Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This stands to be a lot rougher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There's a power pushing back against this unnatural intrusion against causality. It feels like it's trying to force me out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But we can't give up! No matter how much the world tries to correct itself, I will keep grinding away...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...until we break through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I will unravel the thoughts and emotions hidden within this object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Connect with us! In the here and now!</td>
