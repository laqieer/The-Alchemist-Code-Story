<td>HYAAAAH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's okay now, Celliers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh... S-sorry. I couldn't do anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Don't sweat it! I know you're no good with bugs. Leave the extermination to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Thank you...and sorry, really. I like butterflies now, but this is just too much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>S-stop... Stay away...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>N-no... I don't want to do that anymore. Please, don't make me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...So it couldn't nullify the curse this time either, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Clearly its life energy is amplifying the anti-curse properties of the crystal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...Won't its mind shatter if we keep this up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We'll just have to make sure it doesn't, now won't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That is the only subject who fused with the crystal, acquiring the power of crystallization. We must yield results at all costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Even so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If there's any possibility of it gaining the power to repel Asmodeus' curse, then we must do all we can, inhuman or otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Now then, prepare for the next experiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Y-yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yeek! P-please, no more...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I don't want to do this to you, but...the cost of refusing is too high.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>O-oh... Ahh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wh-what in the—?! My body, it's—NNGAAAAAAHHH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Celliers! Celliers?! What have you done?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It turned a human into crystal...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We'll be in trouble if that power's turned on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes, we must drill into him the cost of rebellion. Deep into his flesh, if need be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ho ho... Oh, Celliers, my dear, cute Celliers. I'll teach you some manners...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...! Ah, ahhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You okay, Celliers? You're white as a sheet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>*Huff* *huff* M-Mielikki...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's okay, no more bugs! I squashed them all like, uh, bugs. So you're safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Everything here's been crystallized...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>*Whew* Th-thanks...and sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Don't worry about it! Everyone's got their Achilles' heel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>My mom used to say that, instead of making yourself do things you're bad at, focus on what you're good at!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...So you have things you're bad at, Mielikki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Uhh, guys, maybe? Not the villagers, though, they're nice. Strangers are kinda scary, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...I'm a guy, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Celliers is a Celliers, that's what I know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Uh, sure... Heh heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh! You smiled, Celliers! That's great to see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...Talking to you soothed me somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Thanks, Mielikki. Having you around keeps me calm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Really? Heh heh, happy to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>In that case, you oughta have me around all the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I love seeing you smile myself!</td>
