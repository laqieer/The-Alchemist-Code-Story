<td>001</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>There we go. All finished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Sorry, Emmel. In the end, I was the one who needed to be saved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah. I think I may have overdone it by equipping the Engineer Solder with the boosters...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Perhaps so, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Anyhow, we've gotta get back to Nimul and the others. How do we get back up there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh? Did the wall collapse in the fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It seems like it did. Also, do you hear that voice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>—eeeeey, is anyone—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That voice? It can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Adaleigh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's Icona! That's Icona's voice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's gotta be her! Let's go, Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Icona!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Is that you, Adaleigh? Perfect! The cavalry has arrived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh? Why are you locked up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's a long story! Oh, Emmy's here too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Y-yes! Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm A-OK! How about you guys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Are you two hurt? No, that's no good! Let's get you properly patched up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You can tell?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Of course! This mechanical eye here can detect magil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I can tell just by looking, so I knew all along. Even about what's inside of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh? Wh-what are you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Can we discuss this later?! Damn, where's the key?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Adaleigh, you're still living in the fast lane. It works out for me this time, since I'm in a hurry too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean you're in a hurry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ahh! Another earthquake?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>There's no time! Adaleigh, you've got to get me out of here right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What're you talking about? Why are you in such a rush?! Tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You can be so dense sometimes! It's the Cursed Beast, okay? It's waking up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I've gotta seize this opportunity before it disappears! I've gotta make observations, get some data!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wait, did you say that Belphegor is waking up? But that's never—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's true! Trust me, Adaleigh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Urk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Belphegor has entered an active phase. If nothing is done, then it's sure to wreak havoc on this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But I can stop it. No one else can, but I have the ability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Will you trust me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If we move now, there's still time. So let me out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Fine! I got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hold it, Adaleigh. You mustn't release her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Long time no see, Minny! Um. What's this about not letting me out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The body of a member of the inspection team was discovered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>He was attacked. Murdered. And it happened over a week ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Strange, isn't it? According to what Adaleigh said, you were just recently in Redington.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Your involvement with the inspection team is a lie. That transmission that Adaleigh heard... You were behind it, weren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Aren't you a smart cookie? Guess that's only to be expected of Mayor Fedele's son.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Why did you do all of this, Icona? Answer me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Emmel! Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Nimul? What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>We don't really know either, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Someone has been working to awaken the Cursed Beast sleeping here. We can't let that happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What? Icona...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What are you talking about, Minario? This is just a joke, right? Lower your gun, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Stay back, Adaleigh. This woman is no longer the Icona you once knew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What are you talking about, Minario?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You remember when I said that the number of Fallen has been increasing recently, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Don't tell me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It was her. She orchestrated the illegal mining operations, tricking the miners and forcing them into contact with the Cursed Beast's corruption. It was all her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Icona, you called the miners down here as bait for Belphegor, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Minario, you're a proper search dog, aren't you? I bet you've been sniffing me out like the mutt you are for ages!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Icona, why? How could you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Wow. That's a tough question. If I was forced to answer, I guess I'd have to say I'm doing this because it was necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Necessary? It was necessary to wake up the Cursed Beast?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'm glad you asked! I figured it out, y'know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I figured out how to control the Cursed Beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Control the Cursed Beast? Have you lost it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Now that's something I can't answer with confidence. I might not be sane. Even I have moments where I wonder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>However, I'm sure that I'm close to the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Isn't sin something that originates from humankind? If it is, we should be able to control it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>By using logic to understand and analyze, we can control anything in the universe. That is the foundation of magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Think about it: if we can do it with other things, why couldn't we repurpose the Cursed Beasts for our own goals?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Nonsense. It does not matter that the magil of the Cursed Beasts is made of our sins. The scope of our existence is much too different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>The consistent energy needed to bind that much magil doesn't exist in this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I'm surprised to hear that from you, of all people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You're the ones who gave me the idea. You're the Sephira, and she... She is the Vessel of Purification, who has a Cursed Beast sealed within herself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>That's right! I don't need to worry about having enough energy to seal the Cursed Beasts if I have a vessel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You're so so so very fascinating! How can a Cursed Beast be crammed into such a tiny package?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Stop it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Truly, even I couldn't have imagined something so ingenious. The core of the Cursed Beast is sealed inside of you, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Stop it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>The core of the Cursed Beast is...inside of Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You never noticed? The Vessel of Purification is just a container to stash the cores of the Cursed Beasts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>How do you know this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>That is a secret passed down only to the druidic priestesses of Sephira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Emmel is a container for the Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>That means we didn't defeat Asmodeus, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>And you knew this, Emmel? You knew?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Nimul, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Well, well. The secret's out! Anyhow, I was planning to use the Cursed Beast to discover new innovations in the use of magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>That's why my colleague got pretty angry. I expect he'll change his mind if it turns out to be a success, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>So if you don't mind, I'd like to get back to my lab as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>We're racing against time here, okay? Belphegor's gonna wake up soon, and he's gonna be grouchy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You guys get it, don't you? There's really no time left, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Could you hand Emmy over to me so I can work on my experiments?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Oh well. Can't say I didn't try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Gah! We're surrounded?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Like Minny said, that transmission was staged. Obviously, this whole setup was a trap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Everything was calculated... You knew that if you went missing, Adaleigh would look for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Of course! Wasn't it a clever plan? Really caught you off your guard, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Adaleigh believed in you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>How could you do this to him?! What is he to you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>He's family, of course. Your point?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>You're insane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I'll take that as a compliment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I can't imagine how you feel or what you're thinking right now, so either way—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Take the path that you won't regret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>It's fine for you to stand up for yourself or to turn and run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>You could even choose to side with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Just commit to whatever you do. Making a half-hearted choice will only result in more misfortune.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I will stop you, Icona!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Even though I'm probably the only one who could really control the Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>A lot of people will surely suffer if we do things your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>This isn't what I built that airship for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>There it is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>That determination on your face... Your heart and mind set only on this one task... For once, your eyes are not veering away to anything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Good, Adaleigh. That's perfect. That's what makes you a true child of this region!</td>
</tr>
