<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Is this all the soldiers we have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. We have sent dispatches to every location in which we have allies, but we can't count on any of them arriving in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Then we must make this work with the numbers we do have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We of the Gluttony Foss Liberation Army will spare no effort to help the people of the desert in this, the hour of their need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Neither will the Blue Tongues... Or, that's what I'd like to say, but we can't get in contact with our main force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It seems that shortly before the Jam started appearing in great numbers, there were a few who witnessed the Blue Tongues fighting something, but the details are unclear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Mocca was with them, wasn't she? I really wish we could go look for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but we don't have the time. The scouts' reports show that the Gluttony army has already crossed the border and entered the Desert Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>They'll likely arrive here by tomorrow. We need to make sure we're ready by then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>All right. I'm not worried, though. The Blue Tongues have won a lot of battles, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm sure they're fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>First, we will need to evacuate the people of this city to a town deep in the middle of the Desert Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The Fruit Peddlers can handle that. I'll have them help carry supplies and guide people to safety. I'd like to evacuate all the civilians from the area at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Um... Does that include me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If at all possible. Depending on how things turn out, you could end up being something of a chink in our armor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's all right. Everyone here is an ally, a friend. No one will hurt you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I know that. It's just... I feel so useless. I'm the only one who isn't helping.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You might not be standing with us on the front lines, but that doesn't mean you can't help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We need logistic support, supplies... Once the battle breaks out, we'll begin sending the severely wounded your way to get patched up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Even those who don't fight on the battlefield still have a war to win, you know. It's people like you who will do battle with death itself to save every life that you possibly can from its clutches. I want you to remember that, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I-I will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What will we do about guards? This city is little more than a marketplace with an oasis at its center.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>There are no ramparts, and no moat—we might as well be naked, we are so utterly defenseless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Don't worry. I have an idea. If all goes well, we'll find ourselves in quite an advantageous position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ceclidis is indeed a man to be feared, but he cannot neglect his instinct for self-preservation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's how we'll get him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Onward! Our King wishes us to restore this land to its rightful place as part of the territory of Gluttony Foss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The black tide will open up our path! Lay waste to everything that stands in your way, and plunder whatever your heart desires!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huzzzaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Reporting! The Gluttony army is now passing through the streets that were swallowed up by the Jam! Their number is estimated to be three times our own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It will take a force that size some time to reach us. I'd say we have about half a day at best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Is Ceclidis present among the troops?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Negative! The army is being led by one of the nobles aligned with Cecildis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I didn't think he would be. Excellent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Indeed. It seems that our plan is fit to go as it is—in which case, I suppose I must now finish attending to the preparations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It looks like it's going to be a long day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You know what to do—just follow the plan. I leave the preparations in the city to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>In the meantime, it's up to us to kill every last one of those creatures—those monsters lingering outside the city!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We will need to do this fast, so keep your wits about you, all of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Over there! There's a horde of monsters in the shadow of that dune!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Gotcha. I'll head over there right away, but...do you really think this plan will work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Who can say for sure? Right now, all we can do is give it everything we've got!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You're right... Let's go!</td>
</tr>
