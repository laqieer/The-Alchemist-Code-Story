<td>Hey, how are things going here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Director Vincent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Sorry I'm late. Had a little trouble finding the store I had to go to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'll take care of the rest. You guys go back to your posts. Rehearsals for the ceremony will begin soon</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Peacekeepers! They arrived quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yup. I called for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I was suspicious that this guy was up to something. I was doing my job, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>To be honest, I felt like I wasn't being as helpful a I could have been. We owe our gratitude for Estella.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ugh… The job of a director is not easy. I can't wait for you to take over, Amis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Dammit! What you're doing is wrong. To promote a magic using weakling as the next director? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What are you talking about? You're the one that's a weakling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You're thinking of ruining the unveiling and the event because of your own vanity and self-interest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You don't deserve to sit alongside hardworking engineers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Get it straight. It doesn't matter whether she can use magic or not. I selected someone who is passionate about magic and machines as the next director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That giant hunk of metal is to pave the way of the future. I'll do what I can to make that come true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That kind of determination is necessary for the future of mechanical engineering and as a director of the Central Technology Bureau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Director Vincent…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Besides, Amis can do troublesome work flawlessly. She's the perfect successor for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>As I've explained myself, go for it, Amis. Make sure there are no more problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Not the most honest explanation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes… Really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There are so many people here. So, what's the ceremony about? What's going to happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>They're unveiling some new machine. Something that's supposed to change the face of mechanical engineering, they say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>And also the inauguration of the new director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And now everyone, a speech from the newly appointed director, Amis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm the newly appointed director Amis. For a long time, I've devoted myself to the development of the Magitek Train.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I may not have had a lot of experience, but my colleagues and others have supported me for this dream to become a reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>With their help, I'm now ready to unveil this train for everyone here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>With the construction of rails, the train will be able to travel everywhere. The possibilities are endless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The Magitek Train… It is my dream. It's only just begun. My next goal is to make flying transport.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>To create a machine to transport people in the air without the aid of magic. This is the future that I imagine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'll continue to put my work into mechanical and magic engineering for the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This will be the goal of the new director of the Central Technology Bureau… My goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We're so far away. Can we even see it from here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes, I'm sure. You'll see something dazzling and beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Is that right? Then that's good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I should thank you. You've really supported them with their work. Thank you very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I don't understand. I came to this city just for a short time to do fortune telling for people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But, I met a number of people that I wanted to support and help, because they were willing to work at improving themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>She made sure to work hard for the future. I only gave her a little advice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No matter how hard someone works, they might not know which direction to go. Like the direction for the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It's because of your help by supporting her that she is able to smile like that. Your powers did that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You're right. If that's the case…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I know why my mother loved doing this for people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Are you going to leave the city soon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yes. To go somewhere that my powers would be needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I see… Then there is one last fortune telling request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>About the future of mechanical engineering…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Magical engineering can benefit everyone, but the evolution of machines has its drawbacks. So I'm concerned about this train…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>And finally, the train will move across these rails. Is everyone ready?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>With rails, the train can go anywhere? Isn't that amazing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>But can that giant metal thing really move?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Let's see… A massive power will appear. Sooner or later, the machines of this land may run into great difficulties…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Even so, she and her subordinates who put so much into the train will not give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>They will stand up again and again for their dreams and goals, and change the negative fortune telling readings with their efforts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>And so…there's no reason to worry.</td>
</tr>
