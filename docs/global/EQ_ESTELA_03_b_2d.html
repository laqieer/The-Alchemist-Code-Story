</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>I should thank you. You've really supported them with their work. Thank you very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>I don't understand. I came to this city just for a short time to do fortune telling for people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>But, I met a number of people that I wanted to support and help, because they were willing to work at improving themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>No matter how hard someone works, they might not know which direction to go. Like the direction for the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>It's because of your help by supporting her that she is able to smile like that. Your powers did that.</td>

<tr>

<td>I know why my mother loved doing this for people.</td>

<td>About the future of mechanical engineering…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Elder</td>
<td>Magical engineering can benefit everyone, but the evolution of machines has its drawbacks. So I'm concerned about this train…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chairman</td>
<td>And finally, the train will move across these rails. Is everyone ready?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>With rails, the train can go anywhere? Isn't that amazing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>But can that giant metal thing really move?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>Let's see… A massive power will appear. Sooner or later, the machines of this land may run into great difficulties…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>Even so, she and her subordinates who put so much into the train will not give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>They will stand up again and again for their dreams and goals, and change the negative fortune telling readings with their efforts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Estella</td>
<td>And so…there's no reason to worry.</td>
