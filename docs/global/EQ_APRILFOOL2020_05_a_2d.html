<td>Where... am I? It looks like there's a school over there, but... Wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Is that... It can't be... the Tower of Babel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>How'd I know the name of that tower, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You've seen this place before. It looks just like the world from ■■■.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>This grand library is the pride of ■■■ Academy, and all students are welcome to peruse its shelves. I would think this is your best bet for relevant information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yeah, it's time for me to get to work! Hey—why don't you come lend me a hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I-if you give me something to eat... I'll consider letting you meet Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>However, know this: So long as we don't forget about the things we've lost, I believe we will always find our way back to them—or them to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We might miss them for a time, but we can be reunited with them again. Something to keep in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Because if you do... you'll never remember. You'll lose those memories forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The life I'm leading here is really fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But... is that what I wanted? What was I looking for, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No... It was something else. It had nothing to do with this academy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>When you need me, just wait for me there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The place where we first met.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's it—the promise! I just remembered! I did have someone with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Kaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>On a whim, you decide to follow one of the steps of a half-remembered legend, that someone you can't recall once told you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And cry out that girl's name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>About time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Are you enjoying your life here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Here, in this world, created by your own desires? There were two: Firstly, to improve your beloved TAC; secondly, to spend time with your favorite TAC characters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I... I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>However, the more you grew to love this world, the more you forgot about your own, and the more you forgot about your beloved TAC.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Why did you disappear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well... Every time I grew to like you a little more, I learned a little more about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Perhaps for most people things would have ended there—but I'm not most people. I'm the archaeology club's prodigy. So I continued the investigation for you, and... this is the result.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I know what TAC is now. I've figured out how this world functions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And after learning that... I couldn't bring myself to meddle in your affairs any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Kaya...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So that's why I'm here. It's really not like me to do something like this at all, but... I've been waiting for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Come. It's time to unravel the history you've made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Does that mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You've made it this far. This is the last step you need to take.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Aaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Don't worry. You can prevail. You've won battles like this many times before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Is that a... demon? Yeah... It is! I remember now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You do? Then you recall the world you once held so dear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If you start prying into that world's secrets, you're sure to encounter these creatures along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I know... They're a troublesome enemy, but not an impossible one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Precisely. Perhaps we'd better let loose, then?</td>
</tr>
