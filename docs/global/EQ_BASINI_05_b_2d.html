<td>Excalibur... It's growing brighter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>For all the friends I've lost... For all the oaths I've sworn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>For all the world's creatures who seek salvation in order...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>By the power of light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>By the power of darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Gnrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>To think they would master the power of compassion to such a degree...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, no matter. They have merely prolonged the inevitable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Run all they like, they cannot elude me forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Thank you, Carlotta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>He can't follow us this far. We should be safe here for a little while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Irene, I need to thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No, you don't. I did only as my resolve bid me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What happened to your blindfold?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That was part of Corpse's uniform. I no longer have need of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Are you certain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I am. I've decided this for myself, for the sake of order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What will you do now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I will fight to defend the order of Babel in my own way, following my own resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Now that I have you as my guiding light, I won't run any more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Human resolve can make a paradise or a wasteland of this world. Balancing it is the only way to ensure order in a world of light and darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If I have to bloody my hands beyond the reach of light to preserve that balance, so be it. That is my resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>And what about you? You cannot run from Waginau forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Just watch me. I'll run fast enough to save the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You truly have changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I have a lot more responsibilities to bear nowadays.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Then I will go my own way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Running away never was your style.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Will you miss me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>And here I thought you didn't know how to make a joke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Swear to me that you'll keep Excalibur safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Of course I will. I've gotten used to keeping my oaths by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Well then... See you around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>May we meet again someday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I hope so too, although I'm not sure if that day will ever come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>All of this means nothing before the absolution of order, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Now then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's time I started running. I've got a world to save.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>For the sake of the light, I go into darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>And so the Lord Commander took Excalibur and vanished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Within days, the news had spread across the entirety of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Did you hear?! It's Basheeny! He's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Up and left, eh? So I've heard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I wonder where he's gotten to now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Can't the two of you look a little more alarmed?! Do you have any idea what the Lord Commander's disappearance will mean for Babel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Nothing good, I guess. But I've got a feeling it'll work out in the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Bud!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Remember, Basheeny swore to protect Babel just like the rest of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>He hasn't run away. I guarantee it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Whatever he's up to, he's doing it for the good of all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Well, can't let him get ahead of us. Up for some sparring, Victor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You two! Honestly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Although... Maybe you're right. We have to have faith in him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Basheeny, wherever you are... I believe in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>And so the Holy Sword Excalibur vanished from the pages of history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Behind its disappearance, unbeknownst to all, lay the unwavering conviction of Basheeny, the twelfth Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>His determination to defend the law and order of the world lent him the strength to endure his disgrace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>In order to realize the justice with which he had been entrusted, he plunged deeper and deeper into darkness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>There to lie, until the day that light shone once more in the abyss.</td>
