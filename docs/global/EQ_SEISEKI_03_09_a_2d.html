<td>Captain Kudansteinâ€”once the youngest knight to become a captain in the Holy Guard...I am honored that you know my name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Do you understand what it is that you're doing? This is Gluttony!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Am I to assume that you, the emperor, have stepped into this country unannounced in search of the Sacred Stone, without utilizing any diplomatic channels?! Are you trying to start a war?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>War? Hehe. That's not a bad idea either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>However, unfortunately, I am not interested in that form of simplistic war...just as you are not interested in justice without power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hm. Perhaps this is fate. How about it, Kudanstein? Would you serve me with your lance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What kind of nonsense are you spewing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's not nonsense. I respect your abilities. Please, use that spear of yours to serve under me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I will never serve you nor will I serve Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If you get caught up in the trivialities, you'll overlook the big picture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Whether it be Wadatsumi or Zangetsu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? I respect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I respect your ability to survive that fierce battle at Wadatsumi...and your mental strength to maintain your sanity even in Zangetsu that was out of our control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>More importantly, I respect your purity in your pursuit of power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You are, by no means, a man whose career will end as captain of a small regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You are a chosen knight with the ability to change the world...if you set your mind to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Abhorrent emotions such as hate, jealousy, and betrayal... swirl throughout this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No matter how much the spear of justice was to take a stab at these, they will never disappear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I am certain that deep inside you feel emptiness...and a strong emotion resembling hatred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Such trivial justices such as love and bonds are not enough to truly unite this world. Absolute power is what is needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I have the ability to make you pursue that power, to remove other such trivialities from you. This absolute power will be enough to take over the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>How about it, Kudanstein? Would you like to change the world with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Change the world...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes. Powerless justice is useless. What you need is justice that is accompanied by power...the power to change the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This sensation...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Kudan, please don't tell me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Let's hurry! If we don't get there soon, it may be too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Seriously! I'm hurrying! Don't bother me!</td>
