<td>A few weeks after the first mission...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Shion! You're hurt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Your clothes... They're torn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm fine. It's nothing serious. You should have seen the other person...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Asuka brings out bandages and medicine and begins treating Shion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Shion, it pains me whenever I see you like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I know the nature of your work, but still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Don't say that. I know full well the path I walk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It was never your fault to begin with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I was born a son out of wedlock between a Greed Dike nobleman and the only daughter of a noble family from Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Even back then, Greed Dike and Wadatsumi were hardly ever on good terms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Since my earliest memories, I was subject to nothing but barely veiled hatred and derision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My very existence tainted the pure lineage of both families, and the truth of my ill-kept secret was banned from polite discourse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Mother was sent back in shame to Wadatsumi. She avoided being cast out of the family altogether on account of being the only child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Mother was the only one who loved me, and she paid no heed to the vehement objections from everyone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A short while later, she was betrothed to another Wadatsumi noble in an attempt to sweep the scandal from public memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That was when Asuka, my half-sister, was born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Her pedigree this time was assured, and heirdom of the house was bequeathed to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>As for me... it was decided that I would be raised as a girl, so that none could contest the authenticity of a female—but pureblooded—heir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Once more. And don't mess up again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>One, two, three, four...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Five, six... seven, eight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>[Dancing in these weird shoes is hard...]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...Ouch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Sigh... I don't know what Milord is thinking, asking me to teach a boy how to dance like a courtesan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Focus on your footwork, girl! Remember, you're a woman now. Don't let me catch you stomping around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Y-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I was groomed to be a retainer for Asuka. Being "female" meant I could accompany her everywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The more Asuka grew, the more she resembled Mother—in her looks, her personality, her gentleness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>For her sake, I trained hard day and night. I would endure anything to keep my beloved sister safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Even when Zheng Yi extended his protection to us, I made sure Asuka never had to face monsters in human skin up close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...This man, huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You seem acquainted with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Men like him are the reason I would never allow Asuka to go unaccompanied.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Mm. Do not worry. I share your sentiments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Well, I shall take my leave. He won't wait forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Make good on your word and take care of her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Of course. As they say... a man's word is his bond.</td>
