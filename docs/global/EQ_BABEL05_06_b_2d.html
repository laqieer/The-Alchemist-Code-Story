<td>This isn't what I learned Alchemy for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Enough already! Let's get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Don't be a fool! If we fail this mission, we'll be the ones getting terminated!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The activation key for Slothstein was lost, but the Wratharis key, the key for this place, is still in our hands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We should be able to bring down Magnus with the Demonic Soldiers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Then we can have him take all the blame! Their activation, the destruction of the ancient stone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It was all his doing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm not a fan of that idea... Particularly the part about bringing me down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Magnus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Just because you're having trouble taking me out, doesn't mean you get to blame all the rest of your troubles on me, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>To tell you the truth, though, it'd help me out a lot if you did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You...! What are you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>There's a way out in that direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Get out of here, and go write up your reports.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Make it clear that "It's all Magnus' fault," if you like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Haaa...haaa...haaa... You still alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Barely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm out of ammo, and my gadgets are all busted up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I said, I'm losing face here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Meeting him will get you involved. Knowing too much will make you a target.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>He's not worth all the trouble, you know. As far as company goes, he leaves a lot to be desired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Isn't there anyone who you would want to meet, regardless of what should happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>There is, isn't there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Who, me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Isn't that why you're so bullheaded in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Because you owe it to just such a person?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>All right. Yeah, there is someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm going to do as I please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I will go to him, even if he doesn't want me to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What's—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Rrroooohh... Grraaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Demonic Soldiers! How are there so many left?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We've got nothing left to fight them with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Could this place have been a factory for building Demonic Soldiers? If not...perhaps a depository for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Are you saying there could be even more of these things?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Heh! This could get interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Grroooooohhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No...! I don't want to—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What's that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The ceiling collapsed. I can't believe our luck. It blocked off their path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Who the hell could've done this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Who's there? I can't see anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Nobody special, here. Nobody you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Sorry to startle you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'll take care of things here. You should get yourselves out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What about you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'll just be taking out the trash.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That man...is fighting. Just on the other side of this wall...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>We're leaving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>He's right there... Fighting... Alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You know him, don't you? The one who spoke? Are you just going to leave him behind? Are you okay with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You're lying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Albea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>He's... It's him, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>That's none of your concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>That man... He's my brother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Don't be—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Magnus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Albea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I...! I don't remember much, but I do remember!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>When I was little, you made a doll move for me, didn't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Dang it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I was such a sloppy kid, but you'd clean up for me when I made a mess, wouldn't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I don't remember everything, but I do remember!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Magnus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Haa...haa...haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Magnus!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Heh... Hahaha! None of that rings a bell. You must have me mistaken for somebody else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>There's no mistake! Let me fight with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>This is my game to play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>M-Mira! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Albea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Stop him! Please! Stop my brother from...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Albea, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You can go through walls, can't you? Won't you do something? Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Arghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You understand, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I know you've been watching... Observing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>You know who you should be protecting right now—and it isn't me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>There you go again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>How can you be smiling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I want you to see my hair! It's pink, just like yours! I've taken such good care of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Mira! Tell me that it's the same! Tell me that he and I have the same hair color!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Yes... The very same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Urgh! Nngh... Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Magnus! I've made us a home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I've turned father's workshop into a real mechanic's repair shop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>And Father... Father's... Father's dead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I'm all alone now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>So... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Please... Please, Magnus! Let me see you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>All I want is for you to live your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Magnus?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Yeah... I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I'm counting on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Just so you know, I don't really care for gambling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Watching you win it all and lose it all, all over again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>That was what I loved the most.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I won't let anything get in the way of your last big wager.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Heh. Who knew I had such a good friend all along?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I just figure this friendship is worth all the trouble it causes me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>You're gonna make me blush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>So don't you lose, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Hahaha! You better not be praying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>You know I never lose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Magnus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I gave my little sister a present once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>It was the first Alchemy I ever used as a Paladin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I imbued my uniform with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>That coat...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I hope you know that it came from the bottom of my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Magnus! Magnus, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>You should forget about me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I'm nothing but a bundle of lies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Don't think for a second that I'm the type to sacrifice myself for others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>If your fate's already sealed, then there's only one thing you can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Go all in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I'm betting my life...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>...in one final burst to win it all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Magnus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Albea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Magnus! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>I was bluffing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Even though I was out of chips, I kept up the pretense of winning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>With warped powers at my fingertips, I kept toeing the line that I was never meant to cross.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>My eyes were fixed on a broken clock...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>But the hands are finally moving again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Albea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>You're the one who fixed it up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>You even took over our rotten father's shop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>I'm proud of you.</td>
</tr>
