<td>T-take some responsibility!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm telling you, Nyx isn't quite at that age yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Gimme a break...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's not what I'm saying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Activating our technique without setting a time or precise coordinates thrust the state of the world into chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Mira and I are from the continent of Babel. Hiiragi's from the...land of Zipangu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Almace and Titania are from a place called Tilhelm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And I think we're all currently in Babel, judging by the surrounding terrain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This world, though... The places and environs here are different from the ones we know. Maybe we've even come to a different time series.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Of course, this situation was entirely our doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But we can just remove the indefinite elements and try activating the technique again! I'm sure we'll be able to go home that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Indefinite...elements?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Perhaps you are referring to that enormous opponent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Can you explain? When you say you think we'll be able to go home, do you mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I shall explain, but later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Neither of our swords were capable of delivering a fatal blow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It was as if there was something blocking our attacks... Some kind of fog or sound barrier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tch! We don't have time to sit around talking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Almace... You are wounded. You must rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This is nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Whatever that thing is... It's definitely a kind of monster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Quick question! What kind of monster?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well... Back in my world, monsters are the source of all calamity, and it is the duty of kunoichi such as myself to defeat them. It seems to me that the monster who chased me was from my world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You fight those things?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Only the kunoichi have the power to take down the monsters. Like it or not, it's something I have to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh! Hmm... The powers of a kunoichi. So that's why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Nyx? What're you muttering about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Nothing. Never mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So you believe that creature is from your world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes, but...I've never encountered a monster impervious to so many attacks before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It might not be a monster from my world... Not exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Nyx?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We don't have time to think about this right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Can't you hear that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ooooooooraaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I knew it. That thing sure is persistent...and loud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This is bad! The city...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Step aside! I'll handleâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Almace, you mustn't! Your wounds haven't healed over yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ah! Time has stopped again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Mira, did you hear that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>It's giving me a headache!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Is that all you have to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Is there something else I should be focusing on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I guess this works out better anyway... I'm the only guy here, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Haa... Fine. Guess it's up to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Nyx...? Do you have an idea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Um... N-Nyx?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Mira. That was no misunderstanding earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hiiragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Y-yes...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I love you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What the...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I love you, Hiiragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Y-you... You... Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>From the moment I saw you, I thought you were great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Nyx?! What the hell?! What are you saying?! You're not making any sense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'm confessing my love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I can see that! But why?! Why did you stop time for this?! Why are you confessing?! What feelings could you possibly have to confess?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I don't want to hear it. I'm in love, Mira. I've fallen for Hiiragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Whaaat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>L-l-l-l...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I think you might have frozen Hiiragi as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Seriously, Nyx, what the hell is wrong with you?! Did the long journey do something to your head?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Sorry, sis. Didn't mean to make you jealous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I mean... I've never really looked at you that way before, sis, but...maybe this love I feel for you is something more than brotherly affection?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Nonononononononononononononononononononononononono... No way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'll straight up disown you! This is... Urgh! B-besides, weren't you just talking about how you're in love with Hiiragi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'm just not sure that I can contain this love within myself anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>C-contain it! Contain yourself, damnit! I can't believe this... My brother's turned into some kind of space-time-manipulating playboy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>H-hey! Vomit up your heart for all I care, but do it later! We need help over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I am not sure it would be wise for him to regurgitate his vital organs at any stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>It was a figure of speech, Tinnie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Right. My apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>We need to do something about this monster!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You're really brave, aren't you, Almace? I like that about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You watch your mouth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>My brother is a cheating pervert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I guess you can't have it all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Tch! You'll be lucky if you don't get my fist in your face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You're so honest. It's...bewitching. It makes me want to do everything and anything I can to make you fall for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I don't need a disloyal dog like you slavering after me. Go bother one of the other two girls you just confessed to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Is that really for the best?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>And why not?! Well, this is neither the time nor the place to be fooling around like this, but what else am I meant to say?! I'm not interested!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>He's my little brother, for crying out loud!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>This is no time to be deliberating, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ooooooooraaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>My observation and analysis are concluded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Our Chance Encounter was incomplete, resulting in a mix-up of various elements from various worlds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>That enemy was probably something like a by-product of the process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>A by-product?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>A mass of impure thoughts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>It's embarrassing to admit this, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>It looks like my, er, lovey-doveyness earlier was just that. It's like the Encounter caused all those feelings inside me to just...condense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>N-Nyx...?! But you've never showed any signs of...of...of that before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I guess I must've started feeling that way about you...without even being conscious of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>E-enough! I don't want to hear you talk about this ever again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>That, and... Actually, maybe it was love at first sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I-I've got things to take care of! Important things! I don't have time to be fooling around like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Besides, why would I want anything to do with you?! Where's your sense of loyalty?! Of devotion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I thought I'd found love, but now I'm not sure who I love, and I feel like I'm losing myself to these feelings!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Nyx... Did you hit your head on the way here or something? You're acting really weird.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>It's this love... It's driving me insane. I'm lovesick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>This is bad! This is really, really bad! My brother needs serious help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I'm a love hunter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>If he can resolve his feelings, perhaps we might be able to make some breakthrough here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Fulfill a wish to vanquish it, huh? Maybe that barrier works the same way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Cause, you know, I'm pretty sure that if you reject me, Mr. Monster will have something to say about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Ooooooooraaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>What a pain in the butt. Looks like it's gonna keep following me until I deal with...whatever this is I'm feeling. Desire? Longing? Curiosity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>If I'm lovesick...then I guess you could call that monster Lovesickness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Ooooooooraaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Whether it was the confused order of the world or of time itself that caused it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Enemies heretofore unknown to the people of this world, and even to Mira and I, began appearing before us, one after the other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Plunging not only the city, but the entire continent, into chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>This is bad! The city...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>This might be a bit of an exaggeration...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>But it seems to me that the fate of this continent rests with our love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>L-love...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>But you're my brother! My brother!</td>
</tr>
