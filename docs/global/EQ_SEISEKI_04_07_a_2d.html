<td>Heheh. If we're this far from the port, you won't be able to do anything. I'll let you down now, Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You seem to have calmed down a little. Seriously...you're quite the rowdy child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wh...wha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh! No, um...it's nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What is it? If you have something you want to say then say it quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>W-well...how do I say it...you smell good, Captain Yauras.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You...do you understand what the situation is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I-I mean...I never imagined being carried by you, Captain Yauras, who I admire so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You admire me?! You're a strange one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What are you talking about?! You're the most popular person within the entire Holy Guard, you know?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're the most powerful person with a sword, yet you have the beauty and smarts as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Also, not all your fans are male Paladins. You have hidden female fans as well. Of course, I'm one of them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh? You didn't know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>D-don't say stupid things like that and focus on your mission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Y-yes! Excuse me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>H-honestly...you're a full-grown adult, so you try to aim towards becoming a sophisticated and beautiful woman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Rumors...how shameless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hmph. How can you say that? Seeing you walk into battle with your feminine charm is enough to drive the wind of any young soldier's sail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Be quiet, Suzuka.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wha?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So, Captain Yauras, actually I have another question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Kanon...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh?! B-but...in some ways, it's a question about war strategy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What do you mean how can I look so strong and graceful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What a silly child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well, if there's one thing...it's that I had rivals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Rival?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes. Not wanting to lose to that person, I chased them until I naturally became this way. I didn't do any thing especially special.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmm. I see. In that regard, I can highly agree with you. It sounds familiar to me too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You had someone like that, Captain Yauras?! Who could it have been?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It was Captain Cadanova. The man whom you witnessed his end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh, looks like we've been interrupted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We can continue our conversation after we take them down. That is, if I haven't changed my mind.</td>
