<td>You...! How long do you plan on getting in my way?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ceclidis... Do you remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This...is Truth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>"I admonish the supreme! Darkness will overcome calamity and reach the gleaming tower!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>"Born from darkness, made limitless to become light. The principle of compassion shall allow all indiscretion to be forgiven."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This is...that same light...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That curse of yours is coming with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This...is where Truth...? This is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So in the end...I never could reach...the depths of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The light of Shadow Excelsior is gone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is where the Sacred Stones came to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>All that was made here can also be destroyed here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ha...haha... You... What do you plan to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You used Beelzebub's power, didn't you? You're in no less trouble than I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You'll go down right alongside me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hah...hahaha... So this was your plan from the start... To sacrifice yourself to kill me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And how are you going to do that? Even if Shadow Excelsior has lost its power, there's no way I would ever lose to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This is the end, Ceclidis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What are you muttering about?! You say this is Truth?! Whatever it is, I'll swallow it up, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Then, I'll swallow Babel up along with it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The two of us... We've already been left behind. We're history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>There's no place for us in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'll take my place with my own two hands! I have the strength to do so; to do whatever I want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>In order to make the dreams I harbor come true, I will do anything! I will change the world as I see fit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You have no such right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Lament to your heart's content, but you have found your fate. Now, all that is left is for you to fade away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Or, rather...for us...to fade away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Silence, you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You... With the last of your Alchemy...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Kamui, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hello, old friend. I was hoping you could watch my back one last time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I... You got it, friend. This time, I'll definitely keep my promise to you. I've got your back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>How sickeningly sweet. A reunion! And just in time for me to crush the both of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Just try it, Ceclidis. I'll show you the true power of my Spiritbonding, right here, right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>How disappointing. To be defeated like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>This body is in peak condition. Hahaha. For one hundred years, he built up this wretched body...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I did...all that I could...to attain what I wanted. I did evil things, caused...such misfortune.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And where did it get me? Here? Hah. Nowhere. I will simply...fade away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yet... Even when I die, Gluttony Foss will continue on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It will outlast this body of mine. I'm sure that Seriolde will do what I could not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What...am I saying? Hmph. What foolish thoughts are these for a man who turned the world inside out for his own ambitions? What foolish thoughts for such a one to have at the end of his life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>How embarrassing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It's done. It's finally over. All of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You have done well, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>This voice... Sephiron? Is it truly you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Cryphone has perished, and so, too, has our influence on the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Nothing is left to keep you here. The Sephira have no duty left to fulfill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I...appreciate that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ah... You have done as I asked, ever since I reached out to you over one hundred years ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Thank you, Kamui. I am tired now. I must rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I understand. Rest well, o Great Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Goodbye, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>In the end, I wasn't able to travel with you on your journey, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I watched it all from here; from beginning to end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It was a wonderful journey, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Thank you, and...goodbye, dearest Malta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>(Everything is...fading.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(All of the ties that once bound me to this world...are unraveling.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>My duties have finally come to an end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>That's a rather hasty thing to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You... Ouroboros?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Correct, and on your first guess! You know, I have been watching your battle with great interest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I suppose you might be right. In a way, your duties as Protector have ended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>However, there is still one score that you have not settled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>A score...not yet settled?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You don't mean... Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>If you disappear now, who will be left to interfere with his schemes? Of which he has many more, I am sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You are the only one who possesses both the knowledge and the power to contend with his Spiritbonding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>But... My life is already...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Will you accept a contract?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>A contract with the Truth. The last time we met, you had no need for such a thing. Circumstances are different now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Kamui, your actions could be remembered for centuries to come. I offer you power. Do you want it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It would give you the chance to carve your own path in history, instead of being led about by the grace and blessings of another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Rise, Kamui! If you want the power I offer you, I must hear the proof in your voice! In your very soul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>So tell me, former Protector... Who do you wish to be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What journey will you undertake next?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Who...do I wish to be? What journey...do I...want...? Do I...? I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I have... Yes. I do have something...that I want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It's...ridiculous. It's selfish, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I want to see what one hundred years has not given me the chance to see—even if I must make a contract with the Truth to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I don't need power. I don't want to change the world. I just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I just want to see what kind of world those I leave behind will create!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Please. I ask only that you give me the time to witness the moment in which the new generation creates the next chapter in the history of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>The contract is complete. I shall take custody of your soul until the fate of the Sacred Stones culminates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>We shall see for ourselves where the waves borne from the ripples your lifetime created shall lead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Watch out! This path is being used to transport the materials needed for reconstruction!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ugh! There's not enough money or time in the world to put this country back together! You there, put your back into it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What?! The rebellion is over! What is this talk of... What did you say? "Democracy"?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I won't stand for this! I will have to make arrangements to protect my assets!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Wow... Humankind's capacity for bouncing back never ceases to amaze me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Indeed. It's only been a week since this city was reduced to rubble, and yet there's already been so much progress in putting it back together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>It's due to the true strength of the citizens of this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Marie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Are you feeling better?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Yes, I am. I am sorry to have caused such a ruckus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>No, no! If anything, I did the same... Perhaps even more so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Never mind that! The curse has been broken now, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>So now we can finally return to Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Yes. I can finally put my sister's heart at ease.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Oh! Then... I suppose this is goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Aw, Marie, don't make that face. Saga and Gluttony Foss are only separated by the Ancient Dragon Bone! We're basically neighbors!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>If you ever feel like you miss us, it'll only take you a few days to reach us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Tina... I don't think it works that way for other people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Haha! Thank you so much, both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I'll need to remain here while we're rebuilding, but I'll definitely go and find the two of you as soon as I have the time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>We'll be waiting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>That reminds me... Logi and the others were planning to head out by boat, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Yes, I have heard the same. General Adelbert is seeing them off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Captain Logi! We have finished boarding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>We're saying goodbye to this country, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>It's best that we don't linger, now that the battle is over. It's time for the citizens of this country to decide for themselves what their future will look like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I was so surprised when His Highness announced that he would renounce the crown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Yes... It seems that Gluttony Foss will become a democracy in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>His Highness... I mean, Seriolde... He wants this country to reflect the voices of the people; to protect the interests of the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Until the restoration is complete, he's going to keep up the appearance of a monarchy, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>You should've seen the smile on his face when he was talking about it. I'm sure he'll continue to be a powerful icon in this country, whatever his role.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>He'll pull his people forward, into the future, alongside him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>He and Marie will definitely be a force to reckon with. I'm glad we could help them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Me, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Tina and the others will be heading back to Saga, too, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Yes, that's what they said, since Mocca's curse is broken and all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I'm sure we'll meet them all again someday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>So. You're leaving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Dias! You came to see us off?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Are you really not coming with us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>I still have obligations elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Then you'll be heading back to Northern Pride?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Mm... I will have to make my report. I must explain why my command veered from the intended course. I'll probably be reprimanded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>But...we're finally all together again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>I know. The three of us have...a lot to talk about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Then why don't you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I can't. I'm sorry. I can't risk Corpse finding out about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Or the Holy Guard, for that matter. It's best that they don't know anything about you, Agatha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>If the Lord Commander ever gave the direct order to collect the Vessel of Reincarnation, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Dias...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I am not strong enough. I need more power if I am to protect the two of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>What?! You're still on about that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>I need to create some kind of foothold within the Holy Guard... What you might call friends, or comrades, I suppose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>I need more time. A lot of it. So...this is goodbye. For now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Until we meet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>All right. Fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>What's with all the eye contact?! What kind of weird, boy's club members only, encoded communication is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>The two of you were always like this! You never change!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Haha... Hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Wh-what?! What are you laughing at?! I'm serious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Well... Goodbye, you two. I'll see you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Logi... Take care of Agatha, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Wait...! He's gone already! Every time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Dias is fighting his own battles, in his own way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>It makes me a little sad that he's on his own... It always used to be the three of us. Always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I'm not worried about him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Our paths, and Dias'... I believe that they're connected. Even when we're apart, our hearts are travelling in the same direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>...What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>I just didn't think I'd ever hear anything so cool come out of your mouth. Were you imitating Father?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>H-hey! I'm cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Hey. The ship is about to depart. You two ready or not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Oh, right! Sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Agatha! Wait! You're moving too fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Kamui! Don't encourage her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Haha, sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>So, do you know where you're headed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>I figured that we could head toward Greed Dike for now. I haven't really spent much time there, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>I recommend heading toward Wadatsumi instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>You're... The altar's Protector?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Oh, I was just borrowing that name for a while. It's the start of a new chapter for this world, so perhaps it's time for me to lay that burden to rest as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>My name is Monzein. I was once a Captain of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>You... What? The Holy Guard?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>I have been waiting for you for a hundred years, heir of Crowley; heir of the royal family of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>I... What? Wadatsumi? Heir? What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Head to the home of your people, Logi. Your destiny awaits you there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>My...destiny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Yes... At long last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Finally, with those words, my time has come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Th-this is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Myself and Georgios, we're made from the same stock; little more than visitors in this world, forged of Kamui's alchemical powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>My duty was to tell you what I have told you. It has been one hundred years since I was given that order... Haha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>I can practically hear Kagura and the others laughing at me. Seida would be especially... Well, she would...if she knew how to laugh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>I am sorry. I no longer have any power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>What you say next may be your last words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Yes, yes. I understand. Still, I'm glad I get to witness this; the moment when the children finally leave the nest and make their own way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>We're all connected, even now. Kagura, Bud...Seida... The lines of the justice that span this continent...continue on... ever pursuing...that very...justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Ah, yes... This is definitely the end. It's a nice day... Really nice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>So... Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>You've decided?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>I don't know what's waiting for me there, but whatever it is, I'm gonna meet it head-on, and overcome it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>This concludes my report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Well done, Corpse. The plan may not have gone exactly as anticipated, but so long as the same result has been achieved, I see no reason to take issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Satna has awakened, and Kamui has lost the blessing of Sephiron. This is precisely what I wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>What will you do about Dias Elysion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Dispose of him. That which lacks the strength to move the world... I have no need for such a useless pawn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>And our next stop...is Wadatsumi, is it? Hahaha! Things are about to get very interesting, indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>So, this Logi dude... He's really gonna show up here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Yes. If he's really headed for Gluttony Foss, then he must have heard by now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>We need to hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>I must find him before that man does! I must give him what I have been entrusted with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>Are you serious? You're just gonna make a break for it? Hell, working with you is no joke!</td>
</tr>
