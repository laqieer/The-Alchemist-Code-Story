<td>001</td>
<td>Prayer didn't help. The magic words were ineffective. I was powerless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yet somehow, even then, I continued to pray for peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wadatsumi was obliterated by Greed Dike in a single night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Shortly thereafter, every single shrine maiden and citizen of Wadatsumi who had escaped to the continent was captured and summarily executed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The few remaining resistance forces in Wadatsumi had called for peace and amity, but were refused, and so had attempted to flee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I remain in Wadatsumi even now. I still believe in a future where we will be able to join hands with our Greed Dike invaders. I still fantasize about the idea of an absolute justice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Despite knowing that it is a sham.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wish I could've had a proper bath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's too cold to be bathing in rivers right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You're not peeking, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Tomorrow's the day when everything comes to an end, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tomorrow, we'll be executing our plan to wipe out Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>They're an enemy who will not try to listen no matter what we say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So we have to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I just wanted to cast a spell of happiness on the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No matter the crime, there would be forgiveness. They would have a chance at being saved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I thought that it would mean peace. We could join hands, forget our hatred, and understand one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I was a child. I didn't know darkness. I was naively cheerful. An artless, common fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But that was your idea of true peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ikasa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Can I join you in the river?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Button...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm afraid of dying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Button. Hey. Look at me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Don't come any closer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Y-you're...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I will never forget that sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ikasa's body was...broken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Her skin had turned a ghastly color, and her wounds remained unchanged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Her fallen skin clung to her in twisted lumps. Her broken bones jutted out grotesquely, resetting themselves at awkward angles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Pretty horrible, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>This is why I only show the skin on my face, but even then I've gotta put makeup on to look...normal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wh-why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I can't lift my sword too well anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But I'm okay. It doesn't hurt or anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>There's only one right answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>A way to survive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>A way to kill them off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And your magic rites are going to make it happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I-I can't. It's not enough. My magic can't stand up to the armies of Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You once told me that your magic rites impact your vision, hearing, and sense of touch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That when you master them, you'll lose even your sense of pain and reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That you can use your memories to make illusions feel real. To materialize them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yes, but...my talents aren't fully developed. That's why I went on that study trip to begin with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Your prayer will make it real. Your rites require fuel in the form of a concrete image.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That's why you had to see the world. The more you saw and heard, the more you would be able to do, and at a higher quality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The number of your experiences is directly linked to the strength of your rites.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>This time, you're going to pray for death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>In order to do that, you're going to need to experience more death. The greater the number of deaths you observe, the more powerful your rites will become.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Wh-what?! O-observe...death? I don't... I-I don't understand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>To be blunt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The more you kill, the stronger you'll get.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>They call me the Obliviated. No matter how many times I die, I always come right back. You get where I'm going with this, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Wh-what? I-Ikasa... No! I... I can't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Help me die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Kill me. Over, and over, and over again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>N-no! I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Lady Button.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>What are you all doing here? I-I thought you were resting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>We want you to use us as well. Use our deaths to empower your rites.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>The wounded can no longer fight. If we are doomed to die, we would much rather it be as part of a rite for peace than at the hands of our enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Th-this is insane!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Y-you're asking me to k-kill...everyone?! To survive alone? How... How is that in any way the right answer?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>How is that peace?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Come morning, all of us here—the people of Wadatsumi, the soldiers, even you and me, Button—will be destroyed by the fires of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>We have no choice but to wait for death, but there is hope for your survival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Ungh...nnghh... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'll be right here by your side—and so will they.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Y-you're all going to...to disappear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>The more you kill, the stronger you'll get.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You're going to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Let us die for that.</td>
</tr>
