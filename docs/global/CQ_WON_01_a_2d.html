<td>Sup, barkeep! How goes the tavern?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You again? Hmph. Come as often as you like. I'm not gonna give you a job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Please! I'm begging you here! I'll do anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My pockets are getting dangerously empty! Just look at them! For the love of the gods, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Didn't you come here from Greed Dike? I don't have any jobs for outsiders. All right? So just get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Don't be like that! My jack of all trades business is doing terribly! Help a guy out, won't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why, hello! It's been a while! Do you have a job for me, sweetie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Blimey, Strie! You waltz in here after god knows how long, and that's the first thing you ask me, eh? I suppose you had another big loss while gambling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I did! I lost so much money! My purse is light as air!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Gwahahaha! You never change, do you? I've got just the thing for you, and the reward is quite a sizeable one, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh! I just knew I could count on you! So? What is this job? Is the client someone I can trust?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's from the mayor of a neighboring village, something for the good of the people there. They're willing to pay this much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Seems like there's been an outbreak of Wildpeckers. They're damaging crops and causing trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Really, now? This is quite a large sum indeed... I'm surprised a village mayor could afford it. They must really be in trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hey! Don't cut me out of this! I was here first, wasn't I? I want in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If you're taking down monsters, I'm your guy! You wouldn't take this jangly gambler over me, surely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh, my! You just jumped right in, didn't you? I've never seen you around before. Who are you, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm Won, a jack of all trades!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>He keeps pestering me to give him work, and I keep telling him that I don't have any jobs for a stranger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Come on! You can't do this to me! I've gotta pay my board at the innâ€”my tab's starting to pile up! Just give me a job! Any job!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I've no trust for you yet, outsider.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Fine... How about this? You two are going to do this job together. I trust Strie, after all. She's never let me down yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't mind doing this together. So long as you don't get in my way, that is, little boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Little boy?! Tch... But I've gotta pay my board before the end of today or I'll be thrown out, so I guess I'm in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Haa... Having no money sucks! I can't do anything! Tch. Whatever! I'll snatch back my freedom with these fists!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Tee hee. Are we all ready? Good! Then we'd best get going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We're almost there. Those creatures ought to be close by...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Probably.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>There! Careful, Won!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah, save your warnings!</td>
