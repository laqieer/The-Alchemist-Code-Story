<td>There are people who are icky-sticky and those who are sparkly-shiny. And I'm a black and white bear. Heh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The icky-stickies, for some reason, try to smother the sparkly-shinys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That's why I keep losing places I can sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hyaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ugh... You're always so noisy when you fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You do realize we are on the run, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Then why draw so much attention?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We just need to pummel anyone they throw at us. Easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't hate this. I like fighting with Glizzy. I can fight as I please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Glizzy is good at coordinating. I'm comfortable fighting with you. Comfortable and fun. Get it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No, I really don't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You're quite adept at coordinating with others in combat. It's very comforting to have you fight alongside me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I've been told something similar before, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Mmm? Glizzy, what are you thinking about? Old friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hey... I'm Glizzy's partner now! Remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Sure, but this isn't a competition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What about you, Glizzy? Is it not fun fighting next to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Not sure. I'm not exactly used to fighting at the side of someone like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Why say things like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's just difficult fighting with you. I mean, I do admire your prowess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Heheh! Of course you do! I'm good at pummeling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's just that... You draw so much attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So you hate fighting next to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No, I don't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Rawr! I'm hungry! I want something heartier! Glizzyyyy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey! Calm down! Don't yell my name! I've told you we never know who's listening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Do you regret letting Chief go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I wasn't surprised how things went. It wasn't hard to figure out how he would scheme to protect himself. He needed someone to pin the blame on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I don't mind being on the run like this if it means that Ishuna and the others get to keep their place to belong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Do you regret what we did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I don't want to be icky-sticky. I don't want to smother the sparkly-shinys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's right. So we should try not to draw so much attention that we smother them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Glizzy worries too much. We haven't been attacked by Wratharis in a while. Even if they come, we can take them easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That's not the point. But still, you're right. We haven't seen assassins from Wratharis lately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Did they get tired of getting beat up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>If that was the case, they could just send more powerful assassins. It seems more likely they can no longer afford to pay us any attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Have you heard? Wratharis invaded Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>They did?! Guess Wratharis really didn't like Envylia declaring independence. Wonder who'll win?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Envylia, clearly. Just between us, I heard Wratharis has been messin' around with Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh, damn. So now they've made an enemy of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This is good! Eat some, Glizzy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, uh... Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>So... Freed was killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>He was. Slaughtered by the Blue Flame Blood Wolf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I never thought a knight of Envylia would kill a soldier of Wratharis within Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I told you war was coming. So, now it is time for this secret weapon to be deployed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I will fight as a knight for the things important to me. I only hope you will do the same and not leave any regrets to mourn later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Is your old partner in Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>If Unicorn Knights... No... If Ishuna is in trouble, I'd want to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>(It was the first place I was able to smile after losing Rina.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(This black and white bear made me part of this world again... And I didn't mind that.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>All I can do is fight. So, even though I don't know how...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We should help Glizzy's old partner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But...I simply can't bring myself to fight for a country. Not like Anastasia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Because it's not clean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Countries and organizations are inherently dirty. I can't fight for those things, even at her side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Just fight for her, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Besides, Glizzy stayed with me. So I'll go where you'll go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Don't you hate the icky-stickies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>If it's for my pillow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Wouldn't I become icky-sticky for getting you involved?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Glizzy. It is my idea. I'm doing this because I want to do this for Glizzy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>All right. Let's go help Ishuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Glizzy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That's what I desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Eeeek!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Stop it! Get your dirty hands off of my family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I won't let you sully the one thing I care about! My family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Let's see how long you can keep that spirit up. Hehehe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>This is why.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I hate this world because there are so many of you who believe you have the right to do whatever you want with women and children!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Agh! You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Nasty icky-stickies. I'm gonna pummel you all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Glanz?! Rochelle?! Wh-why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You one of them too? Very well then, we'll play with you too!</td>
</tr>
