<td>001</td>
<td>See? I didn't need any help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You have fantastic skills in driving and battle... However.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Nnrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>My projections based on the data available to me was not incorrect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I-I still don't owe you anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Repairs complete. Moving to the next phase.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmm? There appears to be some problem with the engine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh? I can't release the acceleration! Crap! This is bad, really bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Calm down. Keep your balance and don't let go of the handles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I appears that your cooling valve is malfunctioning. I'll ride alongside you and repair it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You can do that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>"Acta, non verba."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It means "action before words". This is a prototype I made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What?! You're kidding, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm Reagan, maker of this prototype never meant to go on the market. How's that introduction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Permission to disassemble your transmission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ugh, fine! Just fix it, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Understood. Calculating time until repair...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Pheeeew... What a relief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Guess your stubbornness saved me in the end. Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I determined that your Alchemia bike was failing when I saw it before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What? You chased me down all that way to tell me that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Correct. I can't let a broken machine out of my sight like that. Furthermore, it's something I made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I see... Like me, you also hold a special fondness for your machines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey. Why don't you just ask what you wanted to ask me? I'll answer anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>All right. Initially, it was your Alchemia bike that I was interested in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>However, after seeing your driving skill I shifted my interest to you, yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh? Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The components I created certainly have their faults.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I tried used elements of ancient components to create the base design, but ultimately judged the whole project too impractical to actually use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You must possess uncanny focus and precision in your work to be able to make use of it. For future mechanizations, I want to consult with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well... I mean, if there's something I can do to help, I don't mind. In that case, first...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Wow! He's really got some skill!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The maintenance you did on my bike really stabilized it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I hypothesize that the people able to use that bike are now very limited, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You mean, as long as I'm the one riding this, it should be fine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Incredible. I almost even think you could really fly on this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hey, so... Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yes. My machine has been properly restored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hehe... I guess you aren't a complete stranger. You are the creator that truly moved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's not good to judge someone on appearance or rumors. You've got to get to know them personally!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>If you were truly moved by my design, perhaps you can give mechanization of yourself further consideration? I need your measurements: height, weight, three sizes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ahem... I'll gotta go. The horizon is calling me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Wait a moment! Why are you fleeing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I recall that you made a promise to assist me in my research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But you didn't say anything about doing anything to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What the heck do my weight and three sizes have to do with anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What else would it be for but to bestow you with a mechanical body with the ideal proportions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Anyhow, no means no! I'm still an innocent girl, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>An innocent girl? Data involving gender is completely unnecessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh. Wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>No means no!</td>
