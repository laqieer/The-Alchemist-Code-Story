<td>...You used the same pattern of attack just now as you did earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huff...huff...huff...! I-I'll be careful next time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...Are you already exhausted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Not at all! I'm just enjoying my training with you so much that it's causing me to get giddy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Good answer. Let's continue then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huff...huff...huff... Your guidance really is amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>At first glance, it appears crude and blunt, but your instructions are actually carefully calculated so that I'll fully absorb them. I'm learning so much from you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're also pretty amazing for hanging in there regardless of the beating you're taking. I think you're ready now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What...?! Then...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Let's engage in another bout.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Got it! I'm prepared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Then let's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Begin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ack...! Hyaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hmph...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You really are incredibly strong! But I'm not going down that easily!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...Then I won't hold back either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Whoa...?! Did you increase the force of your technique?! Either way, I'm going to keep up with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ack...?! ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>An opening! Here's my chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...I've lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes...yeeesss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...That was fun. This is the first time I've gotten so worked up over something that was purely competitive instead of life-threatening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's all thanks to your training! Besides, if you hadn't provided me with an opening, I don't think I could've won...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...I didn't want to step on that flower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Flower...this tiny flower? Ahaha. You really like flowers, don't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...I hope you're satisfied. I'm leaving now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, wait! Would you like to become an instructor at the gladiator training school with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I know that you're not interested, but still...! I want you to teach techniques to those training to become gladiators!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I guess that's a no. I think you'd make a better instructor when it comes to training the rookies than me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...But I am not their instructor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Their instructor...is you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>....Right. I need to face them head on and instruct them properly, just like you did for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh, one last thing! Please, tell me your name!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...It's Lamia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Lamia... Wait, are you Lamia the hero known as the Coquelicot Lancer?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...Well, of course, you're strong. But, next time we cross blades, I'm going to beat you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>All right. I look forward to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Also, this time I wasn't able to show you around, but there are some sweets shops I highly recommend! I'll take you on a food tour next time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yes, all right... I'm sure I'll enjoy it if it's with you. I'll keep that in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>So...I better run into you again! I'll be waiting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yes, Teona...one day. For sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...The next time we meet, I'll introduce you to the new-and-improved me along with my pupils!</td>
