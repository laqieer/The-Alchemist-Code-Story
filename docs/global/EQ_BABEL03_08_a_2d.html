<td>So you are telling me nobody knows where the Sephira have gone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Exactly. They simply disappeared without a trace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Someone must be sheltering them. Any information on that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Then you are of no use to me. Kill him, Zofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Work! Clean up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Pity. If he had more information... Well, no matter. I'll just have to scour the entire desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I suppose this is as good a time as any to officially begin the campaign. Zofia, let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Kay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Nefertiti! Are you here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Balt. My, what an unexpected delight to see you here. Is everything all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Where's Carla?! She hasn't returned since you had her come here! What have you done to her?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Please, calm yourself. I can understand why you might be worried, but she should be just fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So you do know what's happened to her! You nobles never change, always hiding things from the people of this desert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'll say it again. Please calm down. I know nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What did you do with her?! I already know that there's no changing the way you nobles only think of yourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Just keep Carla out of your schemes! Hawk entrusted her to me! I will not allow any harm to come to her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We all have our own ideas on how to help the desert. We aren't as self-centered as you think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Then why did you not respond to Hawk when he needed you the most?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Dang it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Balt. I envy that you fight for those you wish to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Are you willing to talk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's not that. I was simply reflecting on how some share their burdens, while others shoulder them alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>To protect the entirety of the desert, we need all of its inhabitants to work toward the same goal. Unfortunately, there are too many desires and needs among the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So each individual must fight in their own way for their own justice. That is all I can say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You! Do you know where Carla is?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Wha—?! I know nothing. Nothing, I say!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You do know, don't you? Please, I have to protect her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I said I don't know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Tch! You and Nefertiti both, what are you hiding?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I have someone I wish to protect... That's all I want to do! You nobles are always...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You keep so much from us, and yet you do nothing with what you hold back. I will never understand you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What do you know of my sister?! You have no idea what she has to endure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>She is kind. People may not understand or see it, but she thinks of the desert and the well-being of its people more than anybody else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Then why can you not understand how I feel?! That I would do anything for Carla!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I made a promise to a friend, and...I will not allow myself to lose another friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I have to be there for Carla! I swore to myself to protect her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Then...come with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>To tell you honestly, I find you all so unpleasant. You wail and fuss without knowing all the facts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>And yet, I too wish to be there for my sister, so...I may understand how you feel...slightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'll take you to Carla.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Thank you, Ramses!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Walk. That way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hm...mnn. Wh-where...? Where am I? Nefertiti summoned me and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Carla! Thank the gods you're okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Balt! Ramses?! What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>There she is. Seize her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What the—?! What do you want?! Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I won't let you take her! What happened to the guards outside?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It is the height of folly to think we can be stopped by mere guards. If you get in our way, you will share their fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Were they tailing us?! I was too careless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Take the girl. Kill the rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What are you—?! What do you want?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You'll have to get through me first!</td>
</tr>
