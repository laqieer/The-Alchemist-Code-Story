<td>002</td>
<td>Ugh…Dammit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Lord Ewan, who on earth were they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That was quite an impressive scuffle. Leave it to you to find your footing in the mines, Ewan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Mei Fang! Wait a second? Where have you been?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You were too busy dreaming up weapons to notice I was gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I went to gather information about the monsters--their origin, etc. Something was bothering me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Bothering you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Remember how we said these monsters aren't originally from this area?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Essentially, they're forest-dwelling creatures that rarely enter human settlements. So, something seemed suspicious from the jump.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>At the same time, we heard a group of bandits set up their hideout in the forest--a little too coincidental, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh dear… Now that you mention it, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The bandits cut down trees and drove the monsters out every night by setting fires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Fearful of fire, the monsters sought refuge in the nearest dark, damp habitat--the mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So, these people are the reason the monsters were driven to the mine…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hmm. But why would they go out of their way to make a hideout in the forest? Seems like a pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>They knew where the monsters would go and what would likely happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Precisely. Their goal was to indirectly shut down the mine and monopolize the sale of Felicitite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>They'd then sell at exorbitant rates to craftsmen. All the while mining freely by exploiting the monsters' weakness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Knowing that fire repelled the monsters, the bandits were able to manipulate them with impunity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Contrast that with the miners and security guards who were killed after provoking the monsters…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...Their petty greed got people needlessly killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>…It's always like this. A handful of brazenly selfish crooks cause the people at large to suffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>…It's unforgiveable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ewan…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Sorry, Lucia. Felicitite will have to wait…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…Hey, Ewan. Why do you have a glow about you, all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hm? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Until just now, I didn't think you had any sparkle whatsoever. But now…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You're saying I was gloomy…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's just, you're all aglow now! As much as the bride and groom and the miners!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Come on, tell me! What made you start shining like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well, to tell you the truth, I'm not sure. It's not like I consciously changed anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But, hey! If you think I'm aglow, then…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It must be because I'm doing what I want to do--not as a soldier...but as myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>…You know, like the way you do things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We're here. This is the bandits' hideout.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh? Who the hell are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We heard we could buy Felicitite here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, customers! Why didn't you say so? In that case, this is our current rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You've got to be joking. It can’t possibly be that expensive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If you don't like it, find another seller. I doubt you'll have any luck, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>From the looks of it, the mine's been closed thanks to those monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You don't say… Then how'd you get your hands on any?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Your greed has robbed so much from so many. And for what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I can't allow such unjust harm to go unpunished.</td>
</tr>
