<td>There's only Guard Droids here as well, aye! No, Ethan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That leaves only three compartments. Are they keeping Ethan in the front?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are you okay?! What was that shaking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Up ahead, aye! The shutter closed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Tsk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Squeak! Fire detected! Fire detected! Fire in the compartment directly behind us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh no! The smoke is coming this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What're you trying to do, little lady?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We need to cut off the rear compartment! If the smoke fills this one, we'll die of poisoning!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Aye, leave it to me! I can't get poisoned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Edgar, you think of a way to make it to the next compartment, aye?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Heh. You two have become incredibly reliable, you know? Good luck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It looks like this shutter is made of some special metal. Bullets have no effect against it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>In that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We did it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We were able to separate the compartment, aye! We're safe now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah. Good job, you two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Did you find a way to get into the front compartment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Are you good at tree climbing, little lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh? No, not really. Are we going to try climbing through the outside window?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>There's no other way. We'll jump onto the roof of the front compartment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Don't worry. It's not that big of a jump. We'll take it in stride, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Th-that's not the problem! If we fall...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What are you going to do about your motorbike, aye?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I've no choice but to leave it here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Sorry, pal. I know it'll be lonely, but I'll be back for you soon. Come on, let's go!</td>
