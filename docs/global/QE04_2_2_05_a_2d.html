<td>Death to those who break the law. This is one of Saga's codes. Will you make me go against the law once again?</td>

<td>It's true that, when I die, the power of the Wind Matter will be lost. However, that doesn't mean that all Wind Shamans will vanish. Have no fear.</td>

<td>Amongst our people, we have a power called Wind Divinity.</td>

<td>Apparently, she used that power to neutralize Beelzebub's gluttonous strength. Furthermore, she borrowed the power of Northern Pride's Sacred Stone to purify it.</td>
