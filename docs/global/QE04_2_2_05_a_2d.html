<td>001</td>
<td>What are you talking about?! Have you gone mad?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Kakkakka. I may be an old decrepit, but I haven't gone senile yet. And I always take things very seriously!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What purpose will your death serve?! For starters, if you—the Wind Sprite—were to die, what would happen to Beelzebub?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're the one who told me not to underestimate Beelzebub!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Before you start spouting irresponsible nonsense, aren't there more pressing matters for you to deal with?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Death to those who break the law. This is one of Saga's codes. Will you make me go against the law once again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Kakkakka. You understand as well, don't you? There is no other way to appease the people of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Fuu! The damage to our village has been extensive! I've lost both my child and my wife!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>My grandfather couldn't manage to escape in time! We know whose fault this is! It's Alia...he broke the law!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes! Death to all lawbreakers! Justice must be served against Alia...against the Alize people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You're being too rash!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Then what're we supposed to do?! We're well aware that nothing will bring back the dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But...how can we stop ourselves from wondering whether this could've all been avoided if Alia hadn't done what he did?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Fuu! Please! Understand our feelings!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The life of one old decrepit is a small price to pay to appease our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But what about Beelzebub?! What will you do about Beelzebub?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It appears that Beelzebub is currently being suppressed by Asena's power. That should hold for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Still, who knows when Beelzebub will go on a rampage again?! What're we supposed to do without you when such a time comes?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The balance between the Sprite Quartet is what's supposed to maintain Saga! Instead of taking responsibility by dying...shouldn't you continue on and try to rebuild your life?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You are a kind man. That being said, you don't gain anything from trying to stop an old decrepit like me. Kakkakka.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There's no need to weigh the cost of all life here in Saga against this one old decrepit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Alia... ....!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's true that, when I die, the power of the Wind Matter will be lost. However, that doesn't mean that all Wind Shamans will vanish. Have no fear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Even if the Matter turns to nothing more than a powerless husk, a time will come when it will eventually regain its shine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But who will look after the Wind Matter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Without you the Wind Sprite...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>About that...I had a granddaughter called Seida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I am familiar with her. She served as a captain of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Indeed. What a wonderfully gifted granddaughter she was. Regarding Beelzebub, I made her shoulder quite the burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>There was a time when I had Seida harbor Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Amongst our people, we have a power called Wind Divinity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Apparently, she used that power to neutralize Beelzebub's gluttonous strength. Furthermore, she borrowed the power of Northern Pride's Sacred Stone to purify it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Harbor...impossible! Do you mean she neutralized it within her body?!</td>
