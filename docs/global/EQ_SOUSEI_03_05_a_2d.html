<td>The Cursed Beast is here with us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You mean it's not sealed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>As its name suggests, Belphegor is a beast of sloth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It rarely ever moves. It sleeps beneath the ground, reveling in its laziness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It only moves when it turns in its sleep, but even that is a matter of life or death for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's why the most vital facilities of this region are kept on the floating islands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So everything and everyone considered valuable escaped to the sky, while everyone else was left to suffer down here to maintain them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>And that's how the people of this region live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's so awful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>As long as the Cursed Beast exists, there will be no safety for the people who live on the surface. That's just the way it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Let's not dwell on that. Now that we're done with the Fallen, let's go back to the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The miners might have found signs of the inspection team.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Right—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Another earthquake?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This one is huge! Everyone, brace yourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Over here! I've locked my spatial coordinates, so you should be safe next to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Emmel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm closer! Nimul, you help the twins secure their—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The ground is breaking apart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ahhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Emmel! Damn, I can't reach!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The shaking stopped?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Emmel! Adaleigh! Can you hear me? Answer me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Damn it... Did they fall into a lower tunnel? There's no way we can get down there from here. We'll have to go around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm on my way, you two! So hold tight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Urgh... Where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Emmel! Are you hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Adaleigh? Where are we? Oh, right! We fell down here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>W-wait, Emmel! You can't move around like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You're bleeding from your shoulder! Where's that first aid kit...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Found it! I'm surprised you can move at all with that. Doesn't it hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes, but I'm used to this kind of injury.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Don't push yourself too hard! I'm sure Nimul is worried. I'm worried!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Thank you, Adaleigh, but I'm really all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I can use Spiritbonding to stop the bleeding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>O-okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But where are we? It looks like we fell quite a long way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I think we fell into an old tunnel they don't use anymore. The Engineer Soldiers can't sense any Stones of the Gods here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>If so, it will take some time for Nimul and the others to come and find us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yeah, probably...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's just that I'm now wondering if Icona had an accident like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I think she'd be okay, but still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You're worried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm sure she's all right. We'll all meet up again soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You really care about Icona, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What?! N-no, it's not like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I just have a debt to repay to her. She can't get killed or anything before that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Debt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Right after we became apprentices to an engineer of Redington, there was an accident. She almost died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>There was an experiment with a magil compression reactor. It exceeded criticality and everything went flying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Icona protected me. She lost an arm and an eye because of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Even though it was all my fault, she always tells me to forget it, to smile, because she can just build new ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>She's a strong one, isn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Yeah, she's great. She always had more talent than me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>So there's no way she'll go and die in a place like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Adaleigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Grrr, arrgh, ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Fallen?! All the way down here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Emmel, stay back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Huh? But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You can't fight with a wound like that! I'll handle it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I'll protect you, I promise. So leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Take this!</td>
</tr>
