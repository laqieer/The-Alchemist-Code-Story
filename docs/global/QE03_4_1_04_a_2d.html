<td>I'm sorry to interrupt you when you're all stoked, but recovering the Sacred Stone is my job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>B-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Lisbeth...despite the fact you can use Alchemy, you're still a civilian.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Don't get any closer to the Sacred Stones. It's dangerous. There are those who got involved with Sacred Stones and ended up destroying their own countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If it's that dangerous then why are you trying to recover it, Dias?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So that I can take care of it before a civilian like you were to get close to it inadvertently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No...I don't think it's just that. Dias...you always have such a desperate expression your face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Please, tell me. I may be able to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You helped us numerous times, Dias...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If I tell you why I'm seeking the Sacred Stone...if I ask you for your help, it would make everything I've done to help you seem manipulative.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm tired of being used and using others in the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You're not manipulating me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I've been thinking for a long time now that there's something wrong with this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But, I never thought of changing this country or fighting against it the way we are now. I didn't think I could have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's because you obtained Alchemy, right? Power pushes people to action and sends countries into chaos...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No! The reason why I've come this far...is because I met you, Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Dias...you saved the strawberry seedlings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You said that the resolve of someone who would try to grow flowers in this land shouldn't be buried in the snow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>In this country, there is a lot of sadness that is buried in the snow. I want to brush that snow away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>To give birth to me, my mother had to suffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>She had to suffer the loss of my father.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>As a witch of Lustburg, we are the ones that need to fix this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Both that strawberry and I were raised in this sad land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Dias, you warmed that strawberry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Seeing that made me so happy. It warmed my heart too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That's why...I want to warm your heart as well, Dias.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If I can save you by obtaining that Sacred Stone, Dias...I want to lend you my strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Lisbeth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Is it wrong for me to want to do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I want to collect the Sacred Stones...so that I can be reunited with someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's someone that I swore to give my life to defend, but...I wasn't able to protect her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This time I want to protect her...and, in order to do so, I want to get the Sacred Stones before the Holy Guard does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Dias...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Lisbeth, it's true that you and your friends may be able to go above the clouds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Right now, the only one who can stop Asmodeus is you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I was planning on doing it alone, but, when it comes to going above the clouds, it's easier said than done. On top of that, I understand your motives now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If you truly want to save this country...then I ask this of you as well. Please, Lisbeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Let's go...Liz!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We've got permission from Dias. There's no one to stop us nowâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That's as far as you'll go, traitors!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Right, they're here to stop us!</td>
</tr>
