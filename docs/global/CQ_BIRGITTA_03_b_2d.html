<td>Looks like the fence is complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey! Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There's nothing more we can do here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This is only a temporary countermeasure. I'm here to solve the problem for good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We still need to resolve the real issue here. These beasts have nowhere to go. We can't say this problem has been resolved until we find them a new home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's true, but...do you really think that we can make a difference?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We? I've never seen you so eager to help before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I like it. Let's go see what we can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>H-hey! Stop pulling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Lady Mirianne! What a surprise. I suppose I should have known someone of your stature would visit this mine sooner or later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This is a very lucrative mine. Here are some samples of the gems that can be excavated here. I'm sure you will appreciate their value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>They are quite beautiful. I will take the lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A-all of them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Are you sure?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Absolutely. The gems excavated here are truly wonderful. I hope we can establish a lasting business relationship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh, of course! That would be fantastic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If we are to continue working with each other, however, you will have to cease any operations that are destructive to the environment. I would hate for these gems to earn a negative reputation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I've heard that the beasts that were driven from their homes because of the mining are now attacking nearby villages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It apparently became such a problem that they had to hire this soothsayer here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Isn't that right, Madam Soothsayer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, uh...indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I...I had no idea such a thing was happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Mining facilities that cannot coexist with their neighboring residents are sure to fail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I understand the importance of mining as many jewels as possible, but I would appreciate it if you could consider the effects your operations might have upon those around them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Y-you're absolutely right! I will immediately review our operations!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's wonderful! I look forward to doing business with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Case closed! What do you think of that, Madam Soothsayer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You didn't have to use me like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yet...how curious. He seemed surprisingly willing to change his ways, despite your criticisms of his mining methods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well, his priority is the sale of his gems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Even if some issues seem like they can't be resolved without one side suffering a loss...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If you dig deeper into the motivations of the involved parties, you might just find common ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I see. In other words, looking past what they say they want to get at what really drives them, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I guess sometimes getting involved can actually bring about wonderful results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Besides, what's truly important is that you do what you want to do, what feels right in the moment. Just like how I'm always acting on my motto.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Wouldn't that cause a conflict of interests?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Not necessarily. Thinking about what you truly want allows you to find the best way to resolve an issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Like how you wanted to protect those children and secure them a safe place to play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hey, you're back! Mom said we can play outside again! It's all thanks to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh...right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You've taught me a lot, Mirianne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What was it? Noblesse Oblige? I thought it amounted to nothing more than an excuse to meddle in other people's business, but...it's not a bad motto.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Well, it's better than doing nothing, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Heh. I'm honored to have the soothsayer's seal of approval.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Don't poke fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hmm...maybe I could stand to be a little more optimistic about things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Then maybe I can go and see what I can do for Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What're you doing? Come play! We're gonna play tag!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yeah! Let's play a bajillion rounds!</td>
