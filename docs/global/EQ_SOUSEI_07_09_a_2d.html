<td>...Ra! Mira! Wake up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Mmm, thirty more seconds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Just get up already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What, Nyx, whaaat? You're the one on morning duty today...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wait, I can't sense the timeline!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You're finally up, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Where are we? Why are we here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We're probably in a space-time valley.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The place where the past and future connectâ€”everywhere and nowhere. A void in time and space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ohhh, in other words, Quence's spell to return to the past failed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>There's a very good chance that's what happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>From what I could see from the outside, it seemed to be a directional brute force technique focused on just getting to a particular point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There might have been unknown info that wasn't accounted for mixed into the timeline which caused an error...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Sorry, but I didn't understand anything you just said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I don't really understand it either, but Space-Time Manipulation was definitely used, for sure. This is uncharted territory, even for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Where's everybody else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't know. It looks like we're the only ones who were flung to this space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We're not dead...right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We have no choice but to believe that in this situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So what do we do now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You ask, but you know there's only one thing we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Right, then I guess we've got to do it. Ugh, I wonder if Ambrosia will get mad at us for doing something this crazy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>She'll probably be pleased that she found a new research topic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>"Time is finite!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>"Yet also infinite!" Libra has granted us control!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I got a reaction from Libra!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's pretty weak, though. Maybe it's far away? Is that...a wall that's blocking the magil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But now that we've found it, there shouldn't be a problem! Space-Time Manipulation: Ignition! Preparing to connect to space!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Coordinates confirmed, jump initiated!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Tch! There's already this much damage to the town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Should we just crash into it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No, I'd like to keep the airship for getting the townspeople out of danger if the situation takes a turn for the worse. What we should do now is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ambush Cursed Beast Mammon from above and draw its attention away from the city?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Exactly. And then Minario will land on the outskirts of town and provide support for the soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Then let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>"I will transcend envy and become wrath!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>"My faith will be guided by two stones."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>"That which envelops me is intangible darkness!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We won't allow to do as you please any longer, Mammon!</td>
