<td>This isn't working! Every last drop of this ocean acts like a shrine for that thing!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The territory it controls is on a whole different level from other Cursed Beasts!</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>We have to separate it from the ocean if we want to stand any chance at all!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>

<td>Daphne, can you handle it?</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes, I will... Leave it to me.</td>

<td>Eh? What do you plan on doing with that shield?! Surely you don't believe you can actually stop a tsunami with that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I'm not planning to stop it. I will simply create a safe place for us.</td>

<td>To give the citizens of this kingdom a safe place to reside... That has always been this shield's true purpose!</td>

<td>No... No way! Did you cleave the ocean in half with that massive magil barrier?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Now we can separate Leviathan from the ocean's magil! So the next course of action is—</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Combining our powers so I can slam this blade right down its throat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>B-be careful! Splitting the ocean in two has left Mesarthim at its limit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We don't have a lot of time before the barrier cracks and the ocean breaks through!</td>

<td>Don'tcha worry 'bout a thing, Daphne. This won't take long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
