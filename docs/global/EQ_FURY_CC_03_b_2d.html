<td>You picked the wrong target.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I-I was just giving you a warning! I mean, two girls traveling alone? Let down your guard and this is what you get!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What does our gender have to do with it? Pretty sure you're the bad one here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Not like I profited, is it? All that luggage, and nothing but rags! What're you lugging this stuff around for? It's trash!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Take that back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What'd you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Take. That. Back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Why should I?! It's true, ain't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's her favorite kimono. Her best one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Like I care! Let me go already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Y'know, I've really been looking forward to this trip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If you ruin it for me, you're going to regret it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ikasa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hey, Button.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh, thank goodness everything's all right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>How is everything all right? Our luggage got stolen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That doesn't matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Look, I'll give everything back, so just let me go already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What? You got a problem with that arrangement?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>May we shake hands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Button...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Please. Let's shake hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Are you nuts or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I come from Wadatsumi. In my homeland, people once lived alongside demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm not here to listen to your rambling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>In fact, my nation was built on the relationship between people and demons. That is why I would like to make peace with you. To understand you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Tell me. Why do you steal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I lost a bet at the Colosseum, and am up to my neck in debt! So my fingers just sorta...slipped. Pfft... Bwahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You're pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>How about you, huh? Don't you hate me, lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I did think it was quite mean of you to do that to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But I left emotions like hatred and anger behind a long time ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Button...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Well, I suppose your fate is in the hands of the law now. Guards!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What the hell?! Are you serious?! You're turning me in? After all that? I thought you were gonna let me go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You did something wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It is only right that you pay for your crimes. I hope you can forgive me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No one is happy to be cursed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The magic rites used by myself and the other shrine maidens of Wadatsumi impact our vision, hearing, and sense of touch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The greater our mastery becomes, the more our senses are affected. Our sense of pain, even our connection to reality...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I believe that these powers should not be misused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's why you'll try and reach an understanding even with criminals?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I merely wish to lead the people of this world to justice and peace with magic words of comfort, rather than cursed rites.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I suppose you think that's awfully convenient of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Nah. I love it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I love that about you. I think it's a great way to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Still...this dream of mine likely won't be possible without my homeland's powers, or without people like you by my side, Ikasa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yet I pray that one day, we shall have peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Peace like the calm waters of Wadatsumi. Peace that brings equality and happiness to the people. Peace so absolute that hatred is forgotten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I wanted to achieve that peace, if only for those around me to start with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Now, however... I am beginning to see that I was wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I don't think so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Prayer alone is powerless, but use force and war will never end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Simply uttering magic words does not alleviate hatred. Instead, its curse will bite deeper and deeper into the spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>In the end, it appears that a ruler must have absolute control for peace and justice to be possible. At least, that is the truth I have come to see reflected in the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>However, I cannot become a ruler like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's okay, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Even now, I fail to live up to the grace of my name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Excuse me, Your Majesty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>C'mon, is that any way for royalty to behave? Pretend you're the ruler of the land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Wh-what doth disturb ye? Speak! We tire of thee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Mmm... Nope. Doesn't suit you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>That's just what I imagine a king sounds like...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Y'know what, Button? I think it's pretty rare for rulers to start wars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Then what causes the spread of conflict?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Lots of things. Religion, energy resources, wealth, land, weapons. Who deserves to control which power... The list goes on and on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Like I said⁠—I like your beliefs. I like that you pray for peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I think it would be great to have a ruler who asks foreigners and criminals for handshakes as readily as they do their knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>A ruler like that would be beloved by the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Ikasa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Excuse me, Your Majesty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Wh-what is it? Speak thine mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>And thou shouldst bow thine head when you speak to us! And keep thine eyes in front!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Huh? Which is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Hm? Oh... Can you bow your head while keeping your eyes in front? No, no, that doesn't work...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Heh. Her Majesty isn't sure what she wants, huh? Well, I am but a lowly soldier, but if Your Majesty would allow me to offer her some advice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>W-we will permit it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Just go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>G-go? Go where?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>To see the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>To the world's end.</td>
</tr>
