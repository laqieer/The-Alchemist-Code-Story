<td>I come from Wadatsumi. In my homeland, people once lived alongside demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thief</td>
<td>I'm not here to listen to your rambling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>In fact, my nation was built on the relationship between people and demons. That is why I would like to make peace with you. To understand you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thief</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>Tell me. Why do you steal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thief</td>
<td>I lost a bet at the Colosseum, and am up to my neck in debt! So my fingers just sorta...slipped. Pfft... Bwahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>

<td>How about you, huh? Don't you hate me, lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>I did think it was quite mean of you to do that to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>But I left emotions like hatred and anger behind a long time ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>Button...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>Well, I suppose your fate is in the hands of the law now. Guards!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>What the hell?! Are you serious?! You're turning me in? After all that? I thought you were gonna let me go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You did something wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>It is only right that you pay for your crimes. I hope you can forgive me.</td>

<td>No one is happy to be cursed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>The magic rites used by myself and the other shrine maidens of Wadatsumi impact our vision, hearing, and sense of touch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>The greater our mastery becomes, the more our senses are affected. Our sense of pain, even our connection to reality...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>I believe that these powers should not be misused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>That's why you'll try and reach an understanding even with criminals?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>I merely wish to lead the people of this world to justice and peace with magic words of comfort, rather than cursed rites.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>I suppose you think that's awfully convenient of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>

<tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>Still...this dream of mine likely won't be possible without my homeland's powers, or without people like you by my side, Ikasa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>Yet I pray that one day, we shall have peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>Peace like the calm waters of Wadatsumi. Peace that brings equality and happiness to the people. Peace so absolute that hatred is forgotten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>I wanted to achieve that peace, if only for those around me to start with.</td>

<td>I don't think so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>Prayer alone is powerless, but use force and war will never end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>Simply uttering magic words does not alleviate hatred. Instead, its curse will bite deeper and deeper into the spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>In the end, it appears that a ruler must have absolute control for peace and justice to be possible. At least, that is the truth I have come to see reflected in the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>However, I cannot become a ruler like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>

<td>Even now, I fail to live up to the grace of my name.</td>

</tr>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Button</td>
<td>Then what causes the spread of conflict?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>I think it would be great to have a ruler who asks foreigners and criminals for handshakes as readily as they do their knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>

<tr>

<tr>

<td>Hm? Oh... Can you bow your head while keeping your eyes in front? No, no, that doesn't work...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>Heh. Her Majesty isn't sure what she wants, huh? Well, I am but a lowly soldier, but if Your Majesty would allow me to offer her some advice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>W-we will permit it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
