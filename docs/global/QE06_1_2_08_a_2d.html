<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You're pretty strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But you are nothing compared to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Give it up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Azami! Where's Azami?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Do you mean that pitiful wretch there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Charging at me headfirst without a second thought. What a fool she was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Azami!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's dangerous. You wait here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You promised you'd do as I say, didn't you? Wait here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's not a foe you can rush in against without a plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That is the lord of the pure-blood demons. The Discarnate Power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You humans always amaze me with the extent of your foolishness. It does not matter how many you gather against me, you cannot defeat me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>How are you alive?! I saw Celis take you out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ah, that's right. I haven't yet thanked you for back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This is not good. Captain Ugachi, will you follow my lead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Though I'd like to remind you not to tell me what to doâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Fine, go on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Slug Bind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ugh, gross! What is that, a slug?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You know, this is a highly technical art.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Sure, but... I just can't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Geez, can you stay out of it, Amane? Captain Ugachi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Amazing! Is it done?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Not yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Blade Fox, huh? You lot are more formidable than I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It can't be...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ha! Thanks for the compliment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You will soon regret ever facing us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Tanosuke! Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>As if I will let you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So you thought you'd cut off my escape with a force field, huh? Do you really think so little of me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Unbelievable... Not a scratch even after everything we've done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Don't get me wrong, it stings a bit. It just so happens to be insignificant in comparison to how important our goals are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Your goals?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We're looking for something we've lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What we desire is behind a force field hidden deep within the Castle Aquila Rubrum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I just figured if I ate some foxes along the way, I'd be doing a service in helping Wadatsumi become more peaceful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Peace...? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>If there is a howling fox, it's best to devour it. Devour enough foxes and the human world will end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Then comes the age of demons! That is as Wadatsumi should be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>And there is one who will reign supreme in that world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>How dare you! It is your kind that is devouring people, plunging Wadatsumi into chaos!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>How dare you even speak of peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Demons do not fight other demons, yet humans constantly fight amongst each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>And as a result, they destroy the land. The corruption born from human greed will surely bring an end to Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It is humans who bring chaos to Wadatsumi. Is it not natural to think they ought to be eradicated?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Constantly in fear of being eaten by a demon, tormented by doubt against their neighbors, humans stain the ground with their corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The earth needs this corruption. When enough of it has saturated the soil, the one we serve will rise again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I just wanted to find what we lost before that happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You mean to tell me you destroyed Azami's clan and home for such selfish reasons?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The Kagomurasaki were going to be a nuisance. It's best to get rid of future obstacles as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Besides, it's the humans who tyrannically wielded their ideologies over us first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Why now? Why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It was not only one thing that we lost. And...we have discovered the existence of another lost thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>There is one among you who uses a strange art, am I correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Now, let me hunt some foxes. That should reveal what we've lost to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Here it comes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
