<td>Ramses! Are you okay?! We need to get back and tend to your wounds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No. We haven't gotten enough of the mineral yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>As the Successor of the Sun, there is no way that I can withdraw until I have completed your request in its entirety!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But...oh!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Screeech!</td>

<td>Here they come again. They don't learn, do they?! I won't back down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I must always remain strong! For I am the Successor of the Sun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You've taken out all those monsters instantaneously! When did you get so strong...?</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You're right! This beautiful color is perfect for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(More than the color of the paint, I wanted Ramses to compliment the radiance emitting from the portrait itself...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Heheh. Quite brilliant. I will continue to grow stronger so that I can be worthy of this portrait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Heheh. Nothing. Please, do assist me if I run out of paint again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Tsk... Only if I have time! I'm the Successor of the Sun. I'm busy!</td>
