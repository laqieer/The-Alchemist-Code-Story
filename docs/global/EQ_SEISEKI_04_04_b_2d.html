<td>You're improving a lot, but your grasp on Alchemia is still weak. Clear your heart and improve your accuracy!</td>

<td>And how exactly am I supposed to do that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You'll have to find that answer within yourself. Let's go again!</td>

<td>Ugh...ahhh!</td>

<td>Ughh....uhhh! Ahh...! Aaaahh...!!!</td>

<td>Try to make both your physical and mental state break the limit!</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well...it can't be helped. I'm tired now, and I'm sure the others will manage the rest.</td>

<td>I'm sorry for raising your hopes, Lord Zain. But it's gonna be okay, right?</td>

<td>You have Excalibur. Whether it be a Sacred Stone or the Mikaboshi, just do your thing and break it into pieces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What are you doing, Kagura! Don't sleep in a place like this! Here, get up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Be quiet, Kanon!</td>

<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Unlike you, I'm actually using my head while fighting so I'm tired. Let me sleep a little more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>For you to say that much you must actually be tired. All right...I'll do the rest myself!</td>

<td>Hmph...it's true, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You're really stupid, clumsy, and an idiot, but there's something about you that's strangely reliable.</td>

<td>Even without me, I'm sure you can take care of it real quick. I'm placing my chips on you.</td>

<td>It...it's too late now!</td>

<td>He got up...even after receiving the full impact of the Rising Sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ever since that day...ever since Wadatsumi's destruction, I've been relying on Kudan...relying on his strength.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Deep within my heart, I always thought the others would do something to help me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But...that's over now. No longer can I rely on other people's power...no longer can I seek his power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I have to do it...it has to be me!</td>

<td>Well done, Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Lord Zain?</td>

<td>You've managed to completely inherit the Kagutsuchi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
