<td>001</td>
<td>I won't make the same mistakes again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It seems the time has come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I must admit that I am surprised...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That you are here...and, well, appearing to be exactly as you were the last time we met.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You should have been more thorough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? I warned you that if anyone did intend to come after me, they would likely come prepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>How did you know that I would be in Slothstein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I knew that you wouldn't be able to leave the matter of that mysterious girl alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So you are here to throw away the life that you once barely escaped with, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm already dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Then what are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The justice of the continent, which I once worked towards, has been entirely lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I cannot return to the past. I cannot continue into the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I suppose that makes me a restless spirit who can't move on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It seems to me that you just don't know when to quit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I could say the same about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You... What would you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I know that while there may not be much that a spirit can achieve, there is one thing of which I am still capable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I can stop you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This isn't like me at all, but...it can't hurt to unleash one's full strength...on occasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Did it...work? Is it...over?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>D-did I...protect...Lofia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You did. You really did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You did so well! I'm so proud of you, Ravina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Eheheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>L-Lofia said...she's...proud of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We'll have some dessert together when you wake up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Heheh... Ahahahah! Yay! I get to...eat sweets...with...Lofia. I'm so...excited...I can't...wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ravina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>She's fine. Just sleeping.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Lofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Don't move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Wh-what the...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Guard the deactivated Demonic Soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Paladins...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We are the knights of the Holy Order who were stationed in Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We have been in Wratharis for quite some time now, however, investigating the ruins of an ancient civilization of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>There can be no mistake that the activation of the Demonic Soldiers and the damage to the city are your doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Many of the citizens here witnessed a girl with light blue hair attacking Redington with magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>As for you, Court Mage Lofia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You are the one responsible for subduing members of the Holy Guard in the ruins of Lustburg not more than a few days ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Y-you've got it all wrong! The Paladins who came to the ruins were in Lustburg illegally! They had no right to be investigating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I didn't even do anything to them! The ruin's defenses were what—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What's more, you murdered your fellow Court Mage, Michael, and fled to Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>M-Michael...? A-are you saying that you killed—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Court Mages are primarily charged with the duty of defending their country. A lone Court Mage invading a neighboring nation has the potential to threaten the Alliance of the Seven Kingdoms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Objection!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I am Inquisitor Cheryl of the Holy Order of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Is that so? Then there should be no reason for you to interfere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Court Mage Lofia is innocent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>A sect of the Holy Guard is plotting to have her killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>By utilizing the order of assassins known as Corpse, they have attempted to unlawfully conceal the truth of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The imperative of the Holy Guard is the regulation of Alchemy. The last time I checked, that certainly did not involve turning those skills against the general public.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Despite which, at this very moment all across the country, your organization is monopolizing Alchemy while at the same time consistently burying various truths and perils at your own convenience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>We of the Holy Guard adhere to the Alchemist Code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The secret you wish to bury revolves around the existence of the calamitous Cursed Beasts—which slumber in each of the Seven Kingdoms—and their connection to the Sacred Stones, does it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Should the truth come to light, the foundation of the Holy Guard's position as the sole proprietor of Alchemy would be greatly shaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Nonetheless, it is imperative that I bring this truth before the Inquisition, posthaste; that they may deliberate it at council.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>The Inquisition, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I'm afraid that isn't possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>And why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I've heard you out, but that's as far as this is going to go. Unfortunately for you, you don't have the right to do any of the things you just talked about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>This course of action is nothing less than my duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I guess I'll have to be the one to break it to you... You've been dismissed, Cheryl. You're no longer a member of the Inquisition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Dismissed?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I've got it all here in writing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>No... This isn't possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>For forcibly and unlawfully conducting an investigation that exceeds the bounds of her position as an inquisitor, Cheryl is hereby dismissed from the aforementioned role. That's what it says.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>No, I... I'm pursuing my mission directive even now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Don't believe me? This is an official document signed by both the administrator of the Inquisition and the Bishop of the Holy Order, Lord Waginau himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You have accused the Holy Guard of an outrageous plot, despite having been dismissed from your position. This is a significant crime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Moreover, we have ample reason to believe that you will flee if given the chance. Your accompaniment of Court Mage Lofia says much to that effect. As such, in these special circumstances...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Your capture has been deemed unnecessary. I have been given permission to dispose of you here and now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Cheryl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>This is far too hasty. I will return to Headquarters and negotiate with—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You aren't to be given the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>To accomplish our aim, we can't allow you to remain alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>You're the Court Mage, Lofia, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>A Paladin? Here in the center of the city?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>To accomplish our aim, we can't allow you to remain alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Corpse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>(So the Holy Guard and the Inquisition were in cahoots all along! Or did Corpse strong-arm the Inquisition into doing their bidding?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Cheryl?! What's going on?! Cheryl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>It is time. We will hereby eliminate Cheryl, former inquisitor of the Holy Order of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>(I can't believe that the organization that's meant to be responsible for the justice of the continent is this corrupt! Resorting to murder to cover up their crimes...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Other targets include the blue-haired girl, the sniper in the clock tower, and Court Mage Lofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>(If this is the future that awaits us...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I'm sick of saying goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>L-Lofia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>I have a very important promise that I must keep.</td>
