<td>This is the last one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ah, so you survived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It seems like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Still, these enemy troops may have gathered because you hadn't finished off the first one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I understand. I'm truly sorry. There was no time to hesitate when taking a life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You're truly a kind soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There is one thing I'd like to ask you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If...if you were betrayed by the one you cared about, what would you do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If you were robbed of the thing most important to you for a reason unknown to you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Could you...kill the person responsible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, first I'd determine the reason for their actions...or so I'd like to say, but actually I think that would be meaningless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If a person was determined to steal something that important to you, they'd have to have had a certain amount of resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Resolve must be met with resolve. That's what I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Resolve with resolve...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Or something like that. Anyway, I hate that sort of thing, that's why I'm just hanging out here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I say who cares about dealing with the hassle of things like family, honor, and revenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That being said, living freely also requires its own form of resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You're right. It seems that I lacked resolved on various different levels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Thank you for your advice. I'm glad that I met you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Actually, I am looking for my brother. He killed my parents and fled our home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I see what you mean by complicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's why I want to borrow your knowledge and your resources, Arkil. You're not really a fortuneteller, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Of course, I'm not asking you to do this for free. If you lend me a hand, I'll do whatever I can to repay you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I've resolved myself to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Heh. That's quite an expression you're wearing now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Very well then. Sounds like an interesting way to quell my boredom for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(Brother...I promise to track you down!)</td>
