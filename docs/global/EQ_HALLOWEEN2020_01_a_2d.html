<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Oh, wow! The Halloween Carnival is incredible! Just look at all these costumes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hehe, I'm totally getting into the Halloween spirit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ooh, look, they've got stalls! *gasp* Is that a teddy bear? It's adorable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...That teddy bear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh? Seen something you like?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No, it's nothing. Never mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why don't we go over our assignment one last time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Good idea. As I'm sure we all know, we're here first and foremost as guards for the carnival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>There are always some people who take the celebrations a little too far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yeah... Now you mention it, every year gets kinda crazy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Exactly. We're here to make sure that everything goes off without a hitch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The theme of this year's carnival is "Pleasant Surprises."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Halloween pranks should all be pleasant surprises, you see. Anything dangerous or harmful is out of bounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Our biggest job is to patrol the carnival, making sure that everyone is having a safe and happy Halloween.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We're also meant to hand out sweets to the town children and discretely add some extra surprises to the decorations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>An extra pumpkin here, a few more candles there... It'll be like one big game of spot the difference!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>With all the arts and crafts goodies they gave us, we can really get creative.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hmph! I mislike these garish festivities. All this orange and black offends my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's because Halloween used to be a harvest festival. The orange is supposed to represent the bounty of the sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Fascinating! Then this Halloween of yours is a celebration of the sunâ€”and thus also of myself, its successor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But of course. That's why Nefertiti was so pleased that you were coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>She said she couldn't think of anyone better to liven up the festival atmosphere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>My dearest sister said that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah, then what knave would disappoint the beauteous rose of the desert? Not I!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Rejoice, for the Successor of the Sun shall deliver the greatest Halloween this world has ever known!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's the spirit! Actually, I have a very important job for you. Would you mind handing out sweets to the children?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh, and I'd appreciate it if someone could prepare some extra goodies. We don't want any last-minute arrivals getting left out of the festivities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I can take care of that. I'm a little out of practice, but I used to be quite the keen baker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wonderful! Then I'll leave that in your capable hands. While the rest of you are getting ready, Rosa and I will start patrolling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>She's promised that she'll do her job properly this year. Although only time will tell if she means it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Say, did Cheryl seem worried to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Erm... Perhaps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Now, to work! What wondrous decorations I shall create!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You've sure gotten fired up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But of course! The Successor of the Sun meets his every trial with the fullness of his blazing soul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I have promised you the greatest Halloween, and I will spare no effort in keeping my word!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Besides, I would sooner die than fall short of my beloved sister's expectations!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hey, you're actually a pretty hard worker. Guess we've all gotta give it our best shot, then! Right, Julia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Julia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What? Oh! My apologies. I was lost in thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I agree. I think Ramses' attitude is admirable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We must make sure this carnival is as enjoyable as possible, and as satisfying as possible, for everybody.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Argh! Another failure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Try as I might, nothing I create can adequately express the brilliance of the Successor of the Sun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm not sure what this successor thing is about, but how's this for a sun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ah... Magnificent! To think that the sun's glory could be captured so gloriously with mere paper!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Now, let's get to work on that orange and black card. A cut here, a snip there...and tada!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Is that a jack-o'-lantern? I swear, give you a pair of scissors and there's nothing you can't make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Please, you'll make me blush! I'm not all THAT talented.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Such modesty demeans your handiwork. Be proud! It is no simple matter to create paper cutout art that is so bold yet delicate. It is the perfect representation for the Successor of the Sun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Say, how about we make them together? They're a breeze once you know how. Just watch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>A pumpkin lamp! Most impressive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Would that it were within my power to imitate. Alas, such work is far too dainty for my fingers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Mine too, sadly, but I admire that you can put that blade to such a creative use. It's like its own kind of magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Magic, huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I have an idea. Why don't we use these cutouts to decorate the town square?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I'm sure all the children will love them at least as much as their sweets. They're perfect for this year's theme, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You really think so? Hehe, thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You know, someone very important to me taught me how to make these cutouts. They said it was so I could use my scissors to make people smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Then these cutouts must be very precious to you, if they remind you of someone you cherish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yep! That's right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Very well! Then we shall set to work in the kitchen. I promise you delicacies fit to grace my own royal banquet halls!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>(Perhaps I overstated my abilities. Such delicate work tests even the talents of one such as I.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>(However, I cannot betray the expectations that my beloved sister has for this event. There is no challenge too great for the Successor of the Sun!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Are you all right, Ramses? You seem a little stressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Ah, Julia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Baking requires patience and care. If you let yourself get frustrated, it will only lead to further mistakes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Why don't you take a break and see how Blanchett is doing? Leave this to me for a little while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Perhaps I shall. I am sure she must be struggling on her own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>But before I leave, allow me to say that I am impressed. You are truly a master of the culinary arts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Please, I wouldn't go that far. It was just a hobby of mine, once upon a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>(No mere pastime can account for that hint of sadness in her eyes.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Yeah, she seems to have her lonely spells every once in a while. Honestly, I'm a little worried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You see it too, then. I confess, I had half ascribed it to my own overactive imagination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Nope, it's definitely real. She smiles and laughs along with the rest of us, but sometimes, when she thinks no one's looking, it's like a light's gone out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I wonder what's got her so down in the dumps...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Argh, enough! This grimace ill suits me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I am to bathe this Halloween in my radiance, and yet here I am with a face like a thunderhead! No, a smile better befits a pharaoh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You know, you can be pretty inspiring when you want to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Such is the duty of the Successor of the Sun to his people. Hmm... I wonder only if there is some way to inspire similar cheer in Julia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Aha! Of course! There ever was but one way to brighten a despondent damsel's day: a gift!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>That's a nice thought, but it's not going to fix whatever's bothering her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Are you certain? My dearest sister was always adamant that it would be most effective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Well, I guess it's not gonna do her any harm. But what could we get?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>...That teddy bear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You know, I caught her staring at that teddy bear back at the stalls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>A teddy bear? Perfect! I shall claim it for my own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Roll up, roll up! Fancy your hand at the ring toss? Land a hoop on any of this fine selection of prizes, and it's yours to take home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>A trifling trial for the Successor of the Sun! That bear is as good as mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Hah! Hup! Yah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Ooh, so close, but no cigar. Here's your last shot, buddy. Make it count!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Come on, Ramses! Put some effort into it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Hmph! I'll show you effort! Hraaaaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Not like that, you idiot! That's WAY too much follow-throuâ€”uh oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Oof!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Who threw that?! Hey, you! Think you're funny, huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Who? Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>No, the other guy braining people with carnival rings at twenty paces. Of course he means you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I'd love to beat your ass right here, but the rules say no fisticuffs at the carnival, so we'll have to settle this some other way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Get on over to the rifle stalls, pal! I'll show you why they call me the best shot in the west!</td>
</tr>
