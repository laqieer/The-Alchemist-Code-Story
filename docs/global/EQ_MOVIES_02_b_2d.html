<td>I think we lost them.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Phew! Thank goodness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>U-um... C-could you please explain what's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes, of course. I'm sorry. You see...we need your help. We need you to fight with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>F-f-fight?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What's the problem? You're the Phantom Soldier who's going to seal the Darkness, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Phantom...Soldier? I-I have no idea what that is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>H-huh?! That can't be right! I... I couldn't have summoned the wrong Phantom, could I?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Um... D-do you think you could explain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What are Phantom Soldiers? What do you mean by "summoned"? And...who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh! I hope you can excuse my poor manners. My name is Lisbeth, but feel free to call me Liz. This is Edgar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>O-oh, um... M-my name is Kasumi Nagasaka. It's nice to meet y... Wait. What am I saying? More importantly—where in the world am I?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Maybe... She's not from our world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No way... I'm a Phantom Soldier?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It all started with those creatures we were just fighting; the Demons of Darkness. One day, they suddenly appeared in every region of the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We set out to discover their origin, and we were still on our journey when it revealed itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The dark dragon known as the Destrolurk. A creature of legend, it devours all light that it may plunge the world into darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It possessed both the Tower of Babel and the Grand Excelsior, sealing all of our magic, witchcraft, and Alchemy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And engulfing the entirety of our world in midnight dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The people of this world still languish in this night unending, and if we do not defeat the Destrolurk, they will never be free!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I knew I had to do something, but I wasn't sure what I could do. I scoured the continent until, at long last, I found my answer in an ancient text.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It told of the Phantom Soldier who had defeated the Destrolurk before, and who could seal the Darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I retrieved the catalyst necessary for the summoning from the ruins in Wadatsumi, conducted the ritual, and summoned...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I didn't think it was possible for a dead person from another world to become a Phantom Soldier, but...here you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I see. So Phantom Soldiers are...the souls of people who have died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What are they supposed to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Fight our enemies. Obviously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Do you really need to summon the dead for that? I mean... Wait. If I'm a Phantom Soldier, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>D-does that mean that I died?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Come on. Are you trying to tell me that you don't remember kicking the bucket?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Let's return to the village for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What? You wanna take her with us? She doesn't even have any powers, by the looks of things! Not to mention... The village is at breaking point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I know that—but we can't just leave her here! So... Come on. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>O-okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Bwirru?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Come on. It'll be all right.</td>
