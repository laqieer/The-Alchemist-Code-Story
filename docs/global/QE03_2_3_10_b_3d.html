<td>Impossible... Kaiser has been...defeated?</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Kaiser's wound is healing?! What...what are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I've been doing it all this time. I've been sharing my power and healing the injured insects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>All this time...? Then those insects that underwent metamorphosis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>They're the ones that Liz healed. By no means was she trying to tame then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Lisbeth was just using Alchemy try to save the injured insects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's absurd. That will cause the healed insects to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Exactly! Kaiser! Finish off the girl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What...why, Kaiser?! Hey, come back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That ant knows as well that there's no need to fightâ€”that this conflict was pointless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You...! Did you do something to Kaiser?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>All I did was remove the spell you put on him. I returned him to the ant that he was before meeting you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's absurd! Are you saying that Kaiser didn't hate witches?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>He was turned into an ant because he loved a witch. People are creatures that are meant to love each other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Are you saying that even this insect hasn't forgotten the love he felt as a human?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Salomo...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Lord Salomo! Are you all right?! Leave this to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Tsk... Are they still gonna keep coming?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'm completely depleted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We withdraw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We've lost our trump card, and now we're stuck. Fallback and regroup. I can't afford to let you men die like dogs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>U-understood! I'll inform all the troops!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Salomo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Lisbeth...you were speaking almost as if you could fix the twisted nature of this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Is there something that inspires hope within you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes. It's something that probably only I can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>My hope has all but been extinguished. We've reached a stalemate. I'll leave the future of this country to your so-called hope...for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Just know this: if this country continues to oppress men...next time, I swear that I'll crush you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well done, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Now all that's left is to convince the queen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes! It seems like that'll be the most difficult...but we've gotten this far. Let's do it!</td>
