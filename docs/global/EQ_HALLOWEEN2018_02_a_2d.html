<td>Phew. Looks like we got things under control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey, Neica! You mixed magic with the candy again, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hm... I see. You are right. I can sense a small amount of Alchemia in these.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We humans aren't affected, but perhaps the beasts were picking up the smell of the outstanding Alchemia that they like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I always tell my babies that taming the wild children is quite difficult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I didn't mean to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well, what's done is done. We just need to be careful and guard the candies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>To make candy that even monsters can enjoy, you're so amazing, Neica! I have to try even harder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I told you, I didn't mean to, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I guess it's our turn this time. Melda, Mei Fang, let's do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>In order to make this year's Halloween a million times more sparkly than the last, I have a plan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>In addition to the very me-like flowers, we need new things and creativity. That's why I had you two prepare the candy and costumes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Of course. I remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>First is the candy. Mei Fang, go ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Naturally, IÂ am prepared. Now feast your eyes on what I have arranged and feel honored. Behold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You do not know? It is called bean cake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Right! I thought so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Vivi once bought these for me as a souvenir from Wadatsumi. They are quite good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well yeah, they're good, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No! Not allowed! Bean cake is definitely not allowed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Pardon?! Do you have a problem with these cultural delicacies?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes! I do! First of all, they're such a boring color! They don't sparkle at all! I told you to get something sparkly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Vivi chose these for me! It doesn't matter if they sparkle, or if they do not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Now, now. Calm down, you two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Melda, I'm sorry. I lost my cool a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Let's move on. Melda, the costumes please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ah, yes, the Halloween costumes. I prepared adorable ones!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh? Well you have great taste, so I'm sure they're wonderful. Your everyday clothes are always quite showy, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Haha. Such a forward compliment. You're going to make me blush. All right, come on out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Numa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What the... A Ratty?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What do you think? Cute costume, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I think the costumes that Hozuki mentioned are supposed to be for humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Numa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Obviously! What good will this do?! A Ratty! Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ah... I have a bad feeling about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Nuu, numa, nu...ma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Eep. It's staring at me. H-Hayate, what is it saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What? Oh, uh... "I'm Ratty. I got really excited when I heard that I could help with Halloween."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>"But...this sweet smell is overwhelming my senses and reason."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's staring at my hands intently like it's focusing on something... Could it be the candies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What? Really? Monsters really desire them that much?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Numa, numu, numaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>"Ah! I can't bear it any longer! Give me all you have!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ugh, seriously?!</td>
</tr>
