<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Great Beast Mammon... I stand before you once again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Now is the time that the deeds of we, the people of Avaritia, will come to fruition!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Even in the midst of destruction, my ambition is still unfulfilled!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Show me your power! The power we built!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>All that lies between us... Let these days of ceaseless battles satisfy my soul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon</td>
<td>Foolish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon</td>
<td>The people of the Avaritia Belt are this foolish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon</td>
<td>Do you long for your own destruction to this degree? Are you so filled with despair?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon</td>
<td>Kubera... You, who were born to the Avaritia Belt, the strongest of the humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>What you say is true. We humans are foolish. We're weak. Still!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>That is why we want power! And strength! And that is why I have finally made my way to this place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>My friend Roh Ku and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>The new blacksmith Yna Ku have forged this sword, Taurus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>And with the aid of his friends from another land...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>We start to fight for our right to survive here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon</td>
<td>Fight to survive, you say? That is what you people of Avaritia will fight for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>I am no longer the person I once was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Those of the Avaritia Belt desire only strength and mastery over violence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>That is why we have sacrificed many of our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>However, the priestess of Ouroboros said we would still perish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Bianca said that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Which means that method was weak. It was far off from the strength we sought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Thus, we who are devoted to strength, who are knees-deep in the sin of greed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>We must throw it away without hesitation. We must change our methods without shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>This man, Nimul, is strong. What is the reason behind it? What does he have that we do not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Saving a dragon fated to die. Preventing a girl from falling to sin. And just now, fearing for the death of soldiers who do not fear death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>The will to protect... That will makes him stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>If that is the case, then I shall emulate it. It is a small price to pay to become stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Lord Kubera! Then, you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>(I still think we differ over a very key point, but this means...!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Stand, Nimul. You will save this place, will you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Yes, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon</td>
<td>Incomprehensible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon</td>
<td>Living a toughened existence through a self-destructive cycle of cannibalism is supposed to be the purpose of the people of Avaritia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon</td>
<td>Are you turning your back on that? You would give up the hundreds of trials you went through for an idea that just came to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon</td>
<td>Incomprehensible. Incomprehensible. Incomprehensible! Is this wavering what intelligence looks like? How far will humans...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon</td>
<td>Unacceptable. I cannot accept this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cursed Beast Mammon</td>
<td>You all are unfit to be the generation that follows the dragons! I must destroy you all this instant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>The mass of magil has grown even larger? What is happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>It is no longer holding back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Pillar Beasts... Cursed Beasts are a system for collecting and sealing the sins of the human world. However, human sins exceed expectations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Sin is produced endlessly, stagnates, and becomes unstoppable. Due to this, Cursed Beasts absorb too much and go mad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>If the sin in a region is too insufficient, they will gain a certain amount of intelligence as Mammon has.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>However, they will eventually turn into simple beasts that only eat sin like those in the other regions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/drg_wagi_wiz_00.png" alt="Waginau" height="128"><br>Waginau</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/drg_wagi_wiz_00.png" alt="Waginau" height="128"><br>Waginau</td>
<td>In other words, we are seeing the reason and commencement of the destruction of this region by its Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Be that as it may, it doesn't change what we must do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>We must defeat the cursed beast with our own hands and free this place!</td>
