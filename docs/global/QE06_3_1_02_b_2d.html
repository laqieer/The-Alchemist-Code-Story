<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>That was splendidly executed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Indeed. It should appear as though they awakened the ancient Alchemic weapon hidden in the ruins only to be killed by it. Their punishment, no doubt, for meddling with Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>And of course, if there are any survivors, they will be charged with rebellion against the Holy Order for this transgression.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>A dreadful, pitiable fate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Says the most dreadful and pitiable man of them all! Purging your own Guard is not exactly a pastime of the honorable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Scarlet Flame Guard is on course to burn itself out anyway, whether I like it or not. This will do nothing but accelerate that process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Aren't you betraying that Scarlet Vow of yours, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Better that than resist the inevitable march of time and lose my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>A wise decision. And I give you my guarantee that you will receive what was promised to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't remember what happened, exactly. We just did whatever we could to stay alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And somehow, we did survive. But the entrance was still blocked off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I turned back to look at those of us who'd suffered so much in these ruins, and every face was layered thick with despair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We were trapped. Buried alive, essentially.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If only I hadn't followed the renegades so doggedly, we could have avoided this. Jubei had even warned me that it was a trap, yet I still persevered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It was too late for regrets, though. They'd do us no good in these darkened depths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yet, the regrets kept coming. They were all I could think about. I'd made so many poor decisions that had led to this moment...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Vice-Captain. Your orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Let's search the ruins. There might be an opening somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I held back the words swelling up inside of me, as I knew the truth would crush everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I could feel it. They were all hanging on by a thread—ready to snap at any moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Try as we might, there was no way out. Reality had well and truly sunken in. We were trapped here. This was to become our literal tomb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>None of us had to say it. We all knew it. We could all see how heavy it weighed on one another's shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Lady Celis... There doesn't seem to be any other way out over here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>This wasn't her first report to that effect, and it wouldn't be her last. But she kept trying. And I kept thanking her. We were putting on as brave a face as we could for the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I see. Thank you, Jubei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'll search the perimeter once more. I'll make sure to scour every corner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>In the midst of this dilemma, I remembered something I'd said not long before this mission. The words struck me a bit deeper now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Despite that, the Holy Order continues to send us into those ruins time and again to kill innocent people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I only had my own guesses and assumptions as to what may have happened here—my own theories. Not nearly enough to form any sort of reasonable conclusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But that didn't stop me from shuddering a bit as I considered the potential implications of...everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>None of that was going to help, though. Theories don't facilitate escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's no use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Don't give up. If we give up, we die down here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But we're going to! No matter what we do, we can't get these rocks out of the way! There are just too many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Even so, we have to try. Let's all get out of here, together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Vice-Captain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Quitting won't change anything. We have to do what we can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Get out of here together, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's right. Everyone, let's get out of here! Let's go home―to Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>All day long, we tried every method we could think of to escape from our earthen prison.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And it was only after hours of trying that we realized we had a rather large problem we still needed to address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It should've been obvious, really, but our minds were elsewhere. We needed food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Our rations had been running thin since before we'd even arrived, and now that we were stuck, they seemed almost comically meager.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Of course, it was no time at all before they were completely gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Please... I'll take anything... I'm hungry... So hungry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'm sorry. There's nothing left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>No... This can't be happening...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm so sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Why do we have to suffer like this?! I just want to eat... I'm so hungry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I was painfully aware how he felt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Even with all the resolve in the world, blind faith, and a sturdy katana...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The body simply won't function without food. It's the cornerstone of all power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Why did this have to happen to us? I kept asking myself that, over and over again, as my regiment collapsed around me one by one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Was this all planned? Had this all been some dastardly scheme?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>And even if it were, I was the one who pulled the trigger. I was the reason everyone was here, starving to death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'd made an error in judgment, and this was the result.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>All thanks to my own naivety...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Of course! My problem, my solution! I just had to cut open a path myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>With all my heart and soul behind every blow, I began slashing at the boulders. Futile, perhaps, but I kept at it—hacking away, bit by bit, pebble by pebble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I soon realized, I wasn't alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Jubei...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>As long as I can still move, I can still dig. We can't give up, Celis. No matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Thank you, Jubei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>How much time had passed, I wondered? How long had we been at it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>My katana had gotten so chipped, it almost looked like a rusty saw blade. And my arms felt much as it looked. But it didn't matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>The only thing left for us—the only thing standing between us and eternity—was this. It was literally the only tiny twinkle of hope we still had. So my body kept moving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Finally—miraculously—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Lady Celis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Everyone, stand up! We're going home―together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>When we got outside, the other Scarlet Flame Guard squad—the captain's—was waiting for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Something immediately seemed off about them, though. Perhaps it was that they weren't helping clear rubble, and seemed almost spooked to see us. But we were sure glad to see them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>And at that point, the primary concern on everyone's mind was food, so these red flags went almost completely overlooked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Some had succumbed to hunger, unfortunately. But we could still save a few, if we were to get them food and water quickly enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>That's what I believed, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Please give food and water...to the others. I can wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Yes, Ma'am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting. Can you eat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Can you swallow? No? I'm sure you must be famished. If you don't eat, I'll end up eating it all myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Please... Please, eat! Come on! Somebody! Anybody! Don't die on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Lady Celis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>They wanted to eat so much... Why aren't they eating now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Lady Celis... That person is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Come on! Eat! Please! Eat something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... It's all my fault...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>The words I'd been holding in for so long came spilling out all at once, in a jumbled mess. All the while, tears were gushing from my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I kept muttering the same apologies—the same regrets—over and over, even though I knew the people I was saying them to were long past the point of hearing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Over and over... Again and again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>What could I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>What could I do to change this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>The question turned into something preposterous. I was asking to bring back the dead. I was asking for another miracle—a real one, this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>But I still kept saying it. Over and over, again and again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Finally, someone responded. Except, they were talking about something totally different...yet equally preposterous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Wh-what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I repeat:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Vice-Captain Celis of the Scarlet Flame Guard, you are under arrest for suspicion of using the forbidden art of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>What?! That's absurd!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>It has been confirmed that ancient Alchemic weapons were activated within the ruins. This is viewed as a blatant act of rebellion against the Holy Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>And all such acts must be punished accordingly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Wh-what?! But, that wasn't me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>If I may.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I would like to give an official statement noting that we scoured every corner of those ruins, but found not a single sign of any renegade within.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>As such, it must be concluded that Scarlet Flame Guard Vice-Captain Celis, as the commanding officer in charge, is responsible for the activation of these ancient Alchemic weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Captain! How can you say that?! That was the renegades! They're the ones who activated those things!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>So you claim. But no renegades were confirmed to be present in the vicinity during this mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>The only people in the ruins were an archaeological team dispatched by the Holy Order for research purposes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I can assure you that everything Scarlet Flame Guard Vice-Captain Celis is saying is little more than a ruse. To what end, however, I cannot begin to fathom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>The punishment for this transgression is quite severe, Celis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>No... It wasn't me! Those weren't just archaeologists!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Of course, as the acting captain assigned to this mission, I must take some responsibility as well. We will accept whatever verdict is issued.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Everything was planned out from the start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I believed that this bloodshed would somehow bring peace to the Continent of Babel, in the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>But it was all a lie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>After that, nothing I said mattered. Despite almost dying in it, now that I was out, I had no ground left to stand on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>The verdict was issued in no time at all. Scarlet Flame Guard Vice-Captain Celis had acted with rebellious intent toward the Holy Order, they said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>In response, the public's trust in the Scarlet Flame Guard was tarnished beyond repair practically overnight, and the Guard itself was disbanded altogether.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>As for me, I was lucky to get away with my life. The tribunal took mercy on me, for whatever reason, and exiled me to Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Celis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>My dear Zeke...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>This is the full story of how the Scarlet Flame Guard was purged, and how I came to be where I am now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>What's the matter? Cat got your tongue, Celis Crowley?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Or shall I address you more formally, former Vice Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard, descendant of the house of Rising Ashes―and partner to the renowned Zeke Crowley?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
