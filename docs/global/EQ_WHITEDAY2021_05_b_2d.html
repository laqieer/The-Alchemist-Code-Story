<td>*Cough* *hack*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ugh, my nose... This sickly sweetness is making me gag. Are you okay, Tsuru?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>One way or another? Well that's good to hear. This is a bit tough for me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Still, that's no excuse. We made it this far thanks to those two making a way for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>This is all the mashiro flour, then? That man told us to incinerate it, if I recall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Okay, Tsuru. Let's light the fire, and head on back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I dealt with way more dangerous scenarios when I infiltrated as the Night Fox, but I felt oddly undaunted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Your faith in me makes me strong, Tsuru—I can overcome and any all obstacles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What? You feel the same, Tsuru? Is that right... I'm happy to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Just glad I'm not the only one, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah, we'll wrap this up together. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...And that's what happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Boy, that threw me for a loop. Didn't expect it to blow up like that. We escaped by the skin of our teeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Goodness, what a squeaker. Dust explosions are certainly no joke, are they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Not exactly the conclusion I'd come to, but to each their own. I'm just glad you made it back safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>For sure. And for some reason the monsters are all turning back to normal. Maybe 'cause they only had a small taste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Not only that, we'd captured those hoodlums nearby, so no casualties to report, either. Good news all around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We handed them over to the knights not too long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Really? So then that big old estate is practically unguarded...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Iyazoi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes, yes, I know. Can't imagine that noble having a change of heart, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Still, I'll keep my sticky fingers to myself this time, out of respect to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well! I appreciate that, Iyazoi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(If he tries anything again, Tsuru and I'll be more than enough to take him to task.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The marshmallow vendor didn't sell all that much, so those who ate them only became mildly addicted. Thank heavens for small mercies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>They'll be a bit cross for a spell, but I imagine eating some sweets should calm their agitation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The fair hall still has plenty of A+ confectionery to go around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Without the marshmallow stand, the attendees have moved on to other attractions. White Day is just getting started!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...Hey pops. Disciple guy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Young master! You've come back to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yeah. I still think the old man's way of thinking is too old-fashioned, it's just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's just, I know our sweets are the best around, bar none. That's why I'll think up some way to get them to catch on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...Gotcha. I knew you were just thinking of the shop's future. Sorry to make you worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So they've mended fences, have they? You can see the trust for each other in their faces. Yes, yes, very good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm sure he'll be fine from now on. Having someone believe in you offers untold strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm sure my tenure as the Night Fox is all thanks to Tsuru believing in me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Thank you, my partner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Wonderful, just wonderful. Look at all those smiles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Safeguarding the smiles of the people is a tenet of the Night Fox. That'll never change, even if I'm a Phantom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I modus operandi may have been a bit flawed up to now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Still, we'll keep fighting the good fight, and protecting the people's happiness. Right, Tsuru?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh, what a happy boy you are! Huh? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You were worried about me? Because Phantoms need to cooperate more than the solitary Night Fox ever did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But now you're relieved to see me embrace that necessity...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh? Now wait a moment, Tsuru. You leaving me behind back there was, what? A test or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The heck?! That means you didn't trust me at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Nnggrrr... Why I oughta...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...Hmph. Well I'm grateful you were worried about me, at the very least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You know, I think I'd like to buy this guy some inari sushi after all. There must be some around here... Come on, Tsuru!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Sheesh, not a sensible head among the lot of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So such unworldly people can survive in an age like this, can they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>This world might be changing to one that has need of life-giving swordhands. At least compared to the age we lived in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>In a world that needs people cut down, I want to hold dear the strength required not to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Leading the charge wasn't a waste of time after all, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yeah. All the stall wares look so tasty. When our mission's over, we should—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Oh, there you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Oh, it's you. What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Oh no, I just wanted to talk. I heard from my son that you're a Sosenko swordsman?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>This is the second time a life-giving swordhand's saved my shop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>The second time, you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>There was a time way back when we were having trouble running the shop, see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>At his wits' end, the proprietor at the time tried to mug someone to raise money. The guy was being guarded by a Sosenko swordsman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That man said, "No one got hurt, so I'll overlook this. In return...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>"Make sweets that bring sincere smiles. I want to protect a world where people can eat sweets in peace."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>"Don't worry, there's always a chance to turn things around while you're alive. So use it! That's my way—the way of the life-giving swordhand."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I dunno if that was your predecessor, a senior disciple or what, but I'm sure they were related to you somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>That swordsman's attire was pretty shabby, but he was a proud, upstanding guy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You're kidding me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Welp, I've gotta get back to my shop. Oh right, almost forgot. Here's a small token of my thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>A coupon for free sweets from my shop. Come grab a bite when you can! Bye, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>(On occasion, I've wondered whether my values still existed anywhere in this world...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>And yet, here they are... The ideals of the life-giving swordhand, passed down through the ages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>The disciples that followed me conveyed those teachings, which in turn saved someone. It's all connected...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>(I don't know what's happening in Wadatsumi now, but there must be someone who inherited the ideology of the life-giving swordhand.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>(If so, then one day I'll...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>That naivete of yours is infectious; at this rate, we'll run out of people looking to kill others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I bet the anmitsu jelly you could eat in a world like that'd be extra sweet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Goodness, I feel like I'm always on the receiving end of that guy's help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Oh, I know. I'll go use this coupon with Reimei. It's just about White Day, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I doubt he takes the spirit of White Day at all seriously, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I'm sure he won't say no to some goodies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Happy White Day, with lots of gratitude!</td>
</tr>
