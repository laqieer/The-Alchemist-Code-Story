<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>It was after the Lion Monarch's Charge that the Giant Taurus suddenly appeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This beast's destructive fury was such that it devastated the world, tearing open the still-smoldering wounds of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>To combat this new threat, the Lord Commander used a device known as a Mecha Weapon. This granted him sufficient power to go head-to-head with the Giant Taurus and eventually defeat it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Following this success, Judith, the Mecha Weapon's custodian, traveled around Babel on a campaign to wipe out any remaining members of the ruinous Taurus species.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What's more, the Holy Guard formed a special Taurus combat force, tasked with eliminating the creatures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The combined efforts of these agents saw the majority of the species wiped from the face of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yet some survived, and went on to evolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>And now the Taurus threaten the continent of Babel once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Just gotta connect these two here, and... Voila!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We're looking at a super speedy, extra-powerful weapon that shall hence be known as...mech gear! Yeah... Yeah! I think I'm gonna roll with that name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm pretty proud of this one! It turned out just as awesome as I thought it would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>This'll take care of any pesky Taurus...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And it can stand up to an enemy even greater than the Giant Taurus, like Basheeny was worried about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I can't even imagine what that would look like... Maybe something like the creature dad mentioned in his journals?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Together with the Mecha Weapon, those journals are the only things I brought with me from Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>"I can hardly believe it. To think that such a terrifyingly powerful creature once roamed these lands..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>"If this being were to be revived, humankind would face an unprecedented disaster. I must do what I can to create a device capable of combating these creatures."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I wonder what dad was so afraid of? Guess I'll never know now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But one thing's for sure. My dad invented the Mecha Weapon to protect this world and everyone in it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I want to prove that somehow. I want to show the world that my dad's invention is useful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If only there was a way I could make everyone see that the Mecha Weapon was meant to make this world a better place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Nrgh! Where are the reinforcements?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Grooooooaaarr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Uwaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Leave this big lug to me! I'll bring it down with a bang and a whoosh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Here I go! Huzzaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrroooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Thank you for your assistance. We did not expect to run into a Taurus here, of all places.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Wait a moment. That weapon you're holding—don't tell me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Um, this is a Mecha Weapon. Problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I should say so! The Mecha Weapon is a cursed weapon powered by Philosopher's Stones!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hold on—let's not be hasty. The current Mecha Weapon model doesn't run on Philosopher's Stones anymore. And don't forget that the device played a huge role in the previous campaign against the Taurus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Lord Commander Basheeny himself has stated that the Mecha Weapon is extremely effective at combating the creatures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Basheeny...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Exactly! The Mecha Weapon isn't dangerous—it's meant to help people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This Mecha Weapon alone has helped me save countless lives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's not a cursed weapon at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Even if that model no longer requires Philosopher's Stones as a power source...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It is still a weapon powerful enough to bring down a Giant Taurus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If it were to be used for military purposes in conjunction with Alchemy... We would face a crisis like no other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You deny that it could be misused?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I would hate that! I won't allow people to misuse the Mecha Weapon, for any reason! It's meant to help people, not hurt them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Even Basheeny said that the Mecha Weapon is something that can protect the peace in this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But...I know they're not the only ones who think like that. There are still heaps of people out there who think that the Mecha Weapon is some kind of cursed weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>And what can I do about that? It's not easy to change people's minds about something once it's got a bad rep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Well, I can't leave things like this, that's for sure. I need to educate people about the Mecha Weapon's true purpose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Maybe if I work with the Holy Guard to improve the Mecha Weapon, like Basheeny suggested...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'll be able to build a rapport with my fellow researchers, and help them see the Mecha Weapon in a whole new light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But...I dunno. How can I work with the organization that killed my father? It just seems...wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ugh! What's the right choice here?! Wish I knew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hey, Judith! You got a minute? I've got a mecha that needs repairin'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Sure thing! I'll fix it up for you in a jiffy! First thing's first, though—I've gotta take it apart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I don't think that's necessary, but... Eh, whatever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Anyway, you heard? Apparently, there's another Taurus outbreak happenin' in Saga. More of them giant ones, except they're even bigger this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Even worse, there're rumors that the Holy Guard's special Taurus combat unit or what have you has been wiped out. Scary stuff. Hope they don't make it here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Wait... There's a new kind of Giant Taurus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You need to leap higher, little frog. You won't reach the core like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Easier said than done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Outta the way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hey! Bud! Don't go rushing in on your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Somebody has to do it, and it doesn't look like you're about to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>(Right. I have to push on!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Bud, wait! Give me a second to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
