<td>Huh?!<br>What's wrong with this woman?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No, Chloe!<br>Don't attack her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I know!<br>I know, but if this goes on...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ugh! Please wait!<br>Please just listen to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Be quiet!!! I'll have you realize Zain's regrets like this!<br>Supernova!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>!!!<br>Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ugh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tsk! Quick on our feet, aren't we!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I-I'm sure of it! It's not my imagination! Those are definitely Lord Zain's abilities!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...?!<br>Hold on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That sword!<br>Could that possibly be Guren Blade?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh... t-this sword?<br>I received it from Captain Cadanova...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>How could a little girl like you have murdered not only Zain, but Cadanova as well?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh?! You got the wrong idea! Captain Cadanova entrusted me with this sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Don't lie to me! There's no way Cadanova would have entrusted his sword to a little kid like you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Try to deceive me as much as you like! It's all meaningless in the face of Cadanova's true abilities!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Let me unmask you with this one attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova's abilities?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Repent in the scorching flames!!!<br>Flaming Crimson Blade!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What?! This is bad!<br>Chloe, get behind me!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova, please lend me your strength!<br>Whhoaaaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Whah!<br>This is bad! What an incredible destructive force!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>H-how is that possible?!<br>How did you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Like I told you earlier, Captain Cadanova entrusted this sword to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I really can't afford to be standing around here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I cannot have Captain's Cadanova's trust in me go to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>S-stop lying to me!!!<br>How could I ever believe that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>How could Cadanova possibly entrust his sword to a little kid like you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You may understand if you'd just stop and listen! Calling me little girl, or little kid like that... Who on earth are you, rather?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I really don't enjoy being called all of those things by a completely random person like you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Now I'm pissed!<br>You'll definitely pay for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>My name is Miuna Ku! In the name of my great father Yogi Ku, I will knock you down!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You're the daughter of Yogi Ku?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Zain and Cadanova were the glimmers of hope that would lead the world towards the future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I will make you people pay for killing them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>This is bad!<br>She's going to attack, Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No, don't get hostile with her! She's just  misunderstanding! It's okay, I will definitely get our feelings across!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>H-hey!<br>Why are you sheathing your sword?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Miuna! This is all a misunderstanding! I don't bear any hostility towards you! Please believe me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What sort of trick is this? Do you think you can calm my rage with a petty line like that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's not a trick!<br>I'm showing you my true weapon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Weapon? What do you mean, Kanon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>My trust in justice inside my strong heart, that's my most powerful weapon! That's what Captain Cadanova taught me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I can see that Miuna also has this justice in her heart... My message will definitely get across!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Why don't you give it a try! You can try whether such a naive way of thinking has any effect on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>K-Kanon!!!<br>Get away!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>No, I definitely won't!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Do you really think I'll fall for your sweet words? Why don't you spend your time regretting in the afterlife!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Succumb to the hell fire!<br>Scarlet's Hidden Flame!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...You're quite a fool, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...I get that a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Are you seriously telling me that you're the next Lord Commander, whom Zain and Cadanova entrusted the future to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I know it's a big title... but I suppose I'm the 11th Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You look really different from the stories I heard. But I'll listen to what you have to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I didn't expect to run into a follower of Zahar. It's pretty troublesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Have you ever stood against Zahar yourself, Captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I've merely seen him from afar on the battlefield when I was still a rookie. But even now, I can't forget that malicious, murderous vibe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The winds are telling me she's near, but I can't see a trace of her. We have to assume she's quite skilled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Wind artists are quite troublesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It's not my intention to fight you.<br>Could you not give it up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You little scoundrel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Wait! We should not approach her carelessly! I'm getting some sort of dangerous vibe from her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That's exactly why we should attack her! Let's beat her at once, before she can even unleash that power! Doesn't that sound reasonable?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I don't know what she's plotting at, but the future of the Holy Guard could depend on this too! Excuse me, but I'm going to have you take a little nap!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Huh?!<br>What's the meaning of this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>She stopped a captain's blow with such a small body?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Oh, that aggressive spirit oozing from the axe! So that's what's going on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but please take a little nap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Whah?!<br>Arghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Captain Monzein!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Let me repeat myself.<br>If possible, I don't want to fight you people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>U-ugh!<br>T-take care, Seida! It's Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I can sense Zahar's malicious vibe from this girl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>This girl is in some way or another utilizing Zahar's soul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Please don't use the word “utilizing.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I've been keeping Lord Zahar's protection stone on me at all time, and he's protecting me through that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You're talking about a Philosopher's Stone?! What a malicious presence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Even if Zahar's will is in this stone, I can't believe it could have such an impact!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>No, even if she's had this stone with her continuously, it couldn't possess such an energy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I suspect that Zahar must have imbued that Philosopher's Stone with dark powers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>A Philosopher's Stone imbued with Zahar's malicious dark powers?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Malicious, you say? I cannot allow you to blaspheme Lord Zahar like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Shadow Messiah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I-I heard about that. How he fled from the Holy Guard, to disappear from the main stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>And how he proceeded to gather the best of Wratharis to form an elite corps. You must be part of that corps, aren't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>An elite corps formed by Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
