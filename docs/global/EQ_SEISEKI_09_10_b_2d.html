<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ack...! Stand back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>O-okay...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So you appeared here after all... Just like the Mikaboshi, you intend to protect Matter from our hands. Is that so, Captain Kagura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ack! O-of course! I won't hand Matter to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Heheh. That's quite the spirit you've got there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wh-what are you going to do? We're obviously outnumbered!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It's not a matter of numbers. Of course we'll stave them off here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>B-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'll create an opening. You two go and request reinforcements from Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>W-wait...what are you going to do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What do you think? If I can take out Orion, it will cause mayhem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'll risk my life in order to try and settle things here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You've got to be kidding! I can't let you handle this on your own, Yauras!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Me too! We need to stop them here or they'll end up getting us eventually!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You guys...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hehe...such a beautiful friendship, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Tsk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hey...what are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What are you doing? Open your eyes, idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I thought you were going to climb all the way to the top of Veda! Hey!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Where did that person...come from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Who did it? Who killed my friend?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It appears he's one of the Templars too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...! Are you a twin blade fighter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Hey...are you the one who killed her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>The wound on her body and the sword you have in your hand are strikingly similar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Calm yourself, Sol. Emperor Orion is speaking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Shut up. My friend was taken from me. If you're gonna get in my way, I'll eliminate you, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...! Uckkk...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Sol...?! You're the leader of the Templars?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hey...I'll ask you one more time. Are you the one who killed my friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Yes. I defeated her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...Tsk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Nothing good comes from hanging around with you lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Any man who raises his hand against a woman is worse than a dog. That's my philosophy...and yet you're making me do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>He's fast!!! Yauras!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>This goes against my philosophy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>But...I cannot allow the person who killed my friend to remain alive! That is our law!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...Ack!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>He dodged it! H-how fast can he be...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Dodged it...? Captain Kagura...is that how you see it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Is this the arm you used to kill my friend? I will dedicate it to her death!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Ugh...! Agh!!! Ahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...!!! Yau...ras!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Ca-Captain Yauras...your arm?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>You will never again be able to hold two swords. Now the title of twin swordsman will belong to Sieba alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Uckk...!!! Ru...run!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>

<tr>

<td>Captain Yauras?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ack! I-I'll buy you time! Hurry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>?! No...is that Burning Seal...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ta-take Almira...hurry!!! Report to...Ka-Kanon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What are you up to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...Agh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Yauras!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>What are you plotting? Your atonement still hasn't finished yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>U-ugh...! Ack...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>...! Wait! I won't let you continue any further!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Huh? Are you going to stop me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>...! N-no...! Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Agh! I-I won't let you have Yauras!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>This is penance for having robbed me of my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>If you're going to interfere, I'll take your head off...understood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Kagura...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Y-you've gotta be kidding me! That woman's death was her own fault!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Likewise, I'll have you make amends for the death of Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You're an unreasonable one, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>He disappeared...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>If you want to blame anything...blame your own stupidity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>?! Hu...huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Pay...with your soul!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>...! You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Ya...Yauras!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Ug-gfff...! You...you cannot die...he-here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>For the sake of Commander Za-Zain...Monzein...and all the others who have lost their lives...the torch must pass on to you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Y-you must not...die here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Ya-Yaurus...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Ugfff! I-I...will connect with you, Kagura. You must do whatever you can...to survive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Live...and report to Kanon and the others! Tell them to carry on my dying wish...and make certain that they all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Her belly is sliced open and yet...what tremendous will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Ugh...! Uck!!! Ahhh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>St-stop...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Come now... It is time for you to atone for all those you have buried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Ju-justice is...absolute...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>What's that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>O-our absolute...justice...will not succumb...to the likes of you...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Yauras!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>She kept her resolve until her last breath. I must say that I'm impressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>...! St-sto...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>?!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>!!! Noooooooo!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>!!! It...it can't be...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Just to confirm. We just need to get Matter, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Heheh. Are you asking why we came to the Saga region?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Don't worry. I just wanted to confirm that you would appear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>It doesn't sound like you trust us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>You're a group of vagabonds. Of course there is no trust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Enough. Matter is what will be responsible for ending the balance of power in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>There must not be a single error in obtaining it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Don't worry. This doesn't change the fact that Matter will be my reward to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>We're cooperating with you in order to obtain that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>There's no chance that you will suddenly decide not to keep your end of the bargain, is there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Agh...?! Le-let me go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Well, as long as we get our reward then all will be well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Is this the girl who belongs to the royal family of Wadatsumi? She should have a better sense of that than anyone. We'll have her serve as our guide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Do as you please. Let's go, Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Are you certain you want to leave it in his hands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Of course. Do you think there is any harm in leaving it to the man who is greedier than anyone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>More importantly, we don't have time to waste here. The time to encounter Nimul is imminent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Indeed. Sol...do follow your orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>I don't need you to tell me that. Off with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Annihilate all who serve the Holy Guard!!! Do not let a single soul live!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Ugh...ghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Ack...! Vermilion Bird!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Vermilion Bird! Take Almira to Northern Pride!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>?! Ka-Kagura...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Almira! Tell Kanon of our situation...please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Wa-wait...! Ka...Kagura...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>With Sol, the leader of the Templars, having finally shown himself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>His greedy eyes search the grasslands for any signs of the Philosopher's Stones...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>As for the Holy Guard...having lost an irreplaceable knight...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Will they be able to stop the ambitious end that the King of Beasts has planned?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>The balance of power tilts, as the world slides into chaos...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Unbeknownst to all, everything is being manipulated by a certain man...</td>
