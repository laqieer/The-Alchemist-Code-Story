<td>001</td>
<td>Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Did you save me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I did. You've been through much, but you can rest easy now. Letitia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(Ever since that day...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Thank you... My name's Spica. Um, what's yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(My world was always full of light. Although, it wasn't warm and bright like the sun...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(You gave me meaning. You showed me how bright and precious it could be—)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(The light at the heart of the darkness.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Spica, you've done well to come so far. I name you a sworn knight of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Serve our glorious country to the best of your ability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>O-of course! I vow to devote my all to its glory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Captain Zahar, the meeting's about to begin. You're expected to oversee the training of the new recruits after.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Right. I'm heading there now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Spica's got a good handle on everything, don't you think? Ms. Strategist?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's her duty. She wouldn't be here if she weren't good at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm just admiring your wisdom in recommending her to be Captain Zahar's armiger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I appreciate your flattery, Vice Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What's your honest opinion of her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>She simply wants to be useful to Captain Zahar. I made certain of that before having her promoted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Is that how you truly feel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What would you have me say? What merit would my honesty hold for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You never change, do you? Are you sure she's suited for what comes next? She's fawning over Captain Zahar all the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Do you think I would do anything without reason? She has a role to play in all this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>All of this, is for Lord Zahar's benefit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You really don't change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I will take that as a compliment. Regarding Envylia's new Scarlet Flame Guard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We've had more skirmishes with Envylia than usual these past few months.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(Captain Zahar hasn't changed at all since we first met.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(Oh, I shouldn't be daydreaming. We're in the middle of a meeting!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Moreover, Envylia has formed a new knight order—the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Each knight under their command is said to be a master of combat in their own right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>How does their purpose differ from the Blue Flame Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Their purpose? Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Captain Zahar, this file contains all our intel on them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>They were originally a band of mercenaries that were promoted to an official knight order under Envylia's banner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Former mercenaries, hmmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>However, they have a separate chain of command from Envylia's main forces, and have been granted the right to act independently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Captain Zahar, we've faced them before, back when they were still the Scarlet Legion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Do you think they will be a hindrance to our plans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Heh, worry not, for nothing shall stop Zahar from fulfilling his destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I suppose we'll face them in battle again. Perhaps they'll show us their "iron will" this time around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Captain Zahar, how come you've fought this Scarlet Flame Guard before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Spica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ah! My apologies. I shouldn't have asked a question so far above my station.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No, pay it no mind. I will tell you all about it some day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Your services are no longer needed for the day. Go home and rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yessir...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Your assistance was much appreciated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You're welcome, sir! Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I still don't understand what you see in her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Heh. I see nothing, Corvus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Oh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You have to see the whole picture, Corvus, and all the roles that each piece might play in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Of course. If you say so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Letitia, how is our progress?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Everything is proceeding according to plan, but we are still short.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We need power enough to surpass the Sacred Stones scattered about the land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>We need to create a Sacred Darkstone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>"Dear Silma... Today, Captain Zahar complimented me!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>"The work's really tough, but his words alone are enough to keep me going."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I have to give it my all again tomorrow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>(One day, Captain Zahar sortied out into the battlefield to face off against the Scarlet Flame Guard.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>(I was given a different mission, so I wasn't able to fight alongside him.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>(It pained me not being by his side, but there wasn't a shred of doubt in my mind that he would win and come back to us.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>(That was all I could think about.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>(Once the battle had ended, he returned to us safe and sound).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>(Although I believed in him, seeing him come back in one piece filled me with such relief.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>(However...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Captain Zahar, I'm relieved to see you back safe and sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I've finally met someone who can thrill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Someone who can...thrill you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I will use everything in my power to obliterate him! Hahahaha! Until we meet again, Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Capt...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>(That was the first time I felt afraid of him.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Spica.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Y-yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Ready my equipment. There is to be a large battle soon. I want my gear ready by then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>A large battle? Yessir, right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Hahahaha!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>One of us should've accompanied him into battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Captain Zahar's obsessed with Vettel, of the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Heh heh, we should consider it a blessing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Vettel will be but a stepping stone for him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>A stepping stone for him to rise to even greater heights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>(Finally, the day I dreaded arrived...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>(There, stood the Envylia army.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>(They deemed Wratharis a danger that had to be eliminated. If we were to lose...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Vettel, I know you're waiting for me out there! I long to hear your screams of terror! Heh heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>My left eye's throbbing again. The shadows whisper to me. Something bad is about to happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Vice-Captain, our top priority in this battle is to protect Captain Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I am aware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Come, Vettel! I shall make Gilrack into your grave!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>For the glory of Wratharis! Yaaaaaaaaaargh! Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>For the glory of Envylia! Yaaaaaaaaaargh! Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>(I must protect Captain Zahar!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Zahar!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Let us finish what we started, Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Exactly what I was thinking!</td>
</tr>
