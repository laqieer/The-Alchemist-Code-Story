<td>Hah...hah... Superb!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Was there really no other way, Lord Kubera?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No way to mix our ideals into your path of becoming the strongest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This was enough. I finally feel good for the first time in my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>How long has it been since I lost this badly? Or, perhaps... Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Nimul. In my final moments, heed my warning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The priestess of Ouroboros, Bianca, is not an ally to humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>She is only taking the measure of we foreign entities on this world of ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Her power will be needed to save this world. However, you cannot entrust everything to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Head to the land of pride... There, you will find the key to the reaching the gods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh, the greed within my heart. It is truly...truly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I will remember this well, Lord Kubera.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lord Kubera...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>He lived his life to the fullest. And met his end without regrets as a person of Avaritia does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I know...but... But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So, Kubera passed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Master Roh Ku?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I am now just Roh. The leader of our region has died. We must hold a funeral worthy of him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Allow me to assist you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Honestly... You fool. I never thought you would die before me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Master...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Heh. The older I get, the more prone to tears I become.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We knew each other for quite some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I would craft better gear and he would cut down the appropriate enemies. That was the extent of our relationship, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Forgive me... I cannot say more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If you would, leave us alone for a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Another life has slipped through my fingers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But that was the end he hoped for. We have no right to say anything against it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I suppose you're right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>By the way, how are you doing? Ambrosia treated you, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>About that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I can't fix you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What did you just say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I said, I can't fix you. This isn't your body from the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It seems it was left in the snare of time, outside the Shell of the World.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Then...I died?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I don't know. It is an area even I still don't know much about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Although, it hasn't affected the present you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You have some of your memories from the future, and that's not all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'd say you got a pretty good deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>No, the future will change...or, rather, it already has changed, hasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ambrosia, what will become of this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Nothing will change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Nothing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I am the dawn of Space-Time Manipulators. Do really you think I haven't thought about this? It is forbidden to rewrite the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>That's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I've performed countless experiments. I've tried my hand at changing things many times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The member of the Infinite Serpent who planned to change the past, that Space-Time Manipulator was Quence, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hmph, that idiot was probably blinded by some far-off goal and neglected his foothold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You can tell just by running some tests and going back into the past just a little bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You cannot change the history of the regions because the events observed by the gods of this world are fixed at their times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The gods of this world are surprisingly diligent on this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>They are always watching what we do. The tragedy, the despair, the joy, the fighting... All tangible memories with recollections.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Because humans without the right to access the laws of world can't disrupt or destroy anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>So long as the gods who set those laws linger, the past will never change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Except for the Avaritia Belt, which the gods turned a blind eye to long before it was destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>They turned a blind eye to it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's if you believe that Fallen Zafeiris's story. If you want to know more, you should ask him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>And that's all that I can say for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Long story short, stop worry about things. Whatever happens here, you'll leave here and be reunited with them eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Does this mean that I did die in the future?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>As I said before, I don't know. But my apprentices make it back safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I suppose you might be able to call it "back" if you use that whippersnapper Nimul's technique, maybe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You are too nonchalant about this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Ambrosia, that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>My body may be dead already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I feel you on the other side. It's all right; you are alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>R-really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>If we return to our time, I'll bring you back. Along with that girl, Benika.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Oh! Brother! And you're here, too, Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Skree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Benika?! If you run so much, you mightâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Geez, you're such a worrywart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>My body feels so much better thanks to Luke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>So, I can do a bit more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Oh! And I'm getting things ready for the celebration!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What celebration?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>A lot of people died and the town is pretty battered, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>We can't stay down in the dumps forever, and that time would go to waste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>That is true... Is there something we can do to help out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>She doesn't have long to live. She was born a Fallen and her sire, Mammon, has been destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>But there is still time. Even if we cannot foresee the future before us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>We still have time to dream about tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>(I still wish Benika was able to have a longer and happier life.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>(This is sin... A wish gone too far, something that was meant to be lost...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>(Something that you should just be glad endured until now.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>The compassion that triumphs over envy. The tolerance that repels rage. The control that resists gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>The innocence untainted by lust. The diligence to traverse over sloth. The loyalty to surpass pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>And the prudence not to be swayed by greed. And yet... And yet...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>They were not born into this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>That is what has led to this ending.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Lord Kubera's parting words may have been right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>The greed within my heart...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>No matter how much I may try to restrain myself, I am still a descendant of this region and the people of Avaritia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Hey, you, over there! This is an Avaritian specialty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Skree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Whoa! That looks good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>Oh, allow me to help you as well, Benika.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You came back pretty quick, Mira. Did you actually wash your hands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Quit acting like I'm a kid when I'm older than you! What do you take me for?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>My younger twin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>You know I'm older than you! What, are you going through a rebellious phase?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Sheesh, you two never change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Heheh, really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>That wasn't a compliment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Oh, um... Sorry, Ambrosia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>That came out of nowhere. What's the deal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Mmm... I just am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>If you're talking about Libra, it's all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I always knew you two would break it eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>What?! How rude! That's what you think of us, Ambrosia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>But you did, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Well, we can't deny that. I'm sorry, Ambrosia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Oh, Nyx! You're such a good boy, properly apologizing! You, on the other hand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Ugghhh! So I'm the bad one, again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>They look like they are having fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Are you all right? You took on all that corruption...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>The corruption actually wasn't that strong. It was within the scope that Spiritbonding could purify.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Naturally. My technique is that of a dragon's. I can control corruption more perfectly than any human could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Well, that is a very interesting point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Why exactly are you helping us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>It was the will of my princess, the being you call a God.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>As one who set the laws of this world... Is this really all right with you? One day, we will have toâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I do not know... I no longer know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>My princess will soon fall to sin, and the corruption of the human world has seeped into the laws of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>What lies at the far side of that is the same outcome as that of the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Law will be driven to madness by sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>And if that occurs, her will will be no more. Before that happens, I would like to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>I want to allow her to sleep quietly, just as she did for us when she attended the final moments of my dragonkin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>That is my sole wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>(This man is the enemy. He caused the Gula Belt Region to fall into sin, and he hurt my comrades from my hometown. And yet, I...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Her power will be needed to save this world. However, you cannot entrust everything to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>(I'm sorry, Zafeiris, but I am going to use your feelings...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>(To save the world...and Emmel.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Well, that was one crazy adventure! Not that it's over yet, but still.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Is there a way to return us to our proper time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Spending ten years here like this is a little... I have been thinking about this a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>The townspeople have been very kind, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>It kinda feels like they're depressed. I heard they were obsessed with the pursuit of strength, but now they're...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>They've lost their purpose in life. They spent decades battling in order to defeat the Cursed Beast, so it makes sense, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>It's kinda like a type of occupational burnout, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>They're a spirited bunch, so give them some time and they'll find a new purpose and move towards it all on their own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>I hope you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Oh, yeah. Nimul, Ambrosia said she had something she wanted to talk with you about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Ambrosia did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Adaleigh, are you actually Ambrosia's apprentice or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Nah, letting her think so makes her happy. See, she even gave me a piece of candy just a second ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>You've...gotten craftier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>What?! It's not like I'm doing something wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>What did Ambrosia want to talk about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>We can return to our time whenever you want to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>That's wonderful news!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>That said, I don't know what the future will be like now that we've changed the past here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Did I...make a mistake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Don't ask me, greenhorn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Listen, boy. Right or wrong is just a scale humans have made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>What others think of your actions just reflects their own opinion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Now let me ask you, do you regret your actions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Then, that's the answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Thank you, Ambrosia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah, don't worry about it. I just despise depressing conversations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>More importantly! Have you decided on a name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Huh? A name for what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>A name for your group, of course! The bad guys are called the Infinite Serpent, right? So, we need a name as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>I don't see why it's necessary...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Stingy. I work myself to the bone to help you. You don't feel the slightest bit embarrassed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Nimuuul? Ambrosia's a little drunk at the moment, so don't listen to anything she says!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>So, how about it? What's a good name for us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Hmmm, maybe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>The compassion that triumphs over envy. The tolerance that repels rage. The control that resists gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>The innocence untainted by lust. The diligence to traverse over sloth. The loyalty to surpass pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>And the prudence not to be swayed by greed. And yet... And yet...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>What do you think about the Seven Knights of Babel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>We're battling the seven sins. There's seven virtues... That not bad, buuut...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>There's my two apprentices, plus the machine one.... Our blacksmith, our knight... The other cutie knight... The priestess, You...and your sister...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Aren't there nine of us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Please don't count my sister in this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Besides...you said there are seven virtues, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>I am not one who bears any of those traits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>The people who carry the Gears of Judgment and fight the Cursed Beasts in the regions we've visited up until now are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Those who have mastered the seven virtues... I think they're the ones who should call themselves the Seven Knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>So that's your reasoning, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Did you just remove me from the group without a second thought?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Oops, sorry, sorry! See, you're more like the type that would do best as rear support, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>I am still a commander, I'll have you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Now, now. It's because you must take care of Sephira Village after all this is over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>What are you talking about, Nimul? You are the chief of the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Well, that is true... Haha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Oh, honestly. Pull yourself together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>(I've had the feeling in the back of my mind that I will eventually no longer be able to exist in this loop.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>(If the goal of the Infinite Serpent, the Ceremony of Creation, leads to their unhappiness...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>(If we cannot stop it, I will give my life for a tomorrow where Emmel and the others can spend their days smiling.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>(Am I that unreliable? Recently, I've been unable to tell what you are thinking, Nimul.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>(It feels as if you might go somewhere far away at any moment...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Well then, what about your sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>I can't find her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Emmel might be trapped in the snare of time Mira and Nyx ended up in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Could you find her the same way you did us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>I'll give it a try. Where is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>There. Now everything is ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>All that's left is for you to choose something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>But we all know what the answer will be. Right, Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Haaa...haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>Who...are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>It's truly surprising how similar you both look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>A child lost in Space-Time. You are a Space-Time Manipulator, are you not? Then leave. This is not a place you wish to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>That is certainly true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>But my new boss just had to meet you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Nice to meet you. Or maybe I should say it's nice to see you again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>You... I see. So you have finally made it here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>I'm sorry that I have to do this when you so kindly shouldered my burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>But I need all the Cursed Beast cores that you stole, Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
