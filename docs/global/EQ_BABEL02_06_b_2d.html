<td>Urgh!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huff... Huff... Huff...</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ila, you fought well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Corvus, you gotta show me some more of your tricks. I wanna be able to take them all on my own next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's been my plan from the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Spica, why are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The rumors of the Shadow Messiah led me here. I was sure it was you, Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I know fate sent me here to serve under you, my lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Please allow me to serve you once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Um... I'm Spica's little sister, Silma!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Can I join your band of merry minions, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You're both welcome to join my Shadow Messiah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We won't let you down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We've stripped the Holy Guard of their alchemy and pried the Philosopher's Stone from the cleric.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Letitia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Spica, it has been quite some time, hasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We're heading back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Corvus! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm right behind you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>

<tr>

<td>(Evil Eye, tell me... Why do I have to train Spica and Silma too?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Why did you appoint him their trainer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Corvus must build solidarity within the Shadow Messiah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Solidarity... Heh heh. He would surely excel at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Solidarity among comrades can mold them into a strong cohesive unit...but could also weigh them down like a set of fetters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Neither you nor I can afford to be chained down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You know I'm ready anytime, Zahar, my dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No, it isn't time yet. You still have another role to play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>As you wish, my lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>How is our progress?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The advance goes as planned. However, it appears we will need those notes after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Are you referring to the tome that was left behind at the Wratharis Research Laboratory?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes, I will begin a search for it at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I trust you won't let me down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Have I ever?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Together with the darkness in our blood, alchemy and the Philosopher's Stones will grant us even greater power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It is nearly in our sightsâ€”the power to utilize dark alchemy at will, and the unparalleled Sacred Darkstone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The creation of the Guard Stone is the key to eliminating the Holy Order forever. It will give me the power I require!</td>
