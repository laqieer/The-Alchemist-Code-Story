<td>But what about this Chihaya person? Wasn't she a shrine maiden of Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. Apparently, she remained in Wadatsumi after its collapse and attempted to revive the desolate, war-torn country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ohhh, I totally get it now. Chihaya really tried to make a difference.</td>

<td>Oh, everyone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Chihaya! I'm so relieved you're safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Please, run as far as you can from here! Don't worry about me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
