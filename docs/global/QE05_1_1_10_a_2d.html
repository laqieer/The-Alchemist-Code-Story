<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>It really is the Paladins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Here? Now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hey! Is that not Teona, the Arena Champion?! I'm a huge fan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Now, where might I find the commander of this army?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That would be me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That armor... Only generals of the Gluttony Army are permitted to wear that armor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So this must be the leader of the Liberation Army, General Leordas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I am the former General of Gluttony Foss' First Legion, Leordas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>My name is Waginau. We, of the Holy Guard, having judged that it is the Liberation Army that represents true justice, have decided to lend a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We appreciate the assistance, but we are a rebel force that stands against King Narol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I would have expected the Holy Guard to turn against us instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The Holy Guard believes in absolute justice over all else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The actions of the soldiers sent from the royal capital stand in stark opposition to those ideals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>To overlook the slaying of the innocent and the razing of blameless villages would be to forsake our moral code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Even the Lord Commander would do the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Then, I humbly accept your help. This harbor is a key stronghold for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If this place falls in the hands of the North, the people of the South would be exploited again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Um, if I may...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It may be because I live in the royal capital that I never got a real sense of how things are, but is the relationship between the North and South really like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This country was founded in the mountain ranges in the North.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What is currently known as the country of Gluttony came to be only after the annexation of the fertile lands in the South.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>From then on, a system was established through which the nobility in the North rule over the peasants in the South.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>And yet, we have endured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Unfortunately, the fertility of the lands that had once supported the people of the South did not last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The southern people believed their prayers will one day be answered, and so we persevered, but all that was left for us was this barren wasteland!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We were the ones who nurtured this land, developed it, and harvested its valuable resources, but the nobles in the North have drained all the wealth our efforts have produced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The southern people can endure no more! If this country does not change, we are all doomed to perish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>King Narol is a wise man. I am sure he would be willing to hear grievances from his subjects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I am aware of that. Even a King cannot fully ignore the voices of his people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>However, the separation of class within Gluttony, the nobles obsessing over politics, avaricious merchants who sell even other humans as property...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>His Majesty alone cannot change all of this. This country needs a total revolution in order for anything to change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>As interesting as this speech is, we may be better served focusing on the defense of this harbor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Of course. What are your ideas? With the enemy outnumbering us four to one, a frontal assault would be suicide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If we were to hide within the city, they would surely set fire to it, just as they did the nearby villages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You can leave that to me. As far as I can tell, the Royal Army's chain of command is frail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This is probably the fault of their commander. Crush the head and the body will fall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Create a diversion and take out their leaders? I would assume the enemy would be expecting that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We should also assume they will be expecting a charge by your Paladins after seeing them fight earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Agreed. Therefore, I shall lend you my Paladins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Leordas is on the move?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>They seem to be preparing for a frontal assault with the Holy Guard knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Send our forces forward! Ignore the Holy Guard and encircle them from the flanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes, sir! Surrounding the enemy, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Leordas, you fool. Did gaining a few reinforcements go to your head?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hah! Finally! I can now return to General Ceclidis with good news.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Who is the one letting things go to their head again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Wh-when did you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It was foolish of you to come here alone! Guards, get him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Now, Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme..."</td>
</tr>
