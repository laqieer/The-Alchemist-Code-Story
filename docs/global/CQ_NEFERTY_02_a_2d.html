<td>They misjudged their opponent's strength and attacked, only to run away. How disappointing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ah, I didn't want to owe you anything, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Please. That was nothing. Please don't worry about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I hate that smile of yours...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Aside from that, are you sure you don't want to pursue them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Uh, well, not really. I'll see them again anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh my... Is the reason you're here somehow related to them, by any chance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's none of your business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>My, my. How cold. And after I went out of my way to help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You told me not to worry about it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I was seen with you, so they might have thought I was with you. This could become quite troublesome for me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There've been a lot of kidnappings around this area lately. Those guys are probably part of that kidnapping group.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This is one of our main routes. We can't afford to lose business here because of people like them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Kidnappers... They're based here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yeah. I've heard rumors that they've been acting out of spite for me, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I guess it wasn't just a rumor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Why, it seems that you have enemies all over the place as well. Two peas in a pod, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I haven't done anything to them. I don't know why they've decided to hate me for no reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's just how it is, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But still, I can't believe Ankh would allow the man himself to come out after such a rumor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ankh did fuss about sending someone else out, but if they've got a problem with me it's quicker to deal with them myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So there are times when you feel like acting on your own as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's just that it's somewhat better to get it over with rather than to linger and wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If someone else can find the base, all the better. All I have to do is get there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I feel sorry for your men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You're one to talk. Well, I'll admit, I'm not a good boss, that's for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Still, I don't intend to be a source of trouble to the guild just because I'm being myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If our profits are compromised, a lot of people will be in trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Not only the Chamber of Commerce, but the people in the cities we trade with and the mercenaries who buy weapons from us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What Hawk said about a peaceful desert might indeed be nothing more than a dream of an ideal world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But the truth is, there are people who live off of arms deals, mercenaries, and other things that are the opposite of peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Peace doesn't bring a happily-ever-after. That's why it's a hassle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It is undeniable that there is a demand for certain services that is created by conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>And it's a fact that there are people who live by fulfilling those demands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Perhaps that's why Hawk's voice didn't reach the people at the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No one really paid attention to that... Neither Hawk nor the people around him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I suppose this land is too harsh to have peace. At least, not with the poverty we have now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Poverty of the body creates a poverty of the mind. It becomes natural to protect oneself with one's own hands, and not depend on others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No one should be blamed for not helping others when they're too busy helping themselves, even if it is disappointing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>In this desert, the only people who lend a hand to others are bottomless sycophants or idiots who don't care about themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If there was someone who could roll with the punches and do something with both extremes, something might change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Roll with the punches and use the extremes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I think you'd be good at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Me? Do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Don't you use your brother like that a lot?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...Ramses is inexperienced. He needs guidance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>He has spirit, but it can lead him into trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Spirit, huh? The complete opposite of me. I don't think we would get along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>In that case, why don't you leave a few more things to him? He's always looking for something to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You must be joking. Ramses is nowhere near ready to take on anything I have to give him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>He's young. He has a long future ahead of us. We shouldn't let him carry the burdens of the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I suppose you're right. Peace is meaningless if there's no one around to enjoy it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Not that it matters to me. It's someone else's job to figure that kind of stuff out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Captain Ryle! We've found the hideout of the kidnapper group! Wait, L-Lady Nefertiti?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Good day to you, and thank you for your hard work. Don't mind me. Please, continue with your report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yes... W-well, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Just calm down. So, what else did you find?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>R-right. Proceeding with the report. The group is selling their kidnapped victims outside the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>And we're almost certain that the buyers are in Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Gluttony Foss? Is this true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What, you know something about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I heard a while ago that some desert people are being kidnapped and sold as slaves to the people around Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I wasn't able to get any details because the conservatives were being a nuisance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>By the way, Ryle, your guild recently submitted several trade-related applications, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>That matter has been stalled due to the insistence of someone who says another matter should be resolved first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>That other matter is the resolution of the slave trade problem. If I am a witness to what happens to the slave traders, processing those applications may go more smoothly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You can't be serious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You are heading for the hideout, are you not? Do you mind if I accompany you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Suit yourself.</td>
</tr>
