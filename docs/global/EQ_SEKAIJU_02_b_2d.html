<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Thank you. Thanks to you, my senses have returned to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wow, I didn't expect you to have such a sweet smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I may be able to fulfill my original mission now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Your original mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>To correct the link to this other world. In other words, to resolve these events.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Resolving these events huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wouldn't that be the same as defeating the monsters who wandered into this world, and destroying the source of this phenomenon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Does that mean...that our objectives are the same?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It seems like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Let us work together then! That would definitely be more efficient!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That...I cannot do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh? Why not?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I lost my mind because of this abnormal transmutation, but still... I ended up hurting, even killing people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This is my problem, and I'm the one who needs to fix it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's why I will go and destroy the thing that brought forth these events.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The thing that brought forth these events... Now that you mention it, Ouroboros said the same thing. How do you know this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well...this same thing also transmuted me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If I go near it, I may lose my mind again, and I cannot tell how that would manifest itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I may blindly attack you three or the soldiers again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's why I suggest acting separately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Why? I think it'll be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If something were to happen to you again, we'll just have to do something about it again, like we did earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>R-right, we can do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I can hear the shrieks of the Owl Beast ahead. Since it's our mission to defeat it, we can't possibly stay out of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You guys...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Alright then. But if I start acting strange, please don't hesitate to cut me down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But you have such a sweet smile!<br>I could never do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hehe, weren't you the one who kept calling her scary until just a moment ago?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>D-don't say that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Come on, we'll be fine!<br>Alright, let's move on!</td>
