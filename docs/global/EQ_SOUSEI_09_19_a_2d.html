<td>What beautiful camaraderie I am witnessing! There's something special about seeing people put their lives on the line for each other. I've such admiration for that.</td>

<td>Particularly when it proves so convenient for me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yishai Ignacio</td>
<td>Whoopsie! I'll need you to hold it right there. Who knows what might happen to this fair maiden otherwise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Just what are you trying to do, you coward?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yishai Ignacio</td>
<td>Oh, spare me the lecture. Taking injured soldiers hostage makes perfect sense. I'm sure your dear old dad taught you to do that very thing, did he not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yishai Ignacio</td>
<td>That is, if you really are a true Ignacio, of course.</td>

<td>(On top of that, the enemy's getting more powerful with every second that ticks by...)</td>

<td>Well, would you look at that? Your hands are shaking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>No, they're...not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yishai Ignacio</td>
<td>So, will you do it, then? Will you shoot, even knowing what you stand to hit? Do you have the guts to do such a thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>(Just pull the trigger, Ignacio! I've let people down too many times before... If I stand by and do nothing now, I'll just be proving to everyone how useless I am!)</td>

<td>It's your move, inheritor. What's it to be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Obviously, I'm going to save her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ohh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yishai Ignacio</td>
<td>Even with that wound, you're still able to move?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Andechs?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Ugh... I'm fine, I'm fine. That could've been really bad, though, if I'd bungled it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Ah! Your wounds! This was too much for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>But, this is your sister, right? I couldn't just ignore her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>It's okay. She's just passed out. Looks like she's been through a lot, so maybe she's better off sleeping this one out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Hey, Ignacio?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>You go on ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>What are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I can't focus on fighting when my partner's weighed down with grief and regret. But don't worry; I've got this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>You're not making any sense! You're...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>I mean, I'm the person who's supposed to die here! It's supposed to be me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>It's the end I deserve, after betraying everyone. I've always had my priorities wrong, and let my emotions get the better of me. So just let me die already! It's the only way I can atone for my sins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Why...? Why would you risk yourself in my place? It doesn't make any sense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Look, I'm just doing what I think is right. I'm following my own sense of justice and righteousness, like I always do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>How about yours? What's it telling you to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Is it telling you to stop here? Is it telling you to die alongside the sister you just managed to get back from the enemy's hands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>That's a low blow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Oh, yeah, the lowest. Probably the sleaziest way I've ever asked a question in my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Live. Live on and keep fighting. You've got to keep going until you've made up for all those sins you say you've committed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>And even if you reach a point where you realize that's never gonna happen... Well, you just keep on going anyway! Might as well, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Thank you. I'll never forget this; I swear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Take care of Nimul and the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>I will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yishai Ignacio</td>
<td>Are you certain this is what you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Am I certain...what is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yishai Ignacio</td>
<td>Those last words came across rather like a bad omen. Maybe that companion of yours should have made his own choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>He did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Now can the chatter and let's get back to the fight. Just know that I'll have your head by the end of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yishai Ignacio</td>
<td>Really? As wounded as you are, you intend not only to fight me, but to win, as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>You heard what I said. Don't make me repeat myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yishai Ignacio</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>My name is Andechs. I'm a knight from Ire Belt. I stand for justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I pledge my blade to His Majesty, King Arius.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Please, hear my final wish...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Wait. Why is it you? Why are you the one who's come here? I called upon my king!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Arius</td>
<td>That sniveling toad claimed he couldn't fulfill his duty upon this corruption-stained battlefield, so I came in his place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Arius</td>
<td>...Besides which, I, too, am Arius, no matter how much you may choose to deny it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I see. I suppose you'll have to do, then! We might even make a pretty good team.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>My sense of justice is telling me that that cretin over there is our enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Arius</td>
<td>Understood. I shall ensure he pays his dues, then. Let us rush into the fray and make short work of our foe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>As if I need to be goaded into that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yishai Ignacio</td>
<td>I am a cretin, aren't I? This should be interesting. Let's see what you have to offer...Your Majesty.</td>
