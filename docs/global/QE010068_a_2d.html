<td>001</td>
<td>Don't you think it's time you told me your true intentions for willingly following me? What are you playing at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I simply wanted to reduce as many victims as possibleâ€”that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hmph. You mean to tell me for that reason alone you've allowed yourself to be captured by your enemies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I thought I told you that you aren't my enemy. I also originate from Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's right. Then, tell me this. Why do you not harbor resentment towards Envylia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Envylia destroyed Wratharis, our homeland.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Nothing is born out of resentment and anger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>How can you tell yourself that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You must be aware of the massacre that occurred at the Dawn of Wrath, where Wratharis was destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Zeke, Captain of the Blue Flame Guard, the man you call your father... He was the one who slaughtered your true family, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No! My father would never do something so outrageous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>He was merely a representative of Envylia in the Alliance of Kingdoms where they fought together with the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Even if he did not get his hands dirty, he must have been in a position where he could have prevented what occurred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The fact of the matter is that he was complicit in the massacre of your true family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Don't turn a blind eye to reality. The man you call your father happily watched as the people of Wratharis were massacred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No, that's not true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>To this day, my father regrets that he was unable to prevent that tragedy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>"The enemy's people, too, are the victims of this sorrowful conflict."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This is something my father repeats daily!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>When we as humans resent and hurt each other, it only causes us further pain and suffering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>As Agatha shouts this, tears blur her vision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hmph. You make me laugh. Whatever the case, the past cannot be overturned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Your words do not change the fact that Envylia destroyed Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Lord Sabareta! The Philosopher's Stones have been gathered!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Very well. My apologies, but the time for talk has ended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Philosopher's Stones?! What are you planning to do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I plan to use the Demon to purify this unclean world. I will show you a new reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Demon? Wait, you're not speaking about the ancient weapon, are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So, that's what you were excavating in the Gilrack Ruins after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Confine this woman to one of the prison cells.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Agatha, who has approached Sabareta, is forcibly pulled away by the Lizard Brigade. Still, she continues to speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No! The Demon is the weapon that brought about the demise of ancient Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You can't! Please, Sabareta! Re-think your decision!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Keep praying your useless prayers, Sister Agatha, under the Wrath-filled sky of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Smiling fearlessly, Sabareta walks away, leaving Agatha behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Sabareta, wait! No!!!</td>
</tr>
