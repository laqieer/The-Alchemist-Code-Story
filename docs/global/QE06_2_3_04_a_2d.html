<td>Welcome back! Food should be ready in about--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>…You.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You must be Kaede's...brother, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>…I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>…Well, come on in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I came here to make sure of something…Are you a man capable of taking care of Kaede? Can you be trusted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…Ah. I see. Just hang tight for a minute--food's almost done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…! I didn't come here to eat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Try my cooking first and then let's talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I tried it once already! I don't need anymore…!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That was barely an appetizer. I've got plenty more where that came from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…Here, it's ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm telling you--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>"The earth is great. The earth is good. Let us thank her for our food."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We say a prayer before we eat to show gratitude to our food. Demons could stand to do the same. I taught it to Kaede, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's rich coming from a human--your kind flagrantly disregards life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Back in the day, when I first started cooking, I hunted… I set up some bait and was waiting until my prey went for it--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't try to change the subject.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Just hear me out… So, while the beast was distracted by the bait, I made my approach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's when the it looked right at me. I thought I was done for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But, instead, it went back to eating… As long as it could fill its stomach, it didn't need to bother me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>…What're you getting at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I hunted that beast. I killed it so that I could eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's why I'm alive now--because I took that beast's life…Don't you see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No, I don't! Just make your point already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We've got to be grateful… To the lives that are connected to ours… And in my case--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That includes you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If it weren't for you, I might never have met Kaede. Thanks to her--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I finally feel like Wadatsumi has a shot at peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So…eat up! That way you'll know I'm the type of person that values life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>…I talk a big game, but I just want Kaede's big brother to understand where I'm coming from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>So? Care to try some?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>…Sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Whatcha think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>…I think…I understand you a bit more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I was wrong about your kind…This meal proves you do value life. That much is clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>…But that doesn't mean I can forgive humans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Easy there! Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Now, it's time you understand me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Gettin' pretty rowdy there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Don't waste you breath!!</td>
