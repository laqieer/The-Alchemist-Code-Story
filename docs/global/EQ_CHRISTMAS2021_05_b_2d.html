<td>N-numaaa…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Phew… They finally calmed down a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>…They were fighting really hard to protect their tree and snow sculptures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yeah… Looks like we really did end up interfering with their holiday party. Now I feel kinda bad…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Mer…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Look, they must have made all these by hand. It looks like they were really enjoying themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yeah, they're really pretty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hey, by any chance, are you guys…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What's all this commotion? I can't focus on my work at all over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...Wait a minute. Aren't those the decorations I sent off with the delivery person? What are they doing in a place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>N-numa…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…I see, so they just wanted to try having a holiday party of their own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It sounds like they learned by watching people, but even after all their preparations, they still felt like something was missing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But as soon as they saw the decorations, they knew they were exactly what they needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Rochelle, you can…understand these creatures?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well I did grow up in the forest, you know. I wouldn't be much of a black and white bear if I couldn't even understand this much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I… Wow… Never underestimate black and white bears, I guess…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Even beasts can tell how great these decorations are. They really do add to the the snow sculptures. The party just wouldn't be the same without them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's why they stole them from the delivery person. And then they knocked down all those trees and made a wall to prevent anyone from interfering with their party.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So that's what happened to all those trees…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>When they gathered around the boy earlier, they weren't trying to surround him. They just wanted to invite him to their holiday party. The holidays are for the kids, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wow, I never would have guessed…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Though come to think of it, wasn't there another creature before that ran off with someone's stuffed animal because they wanted presents too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>…Though I can't say I don't understand the feeling. Everyone wants to enjoy the holidays, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yep, looks like you get it too, Ravi. But there are people back in town who are counting on these decorations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Not to mention someone who's doing her best to protect everyone's happy times spent with the people dear to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ishi's doing her best out there, and that's why I'm gonna do my best to help her too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's why we can't let you keep these decorations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Numa…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ah, quit it with the long faces, will ya? Can't say my goods have ever been this in demand before, but a skilled craftsman can keep up with any order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'll whip up some new decorations for you lickedy-split! Can't keep the party waiting, can we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Numa!? Numa! Numaaa!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Wow! Everyone looks so happy. Isn't this great, Rochelle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>They really do, don't they? Now everyone can have a happy winter holiday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Phew... Looks like we managed to make it back before the start of the contest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Look, that man from earlier is making a snow sculpture of the Maruda Tribe. His son must be thrilled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It looks great with all the decorations you two managed to get back. You really saved the day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hehe</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'll say. It sure took you guys a while to make it back, though. I was worried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But...I guess it all worked out in the end. I'm glad you were able to get a bit of your holiday cheer back too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...? I wasn't cheery?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Not at all. You didn't realize? I thought you didn't want to spend the holidays with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>! Of course I do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>After losing Helza, it's only thanks to you that I've been able to sleep. There's no one else I'd rather be with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Why would you think something like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Well, earlier...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You seemed upset about something when you came back from the market.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>When I tried to talk to you, you barely even responded. It was like you weren't even there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It was just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...If I couldn't find the decorations, then your wish wouldn't come true. The holidays are supposed to be a special time for children, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But none of that was your fault!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Plus... I couldn't buy you a present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>A present?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You've been so good this year. I wanted to get you a present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I left you behind...just like that. But still, you protected everyone. You really are a good person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I know how much you love the winter holiday. I just wanted to get you a present that would make you happy. I owe you that much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...So that's what was on your mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>*sigh* You're always so big and boisterous. I didn't know you had such a sensitive side to you. Come on, you didn't need to worry about something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But I said it to you before: It must be nice to have something to look forward to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Yeah, she's always been like that. She's definitely on the nice list. I bet she'll get some amazing presents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It must be nice to have something to look forward to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...Huh? You were talking about presents? You should have just come out and asked me what I wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>And then I could have told you: as long as we're together, that's good enough for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>After all, the holidays are about spending time with those you care about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Ishi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...I told you, remember? No distractions. Come right back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...I'm sorry. I got distracted when I found that boy, and I didn't come right back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Come on, that wasn't a distraction. That was a part of the job! It's thanks to you that they got the decorations back and completed their snow sculpture. You really brightened his day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>And you came right back afterward. That's more than enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>...You've really grown, Ishi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Not really. I've always been taller than you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I didn't mean it like that. I meant that your eyes are like perfect little knotholes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...!? What does that even mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Those two look like they're enjoying themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Isn't it great, Ravina? I know you have a soft spot for those two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>It's plain to see how much they care about each other, but they still had trouble communicating their feelings...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>...But in the end they managed to talk it out. All's well that ends well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Happy winter holiday to all, and to all a good night!</td>
</tr>
