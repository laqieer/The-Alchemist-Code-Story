<td>All that's left is the wind core!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>All right! Let's follow through with the promise we made! We are going to be the ones to finish off the dragon and save this land!</td>
</tr>

<td>004</td>
<td>Wind's specialty is funneling power. I will use it to forge this wind into something that can obliterate the fourth and final core!</td>

<td>Tina...</td>

<td>Mocca, get set! You, too, Tamis! Rega!</td>

<td>Raaaaaaarrrgh!</td>

<td>...! It's...stopped?</td>

<td>011</td>
<td>What's happening? I thought we were finally done.</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...! Could it be Beelzebub?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Beelzebub! That must be it!</td>

<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Mocca... Tina... Am I missing something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's simple. To truly end all of this...we'll have to head to the right place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The right...place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The heart of all cores. That's where we'll put an end to this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So this is where you've been hiding, Beelzebub!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I knew it. Beelzebub is animating the dragon in place of the cores!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No matter. We can purify it now that we have the Wind Matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We'll find a way to coexist with nature, at last! This time... Together... Once and for all...!</td>

<td>Asena...? Why are you protecting Beelzebub?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Why's it...taking the form of Asena?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Are you trying to tell us we don't have what it takes to protect Saga unless we can beat you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's just an illusionâ€”a shadow, and nothing more! We must free Asena from this confinement and let her rest in peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The obstacle we have to overcome to pay for our mistakes and set us on a new path is standing right before our eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This is truly it! The last hurdle to saving Saga! The future is brimming with light! Let's grab hold of it with our very own hands!</td>
