<td>...That is all for the damage report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Nothing of exceptional value was lost, and the overall structure remains sturdy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The engineers suggest removing the flammables in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hmph... Whose idea was it to stack them along the tunnels anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>P-Pardon me for the interruption, my Queen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Spit it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>W-We've lost contact with one of our scouting parties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>They seem to have vanished into thin air!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Use your brain, you witless fool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's obvious those rats are striking at you from their filthy little hidden dens!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So turn their hovels inside out if you have to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Now GO!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Patience, my Queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Only a matter of time before we flush them out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I have enough bad news to report to the Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Red?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I was told she exhibited "restraint and hesitation" in carrying out her objectives to eliminate Emrys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I've placed her under watch and observation for now, but I shudder to think what this could mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Perhaps Berith's symbiosis is still incomplete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If I'm not mistaken, she was the one who met with Emrys first, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What does that have to do with anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>My dear Queen, unlike you, Red has little and less in way of companionship, much less socialization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's only normal she would start to form...attachments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I don't like your insinuations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Perhaps I shall make myself scarce, then. I've finished my report long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>How was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Good. That meddling pistol-spinner will be staying down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Shame. I would have liked to torment her in front of her Prince Charming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ah, well. I shall look forward to dangling the tenuous promise of her life before him next time, when I return from Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Does she ever stop rambling about men?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Drop it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What of Emrys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No corpse. Guess he got away somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Wonderful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well, he couldn't have gotten far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Despite Red's...subpar performance, she still managed to cripple him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Nothing better than prey limping along. Really drives the despair in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Do what you do best, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh, I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ngh... Ugh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(Hopefully that's enough distance from them.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(But...where can I go?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(This mansion seems rather less opulent than expected...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Emrys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Everyone is inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>All right, then. Lead on...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(That place is nothing more than rubble now, but it's worth a shot.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(If I recall, these tunnels should lead to the street adjacent.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(Heh... I was being naive, it seems.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(...Damn, they're coming this way!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>BZZZZ... INTRUDER DETECTED.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What? "Off-limits"? Isn't this private property?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Whatever happened to it? Its occupant didn't mention anything about it being torn down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Look, ma'am, I dunno either. I'm just here t' keep a lookout.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Just leave if ya don't want no trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Why, how rude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>My apprentice's mansion has been reduced to a smoking pile of rubble! I believe I have every right to know why.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Gah! I don't have time to entertain ya, lady! Just get outta here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>BZZZZ. INTRUDER. INTRUDER.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ya got some nerve coming back here, fox-boy. Yer dead meat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>And who's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Err... Another troublemakin' squatter. Wait! That's none o' ya business!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Emrys exchanges a mutual look of suspicion and understanding with the sharply dressed woman, who smiles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You're having him arrested, I presume?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Err... Yes. Yeah, gonna turn him in t' the authorities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>And convict him on what grounds? Simply passing by?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Rather strange that pedestrians can be arrested for anything in Slothstein these days!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...ARGH! Just be quiet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What the?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>A word of advice: learning proper law would be beneficial to your future endeavors at deception.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Let's see. How shall I report this to the authorities?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Public disturbance, I believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>GET HER!!</td>
</tr>
