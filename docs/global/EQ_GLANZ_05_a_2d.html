<td>Good work. Here's your pay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You know, I was a little worried when I heard you two were girls, but I suppose my worries were groundless. Though you could have gotten the job done a little more...quietly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No problem! Pummeled them all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well, we wouldn't have had to pummel anybody had you not drawn attention to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Meh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hahaha, you two really are polar opposites. And yet you two work so well together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, could you two be members of the Unicorn Knights?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Nope. Just a mercenary duo. Heh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>All right then. It's just that I've heard of this group of bandits that have started to make a name for themselves after Wratharis fell under Envylia's rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The leader of that band is a girl, along with most of its members, so I figured you two could be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The bandits that guy mentioned. That was about Izzy, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>She's keeping the Unicorn Knights safe. Izzy is a strong girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes. She is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Even after Wratharis fell, the world was still a dirty place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We all still lived, clinging to this filthy, stained world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We lived on, doing whatever we could to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's that stone you found.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, the key thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Even Anastasia said she had no idea what this is either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I wonder... Would you have known what this is, Freed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Do you regret it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't. I couldn't fight for a country's sake, and I only have bad memories regarding that country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Still, I did like some of them enough to mourn their loss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Okay. Then I'm gonna sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Go ahead. I'm sure visiting graves is no fun for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>G'night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hello, Anastasia. I wish we could have had more conversations together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I wanted to cleanse this tainted world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So I refuse to love or be a part of this stained world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That was what I thought, honestly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But I found something in this world more important than that wish to cleanse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Just like how Wratharis was important to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I've become one of the stains on this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But I have no regrets. I came to tell you that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Just remember. You shouldn't say things like that to someone you've turned down twice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I wonder if you'd consider this the third time? She's someone the world cast away, and I cast this world away. A nice pair, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Anyway, I just wanted to tell you I'm doing fine. I may not come here again, but I did enjoy fighting alongside you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Goodbye... Rochelle, wake up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...Up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Never coming back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Who knows?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well, icky-stickies can keep coming, but Glizzy and I can take them. Heh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>For now, let us get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huzzaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Agh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It's over. Who sent you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I was ordered to eliminate Glanz and Rochelle of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wratharis? We're just mercenaries. We don't belong to any country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You two have something you shouldn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>A relic of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>A relic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The rock?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>He's looking for some key for the ruins. He doesn't even know what it's supposed to look like, but he wants me to find it. Outrageous, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Who knows what he's planning. Could be the salvation of Wratharis. Could be its destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Give up. You're in over your head. You can't even begin to imagine how powerful the people involved in this are. Don't you dare think you can get away withâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Envylia, clearly. Just between us, I heard Wratharis has been messin' around with Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Oh, damn. So now they've made an enemy of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Well, what do you know. We were carrying with us one of the worst stains upon this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>So you were looking for this since that time at the ruins in Wratharis. Something that requires even more subterfuge than Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Have you heard the pulse of the Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Whether you're aware of it or not, it does not matter. This is for the world's sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>For country and for personal belief... I was so done with all of that, and now for the world, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Honestly... This world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>A pretty large-scale operation you've got here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You've got a large bounty on you. These mercenaries were hired to ensure your elimination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Even an experienced mercenary as yourself cannot escape this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>We exist to eliminate those who have encroached upon the secrets of this world's history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Icky-sticky, icky-sticky...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Rochelle, get out of here! I'll keep them occupied!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>There is no escape.</td>
