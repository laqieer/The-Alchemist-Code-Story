<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>This must be Ramproad Mountain. Will I really find Yogi Ku's forge in a volcano like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No, this is not the time to hesitate. Getting Excalibur restored is the only way forward, after all. But still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Lord Zain... do I really have it in me to lead the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How could someone like me shoulder the fate of the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh?<br>Demons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Am I surrounded?!<br>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Still as clumsy as always, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If you keep on standing still, the heat is going to get to you. Let's take them out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Chloe?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Focus on the enemy!<br>Crystal Break!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ugh! Okay!<br>Alchemia Nova!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wow! That shows why they chose you as the next Lord Commander!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'm impressed with you as well! I can't even compare that to how you were before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hehe... It's been a while, Kanon. I'm happy to finally see you again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I've been wanting to see you too, all this time! But... why are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Nobody but our captains knew that I was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>An expedition from the Scarlet Flame noticed you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Lord Vettel remarked how terrible it would be if something were to happen to the world's supreme Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>T-the world's supreme Lord Commander?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hehe... that's just an excuse though. Lord Vettel was so kind to allow me to come and see you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Isn't Lord Vettel amazing? Keeping the nation safe, while also getting rid of the demons...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>and also not sparing any energy to guide the young knights. He's so busy, and still he's so thoughtful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ahh! I really don't have the right words for it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>U-umm, Chloe...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Every knight in the world with a sword in his hands should follow his example! Lord Vettel is truly the ideal knight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You too Kanon, since you're the Lord Commander now, you could really learn a lot from him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh my... I almost thought that you seemed more mature, but you really haven't changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>When it comes to Captain Vettel, you're really just as you were as a little girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>H-huh?<br>W-what is that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hehe. But you know, meeting you has put me a bit more at ease.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So many things have been happening here, one after another...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>and I haven't had time to talk to anybody like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I hear you. You must have had a rough time. Are things going alright with the Holy Guard internally?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, I can say this because I know you, but... it's still a bit of a mess, to be honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That's understandable though. Lord Zain's death was such a big deal that it shook the whole world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>They told the people that he perished in battle, so it didn't quite cause a public panic though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...Has Captain Kudanstein still not been found?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>At any rate, there is no time for idle mourning. Everything depends on Excalibur's restoration!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The recovery of the Holy Guard depends on it as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The restoration of the Holy Sword Excalibur? Is that why you came to Ramproad Mountain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Right.<br>It's said that the forge of Yogi Ku...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>the only place where Excalibur can be restored, must be located somewhere in this volcano.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yogi Ku...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The Tribe of Ku who forged Excalibur, who passed on their craft from generation to generation within their bloodline...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Blacksmith Yogi Ku is the descendant of this bloodline.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I was told that even now, this person will be able to restore Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wait a second! Somewhere in this volcano? So you don't know its specific location?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Well... right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Huh?! Do you even know how vast this mountain is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>And besides, since people are prohibited to enter the mountain, there are no detailed maps either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Do you really mean to find some kind of hidden blacksmith's forge under these circumstances?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>How reckless as it may sound, I don't have another choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>If Excalibur isn't restored soon, Kagura's life is in grave danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Kagura's life?!<br>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I think you must have heard that Kagura is currently sealed inside the Philosopher's Stone Captain Othima had made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>They say that in this state, her life can only be maintained for about one year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>One year...? Since the day Lord Zain died, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Right. We have very little time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>They say that after one year has passed, there's a possibility that the stone will lose its power, and that Kagura will stay sealed, turning into stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>We cannot free Kagura from the stone without the power of Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>But all this time, we couldn't find the whereabouts of Yogi Ku's forge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It was only recently...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>that someone discovered a note from Lord Zain, saying that the forge is located here at Ramproad Mountain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I see...<br>I suppose you must have arranged immediate reinforcements?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Well...<br>I did tell the other captains, apart from captain Kudanstein, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Oh man... Why is it always so troublesome whenever I team up with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...! Does that mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Yeah, I understand the situation. Time is running out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Let's start looking for the forge immediately! We're not going to let Kagura die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Thank goodness! Don't worry...<br>With you by my side, things will definitely work out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>We'll definitely get Excalibur restored!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Pant... pant...<br>It's really hot in here though. Even just walking is getting me exhausted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>And moreover, we don't even have a clue where to start looking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Is that you, Lord Commander Kanon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I welcome you!<br>My name is Spica.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I'm in service of Yogi Ku, and I guide people through the mountain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You've come to receive me? But... how did you know I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It had come to our ears as well that you were assigned as the next Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>We expected you to show up sooner or later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Which means you knew we entered the mountain? You were watching us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hey, Chloe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Please don't take any offense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>As you know, Yogi Ku's craftsmanship is a treasure beyond comparison.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>These are all protective measures to make sure his craftsmanship will be passed on to further generations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Lord Zain never even told his most trusted captains about this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Considering its importance, I think it's only natural.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>It's okay. Yogi Ku was a private master blacksmith exclusively known to the Lord Commanders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>It would be unthinkable for anyone unrelated to even know his name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>We can't just leave it at that. She may have been eavesdropping on our conversation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Hey!<br>Isn't that a rude thing to say to Spica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Don't worry, she's not a bad person. I can tell by her eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>By my eyes?<br>My eyeballs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Oh, no... That's not what I mean!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>You can see a reflection of someone's character in someone's eyes. I meant to say that I could see whether you're a good or a bad person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>...Someone's character in one's eyeballs...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Does this seem like a bad person to you? Chloe, please trust me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>All right, all right.<br>My apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>That's okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>But actually, it's calmer than I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Ramproad Mountain, I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>It's definitely hot here, but...<br>Considering this place is forbidden territory, the volcano doesn't look like it'll be erupting any time soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>The reason why it's forbidden territory, is because of the gas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>The gas?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>It's not too bad here, but there's volcanic gas everywhere in the area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>It's not a place where living beings can possibly live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>That's strange... Considering the difficult environment, why do those guys keep on showing up one after another?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>You mean, the monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>T-that's because... they have such a tough body, that they can withstand these severe living conditions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>That toughness makes the monsters here incomparable to the ones elsewhere, so please don't be careless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>There they are!<br>Spica, please stand back!<br>Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>On it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>What? Do you mean to take on these monsters with just the two of you?! Where's your allies?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Don't you have others from the Holy Guard coming to aid you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Ugh... I-I don't know! At any rate, we don't have a choice but to make it through this alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Huh?! Didn't you say earlier that you told your captains?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Chloe! I'm not sure if they'll come! Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>What is that supposed to mean? How could they possibly ignore the Lord Commander's orders?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Don't tell me that Lord Zain's death disturbed the order among the captains!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Excalibur is the symbol of ultimate justice! Restoring it should bring everyone in accordance again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I don't have a choice but to risk it all on that!<br>Whoaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Huh? What is that supposed to mean? Whoaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Is that Alchemy? I didn't expect such a terrifying power from her appearance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>That shows why they chose her as the next Lord Commander. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Kanon, behind you!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Huh? W-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>She does have a foolish side about her. Is she really the one inheriting Excalibur?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>W-what was that just now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>W-wow...! That was amazing! Thank you, Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>No, that wasn't me.<br>Spica, was that you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>M-me?! There's no way I could have done that! It must have been him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Whoooaaaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>This place is so hot! I got lost, and arrived later than planned! Forgive me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Captain Monzein?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Geez... How can you guys be idling around like that in this heat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>You should cultivate some more self-awareness as the Lord Commander! You can't get yourself in trouble with this little scum! Geez, it's so hot here!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Captain!<br>You really came!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>“We'll restore Excalibur, and release Kagura from Othima's Philosopher's Stone.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Weren't you the one who called me to action like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Come on, let's take care of this little bunch and get going!</td>
</tr>
