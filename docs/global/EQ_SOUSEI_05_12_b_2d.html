<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I've got you now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My hands are shaking as I grip my shield. My heart feels like it's faltering. It's taking everything I have to just stand here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I won't let you go any further!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I will hold this shield with these trembling arms and legs, no matter what it takes. I will fulfill my duty this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh shield bearer, look how your legs tremble. Do you intend to disgrace the battlefield with your presence again? Do you yearn for death so terribly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sorry, but I'm not planning to die any time soon! And neither am I going to let any more people die at your hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I will stop you this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hah, how interesting. All right, little girl. Show me what you can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...Relax. Look ahead. Keep your eyes on what is important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Unconsciously, my body mimicked the movement of the knight that showed me the way forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Those movements... Is that...Andechs?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If I am lacking, I simply have to use whatever I am capable of! No matter how crude or unrefined!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Daphne figured it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>"We are the ones who embraced Envy—"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(This shield... I know it. I understood it the moment I touched it. It is the same as our Silver Shield, in every way.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(That means there's only one thing left to do. Fulfill the responsibility that I inherited from those who came before me...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It is time for me to do what I was meant to do! The divine protection of the Silver Shield, bestowed upon us by the Mesarthim, the first Shield Maiden!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Madness! If you do that at this distance, then you too will—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>"My body is a shield, a silver barrier that blocks and breaks all that attempt to cross it." Silver Shield, grant me the power to vanquish my foes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>A barrier of magil! You think this will break through my corruption?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Rrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That ability...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(It's the same thing Ignacio used to get away from us in the Gula Belt...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(As expected, the Ira Belt is connected to the Infinite Serpent somehow!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>First, we have to deal with the Cursed Beast, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I did it? I... I did it! The shield finally...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's too soon to celebrate, unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ah, yes! We must save Andechs and the others from that Cursed Beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Our guests have a way to send you to the Leviathan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Isn't that right, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, we can leave immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Right, Mira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hold on a second, I'm trying to connect to Nyx—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Eyo, one two three, test test. You hear me, Nyx?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Whoaa! That was one hell of an impact! I nearly fell over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Then sit down and shut up, would you?! Shoot, the magil conversion rate is dropping?! Oi, Nyx, what are you doing? Nyx? Nyx?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hey, Nyx? We're a little busy here, so can you stop spacing out?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Damnit! And just when we were about to reach the border too! That beast is going to overtake us at this rate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wait, Adaleigh... Mira's sending us a message from Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh? You want to make a connection between the castle and us using Space-Time Manipulation? Are you serious? If we do that the load on Libra will—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What?! You already started the ritual?! Hold on, could you wait for just two seconds?! Haaaah... Okay, I'm mentally prepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...Um, what's with the foreboding conversation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I gave up. She's always dragging me around by the nose, that sister of mine... "Space-Time Manipulation: Connection Initiated."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>"Libra has granted us control. Analysis of surrounding magil: complete." Okay, I'm ready to jump anytime!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Daphne, are you ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes! I'll do my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Don't mind how weird it feels, 'kay? If you shift your magil around too much we're going to land somewhere way off course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>W-wait, what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm leaving it in your hands. Please give our citizens the chance to dream of tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Of course. We will do whatever we can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
</tr>
