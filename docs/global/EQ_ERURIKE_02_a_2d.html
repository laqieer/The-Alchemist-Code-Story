<td>Are they mementos? Oh... I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>The will...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>That's why you're getting rid of the bandits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yes. We cannot allow evil to dominate our desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Allowing that would be the same as disgracing the honor of our comrades who died in this desert.</td>

<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hey. Are you listening to what I'm saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>Hm? Are you blushing? I guess I should write a memo that the deputy captain of the Sand Hawks gets embarrassed quite easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hey! You...tsk. More importantly, we've finally arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Huh? Oh...an oasis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>There should be a small resting lodge for caravans. It should be enough to cool down—</td>
</tr>

<td>Wait, get down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Yeah. It seems like we've stumbled upon quite the prize. Who would've thought that the oasis lodging was the entrance to their hideout?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>It'll be dangerous to get close, right? What should we do? It's almost night. At this rate, we'll freeze to death!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>No. Actually, it's perfect. If we can use their supplies then it'll make things a lot easier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Besides...it definitely won't be a waste of time to get information about their hideout.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>What do you mean? If we steal their supplies, doesn't that make us the same as them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Far from it. All we're doing is taking back what was stolen, a little ahead of schedule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Their guard is down now. This is our chance!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Sorry, but you'll have to sleep for a while.</td>
