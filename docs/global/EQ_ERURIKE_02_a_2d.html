<td>Crush them! If we waste any more time, their rear army will show up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Tsk. With this many of them, it doesn't seem like I've brought enough men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>U-um...excuse me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Sorry, but we'll talk later. Right now, we must focus on getting through this barrier and regrouping with the Guild Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Just look at it...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Look at what? What are you...huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>A sandstorm?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tsk. We're out of time! You lot, fall back! Just take what we have now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Th-they're running away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They must've been planning on escaping under this sandstorm from the beginning! If we get separated from the others, it'll be no laughing matter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, no! My hat...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>He-hey! Young lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Tsk! I'll go! You lot take the rest of them and rendezvous with the Guild Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Um. Where am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You've awoken, young lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Just know this; we're currently lost in the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I got caught up with chasing you and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, my hat! What a relief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I was just explaining why you should be the exact opposite of relieved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>For starters, what were you thinking? You risked your life for a hat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This means more to me than anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Enough for you to risk your life on it, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Save that kind of talk for when you're mature enough to look after yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hmph. Are you trying to say that I'm not mature?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Do you think someone who goes running off into a sandstorm for a hat is mature?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't you understand that it's out of sheer luck that we're still alive?! Don't underestimate the desert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You're right. I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Life is a gift. Try to value it more in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Um. I'm really sorry...for the trouble I caused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It would've left me with a bad aftertaste if someone I met ended up lying dead in the desert the next day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hmph. Anyway, there's no point in hanging around here any longer. Let's move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What? But wouldn't there be a higher chance of us being rescued if we waited here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Under normal circumstances, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>However, there are bandits in this desert. If we were to run into them now, it would be difficult to escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We should at least find a place to hide or else there will be no comfort in waiting to be rescued.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Right. Shall we go then, um...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm Balt, young lady. I'm the deputy captain of the Sand Hawks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You can call me Elrike! I'm a merchant from Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Elrike...huh? All right then, follow me. We'll begin by walking straight across the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well...I guess we're still walking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What are you muttering about? Don't waste your energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Talking stops me from being tired and worried! By the way, Balt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>How much longer do we have to walk for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It may be a desert, but it doesn't mean that the sand continues on forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>This area used to be a fertile land. But Gluttony has long exploited this place, ultimately turning it into its current state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Look at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huh? Oh...it's a plant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>North of this desert, water still courses underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That's why you can see deep-rooted plants like this still surviving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>If we pass here, we'll find a source of water—an oasis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>He-hey, wait! My notebook...ah, here it is. I need to write this down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Huh? What're you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Well, it's valuable information. Does everyone from the desert know about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It's common knowledge that's essential to surviving here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I see. I didn't know about that. When you say survive, does that mean you've lived here all this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yes. As a band of vigilantes who protect this desert, our services have been extensively utilized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Is your outfit part of the caravan you belonged to or your sigil as a mercenary? That chain on your right leg really stands out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It's special—sort of a way to identify a fellow Sand Hawks member.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Each of these is a memento of my fallen comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>They have a pretty important meaning in addition to that as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Are they mementos? Oh... I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Don't apologize. Dying isn't the end. We carry on the will of the dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>The will...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>After our water was stolen by Gluttony, we have protected this desert in order to witness its rebirth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Even if we aim to regrow the trees and the plants...in a land as unsafe as ours, neither scholar nor workman and especially no merchant will come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Our will is to bring back the trees and plants to this land...to build an oasis on our own without borrowing the help of Gluttony who robbed of us our water in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>That's why you're getting rid of the bandits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Yes. We cannot allow evil to dominate our desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Allowing that would be the same as disgracing the honor of our comrades who died in this desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Tsk. I'm speaking nonsense. Forget about what I said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>No! It's not nonsense! It's beautiful. I can feel the bond that you have for your comrades, Balt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Stop. When you put it like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>People who are dedicated to their convictions are really amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I'd like to believe I have my own convictions, but there are times when I stumble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Hey. Are you listening to what I'm saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Hm? Are you blushing? I guess I should write a memo that the deputy captain of the Sand Hawks gets embarrassed quite easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Hey! You...tsk. More importantly, we've finally arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Huh? Oh...an oasis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>There should be a small resting lodge for caravans. It should be enough to cool down—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Wait, get down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Ah. So this is where you were hiding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Hey...is that the leader of the bandits who attacked our caravan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Yeah. It seems like we've stumbled upon quite the prize. Who would've thought that the oasis lodging was the entrance to their hideout?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>It'll be dangerous to get close, right? What should we do? It's almost night. At this rate, we'll freeze to death!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>No. Actually, it's perfect. If we can use their supplies then it'll make things a lot easier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Besides...it definitely won't be a waste of time to get information about their hideout.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>What do you mean? If we steal their supplies, doesn't that make us the same as them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Far from it. All we're doing is taking back what was stolen, a little ahead of schedule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Their guard is down now. This is our chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Oh, Balt?! Se-seriously!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Heheheh... That's quite a catch we had today as well! ...Huh? Y-you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Sorry, but you'll have to sleep for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>We're gonna take them all out before they realize it. Then we sneak into their hideout!</td>
</tr>
