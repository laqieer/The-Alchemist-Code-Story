</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>

<td>Yes. We cannot allow evil to dominate our desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hey! You...tsk. More importantly, we've finally arrived.</td>

<td>Huh? Oh...an oasis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>There should be a small resting lodge for caravans. It should be enough to cool downâ€”</td>

<td>Wait, get down!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Yeah. It seems like we've stumbled upon quite the prize. Who would've thought that the oasis lodging was the entrance to their hideout?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/erur.png" alt="Elrike" height="128"><br>Elrike</td>
<td>What do you mean? If we steal their supplies, doesn't that make us the same as them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Far from it. All we're doing is taking back what was stolen, a little ahead of schedule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/balt.png" alt="Balt" height="128"><br>Balt</td>
<td>Their guard is down now. This is our chance!</td>
