<td>What do you need to confirm? If it's my cooking skills, I can show you right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...I heard a rumor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>A rumor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There have been sightings of demons coming and going from your home…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Even if it's just a rumor, I have an obligation to investigate. That's why I'm here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>... I see. Well, I'm afraid cooking is the only thing on my mind. I don't have time to mess around with demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's what I thought. I had to make sure, given my position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Suppose the rumors were true? Would you have to kill me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…It's not my place to decide. I'd have to consider the will of the people, first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm asking what you would do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Me? I'm not sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>To be honest…the people are sick and tired of fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Nobody knows when it will end or how many more sacrifices must be made…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's why the rumors about your place gave me a glimmer of hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I thought, "Perhaps there might be a way to peacefully coexist after all."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>…Do you mean that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes, I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>However, no matter how exhausted we are, there are still many who wish to eradicate all demons--too many lives have been lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I still believe there's a chance we can live in harmony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Would all our sacrifices have been in vain? Not everyone is as forward-looking as you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>…But what's the alternative?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I don't know… It's a treacherous road no matter what we do. That much is certain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…Even if the road is treacherous, someone has to take the first step. Don't you think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Are you prepared to carry that burden?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...Mitsuha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You and I do not share the same position. I am the one who must carry that burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Even I appreciate the value of life… But my lack of power has caused many lives to be squandered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's why...I want to choose the right path. I've been thinking this way for a long time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Mitsuha …</td>
