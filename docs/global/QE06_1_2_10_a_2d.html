<td>Your movements should be severely restricted within this force field. Which means even I can take you down.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Damn you humans...</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That is an order.</td>

<td>It can't be helped, Amane. Those three are ridiculously strong. Stronger than we are.</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I know that, but—</td>
