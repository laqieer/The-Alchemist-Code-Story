<td>Hey, you guys, isn't it about time for our characters to be released?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>Indeed. To think we've been passed over so many times already. Even those Blade Fox Corps demon slayers got in ahead of us, and they're from far later in the tale!</td>
</tr>

<td>Could it be, perhaps, that we've been left on the cutting room floor, as it were?</td>

<td>Perish the thought! Our time is surely nigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>After all, virtually the entire main story's cast has already seen release. We must be approaching the front of the line by now.</td>
</tr>

<td>Yes. Yes, I suppose you're right. They've even added the Lizardman, for goodness' sake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>Quite right. And there's no way we're less desired by the masses than Lizardmen, so fear not! It's only a matter of time.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>Summons, huh? Perhaps one of us could even be a guaranteed Summon. Imagine that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>That could happen. Or maybe instead, there could be a single-use Selector Ticket where the poor soul is forced to choose only one of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>Oooh! So one of us guaranteed, but you won't know who until you draw? That'd sure be something!</td>

<td>I'll say! I'm getting fired up just considering the possibilities!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>Of course, all of this is only if we get added.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>It'll happen! Mark my words! I swear, Neville, all you do is worry. It's simply foolish to think that they wouldn't add us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>I'd like to believe that, truly. But I can't help feeling anxious. What if...everyone's forgotten about us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>Hah! Inconceivable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>But how can you say that? We've barely had any screen time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>The time we have been given most assuredly left a lasting impression, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>What makes you so confident about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>Well, consider this: every time a user starts up the game with a less than optimal signal, they're presented with lore-rich backstory, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>Game? Is this a game to you?! Ah, but I suppose it's too late to pull back the fourth wall now. At any rate, you are correct: there is much backstory to be had. What of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>When that backstory is displayed, there is sometimes a picture of our concept art accompanying it, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>That's true, there is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>......</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>Well, there you have it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>That's it?! Your confidence comes from that alone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>Hmm, he does have a point. Having us feature there is a rather big deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>It's really not, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>How can you say that? If you wish to play this game, you have to go through us first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>I doubt most people are even looking at their screens when that picture displays, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>Nonetheless, if you can secure a position like that right from the get-go, I'd say you've already won the battle! And the war can't be far behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>Like owning land in Roppongi since before it became prime real estate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>Again with that fantasy world of yours! There's no such place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>Anyway, what I'm saying here is that there's simply no way the powers that be have forgotten about us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>Perhaps not, but they may very well be looking down on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>Let's say, for argument's sake, that Caesar is correct, and we have not been forgotten. If that's the case, would this late release not indicate that we're being looked down upon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>If we are, then I dare say it's your fault, Neville.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>What? Why me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>Because of the tutorial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>The tutorial?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>In the tutorial, you're introduced as having been specially schooled by Vlad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>Yes, that's...correct. But what of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>This suggests to players that you are a top-tier fighter—virtually unbeatable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>Stop, stop! You flatter me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>Oh, I assure you, I do not. For though you are built up so much, you are then immediately bested by a couple snot-nosed kids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>Pardon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vlad_new.png" alt="Vlad" height="128"><br>Vlad</td>
<td>Ah, that's very true! I couldn't believe it myself; all that training amounted to nothing in the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nevi_new.png" alt="Neville" height="128"><br>Neville</td>
<td>That's par for the course in this sort of story! I was a tutorial boss! That's not going to shape the players' perception of us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/caes_new.png" alt="Caesar" height="128"><br>Caesar</td>
<td>I disagree. If we are looked down upon, I can think of no better explanation as to why. Think back on it good and hard, and I'm sure you'll agree.</td>
