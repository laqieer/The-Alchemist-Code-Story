<td>Take this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Do you guys see anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh no, this is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Torn and tattered, Roxanne's clothes lie in ruins on the forest floor, riddled with vicious teeth and claw marks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I... I can't believe it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This can't be.... hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>A nearby bush shakes momentarily, then stops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What was that? Another monster?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The bush shakes again, more violently this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Why you... This is for Roxanne!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>AHH! Stay back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Woahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Don't... don't you dare come any closer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That voice.... ROXANNE?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Roxanne! You're alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Why didn't you say something earlier, we thought the worst had happened!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Also, what are you shooting at me for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That is... um... I was in a spot of trouble, and I just... panicked</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, all the monsters are gone, so you can relax and come out now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>AHH! Don't come closer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>... What's wrong with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Um... only Blair can come over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I have... a bit of a situation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Sigh... what are you up to now Roxanne?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This is serious! I'm in real trouble here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Blairrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm coming, I'm coming! You don't have to yell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's terrible isn't it! You have to help me out here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>... how did you even manage to do this to your clothes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What... what is going on over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm not certain but I can hazard a guess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It seems like Roxanne might have lost some... coverage... in her fight with the fight with the monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>... coverage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(Don't think about it... don't think about it...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Here. It's the spare set of clothes you asked us to pick up for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ahh, thank you Blair! You're a real lifesaver!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Aren't you glad we arrived when we did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Imagine how long you would have had to hide here if we were late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's not my fault! A ratty came out of nowhere and stole my... my top!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I tried to chase it through the forest, but my clothes caught onto every little twig and branch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And when I finally caught up, this huge horde of monsters appeared, I had no choice but to hide!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It was absolutely horrid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Sigh... you shouldn't have just casually entered the forest alone then. Couldn't you have taken Shion with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ugh......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Anyways, I'll go shoo away the boys so that you can get changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Come on, let's go wait elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Fufufu, be careful Miss Roxanne, you wouldn't want to lose another article of clothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Grr... no one asked for your comments!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Later, on the way back to the beach...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>And that's how you guys ended up setting up a beach stall?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Indeed. And it wouldn't have been possible without Eira's magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That's amazing! It sounds delicious Eira, you're going to have to make me one the moment we get back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ehehe! Eira... make sweet snow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>As a reward, you can have this popsicle in the meantime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yay! *munch* *munch*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Umm... isn't that already her third sweet in the last ten minutes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hush! Shion's got the right idea, quick get my camera!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Sigh... I want to get to pamper her too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It's such a shame we're going to return home tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's surprising, I figured you would have had enough of the beach by now, especially after what happened this afternoon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Ugh... don't bring up that dreadful incident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But still, it was really fun while it lasted! Shame you two couldn't have joined us sooner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Ufufu, and possibly spare her some major embarrasment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Shion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>From off in the distance, the gang hears the faint panicked cries of a certain troubled elf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but we've run out of shaved ice for the time being!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>And your other order... Um... two boxes of takoyaki... or was it three?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Ahh, and I left the flames on high for too long!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Where is everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Big Sis... in trouble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Uh-oh, I completely forgot that we left Morrigan on her own...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Help... Big Sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Morrigan? Is that who Eira was calling Big Sis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Eira has a sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Hahaha, come on, I'll introduce you to her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Oh, but before that, could you do me a favor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Could you help us take a picture together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I'd really like something to remember this eventful summer with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Sure... but, the others look busy right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>That's alright, you can just take it as is. I think it'll be much better this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Well, if that's what you want... say cheese!</td>
