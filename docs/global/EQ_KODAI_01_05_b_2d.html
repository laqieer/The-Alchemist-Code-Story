<td>Wh-what...are they?</td>

<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>What?! Impossible! As Ophioneus explained it, humans are to be the rightful inheritors of our future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Not this writhing mass of... Wait. The quality of the magil within this lot is impressively pure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Not even comparable to what we dragons have at our disposal, of course, but still far superior to the monsters found around these parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>They had once been criminals guilty of committing grievous sins. Some admitted their crimes, while others denied them. Some begged for forgiveness, while others accepted their fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>And regardless of all that, this is what they all became. Those guilty of sin have deformed into these vile creatures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Is this some special quality of humans? Do they all do this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Apparently not. I showed one of my trusted students this, and he said nothing like it had ever been seen in the world he came from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>This phenomenon evidently occurs only in those humans who've come to this world specifically, like a contagion spread among them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>It's...a disease?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Perhaps not in the literal sense. I have reason to believe our failures in world creation are at the root of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>You're saying the world itself is poisoning the humans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Exactly. Which is why I can't just be sitting on my hands here. I must find a way to cure those who are affected. I need to devise some means of protecting my people from this corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>But in order to do that, I need time. No matter the cost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Claybelle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>So I hope you understand, I haven't a moment to spare helping you with...whatever it is you're dealing with. I have zero interest in Ophioneus' various whims in general.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>You should leave, inheritor of the dragons' honor. There is nothing here for you. You'll find only humans, plus a heaping helping of my will to keep them safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>You, who don't even care to understand the humans, much less protect them, have nothing to gain from this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Fine. You wouldn't mind me looking for Lil in the town, though, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>As long as you don't cause any trouble. This is my town. I will not permit any harm being brought upon my people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Haven't seen his face in so long, I forgot how much he loves to brood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>He was genuinely on edge this time around, though. Tormented, even! Ophioneus must really be digging his claws in on something or another. Seems like a royal mess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Now, then, I'd best get back to developing some method of purging this corruption...</td>
</tr>

<td>Fallen? Even this far back in time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>This is the first recorded instance of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>This Stratum, which would later become known as Luxuria Belt, represents the very first sin humanity fell to: Lust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>As such, it spawned sinful magil sooner than any other region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Though that could be considered a saving grace, of sorts, with Claybelle residing here. She wished to save her humans, and in a sense, she did. She made it in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/drg_wagi_wiz_01.png" alt="Waginau" height="128"><br>Waginau</td>
<td>She made it? What did she wind up doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>She was the lynchpin, granting salvation from sin through Cursed Beasts...whether she knew it or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
