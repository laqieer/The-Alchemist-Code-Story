<td>Bread.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh, yes, bread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>So it is. Bread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wonderfully so, bread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Vier. I thank you for the provisions, but...can't we have something else sometimes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I like bread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I knew you would, Acht.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's fluffy and filling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Rice can be even more filling, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't think we have enough for those who complain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, I forgot. My lucky item of the day is bread. I just remembered how much I love bread. It's the miracle of modern science how fluffy bread can be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It is quite amazing, isn't it? The yeast multiplies and then they swell...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yeast...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's a type of fungi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I don't want to hear about that while eating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Beautiful, aren't they? All things new... All things old...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Why are our ears so long?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You, a high elven princess, would ask that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Won't you tell me, Ephylinde?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There is no need to cling so close...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hehehe, I don't want you to wander off somewhere without me is all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The most beautiful and rare of things tend to be the most precious and valuable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It is said elves have always been a very delicate people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Especially the pure-blooded high elves, direct descendants of the Great Spirit, who are blessed with near-everlasting lifespans, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Rumors spread that consuming our flesh, our undying and supposedly aesthetically pleasing organs, would grant immortality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hearsay with the same amount of truth as the lies of a merchant hawking "medicines" for enhancing beauty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That is correct, Your Highness. It is a placebo at best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Belief can be a powerful driving force. It has consequences that go beyond mere faith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And so elven organs were coveted and sold at a high price. Some ingested, some displayed as ornaments... And considering the ease of hunting us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We became hounded and slaughtered by those filthy humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And then those giant insects swarming around the village...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>They seem to be drawn to rare Alchemia like that of Philosopher's Stones. They must perceive it as something that will help them evolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The Alchemia of high elves is similarly rare, which draws them in the same way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It is believed that elven ears evolved to better capture the intent and motive hidden within another's words because of having been under such constant threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Because we are a race inherently close to Spirits, we were able to gain some powers which assist in avoiding danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>These powers include divination and fortune-telling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>We then began developing communities over a long period of time in remote locations around the world to avoid being exploited by the other races.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We improved individual magical prowess, and are now able to defend villages through—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I am so bored with this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh, no, I don't mean I'm bored with your lecture. I'm simply tired of studying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Your Highness. It is unbecoming of a princess to leave in the middle of a lecture. I will not allow you to—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hehe, Ephylinde? Who are you speaking to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Whoever you're talking to, it's not me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>H-how?! I-I was speaking to this doll this entire time, thinking it was Princess Ainanna?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>How does it feel to be caught off guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>B-behind me?! Such advanced and precise illusion created in just a moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm over here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>H-how are you behind me again the moment I turn around?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Eheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>More illusions?! I-I will not tolerate such misbehavior, Your Highness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hehehe, now that just makes it so much more entertaining.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ah, n-no! Stop it! I-I will not—! P-points will be deducted! This is not okay! Not okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Class is dismissed, Ephylinde. I'm off to take a bath now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>W-wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You are not free to go yet, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Th-this was a straw effigy this whole time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>During my travels, I met personages from Wadatsumi who called themselves Ninjas. This is Position Shift, one of their arts known as ninjutsu... Or, at least an illusion made to look like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Such perfect timing and skill... You are very experienced with battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It is better for you to know sooner rather than later that I am a merciless teacher. If you are serious about me being your personal tutor, there will be no skipping of class. Or else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Urrrggggh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>And so, Phantom Arts such as this were developed during the long struggle of the elven kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>W-wait, are we continuing our lecture like this?! Even if your student can no longer concentrate?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Elven ears are especially sensitive, and battle techniques that could be used even against each other were developed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>This Phantom Art uses incense saturated with spiritual energy to affect the body through the senses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Heh. After all, an elf's potent magical prowess makes summoning a lower tier spirit to bless the incense a very simple affair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Phantom Arts require very little effort on the caster's part, but also are difficult to manipulate in a way to cause significant damage to their target. On top of that, getting the incense to linger for an extended period of time can be time-consuming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>But as one grows more adept with the art, it is possible to charm an individual, keeping them in an illusion for a prolonged period of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Do you mean like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Heheheh! This is what I call adaptability! And I can give shape to other things with the lingering incense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Well, well. I'm getting a little fired up now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I will now boycott this lecture!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Please be seated, Your Highness.</td>
