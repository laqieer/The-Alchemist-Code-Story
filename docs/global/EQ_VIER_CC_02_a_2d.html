<td>Especially the pure-blooded high elves, direct descendants of the Great Spirit, who are blessed with near-everlasting lifespans, but...</td>

<td>Rumors spread that consuming our flesh, our undying and supposedly aesthetically pleasing organs, would grant immortality.</td>

<td>Hearsay with the same amount of truth as the lies of a merchant hawking "medicines" for enhancing beauty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>That is correct, Your Highness. It is a placebo at best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Belief can be a powerful driving force. It has consequences that go beyond mere faith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>And so elven organs were coveted and sold at a high price. Some ingested, some displayed as ornaments... And considering the ease of hunting us...</td>

<td>They seem to be drawn to rare Alchemia like that of Philosopher's Stones. They must perceive it as something that will help them evolve.</td>

<td>The Alchemia of high elves is similarly rare, which draws them in the same way.</td>

<td>It is believed that elven ears evolved to better capture the intent and motive hidden within another's words because of having been under such constant threat.</td>

<td>Because we are a race inherently close to Spirits, we were able to gain some powers which assist in avoiding danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>These powers include divination and fortune-telling.</td>

<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>We then began developing communities over a long period of time in remote locations around the world to avoid being exploited by the other races.</td>

<td>I am so bored with this.</td>

<td>I-I'm sorry?</td>

<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Oh, no, I don't mean I'm bored with your lecture. I'm simply tired of studying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>Your Highness. It is unbecoming of a princess to leave in the middle of a lecture. I will not allow you to—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Hehe, Ephylinde? Who are you speaking to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Whoever you're talking to, it's not me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>H-how?! I-I was speaking to this doll this entire time, thinking it was Princess Ainanna?!</td>

<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>How does it feel to be caught off guard?</td>

<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>B-behind me?! Such advanced and precise illusion created in just a moment!</td>

<td>I'm over here.</td>

<td>H-how are you behind me again the moment I turn around?!</td>

<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Eheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>More illusions?! I-I will not tolerate such misbehavior, Your Highness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Hehehe, now that just makes it so much more entertaining.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>Ah, n-no! Stop it! I-I will not—! P-points will be deducted! This is not okay! Not okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Class is dismissed, Ephylinde. I'm off to take a bath now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>W-wait!</td>

<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>You are not free to go yet, Your Highness.</td>

<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Th-this was a straw effigy this whole time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>During my travels, I met personages from Wadatsumi who called themselves Ninjas. This is Position Shift, one of their arts known as ninjutsu... Or, at least an illusion made to look like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Such perfect timing and skill... You are very experienced with battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>It is better for you to know sooner rather than later that I am a merciless teacher. If you are serious about me being your personal tutor, there will be no skipping of class. Or else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Urrrggggh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>And so, Phantom Arts such as this were developed during the long struggle of the elven kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>W-wait, are we continuing our lecture like this?! Even if your student can no longer concentrate?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>Elven ears are especially sensitive, and battle techniques that could be used even against each other were developed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>This Phantom Art uses incense saturated with spiritual energy to affect the body through the senses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Heh. After all, an elf's potent magical prowess makes summoning a lower tier spirit to bless the incense a very simple affair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>Phantom Arts require very little effort on the caster's part, but also are difficult to manipulate in a way to cause significant damage to their target. On top of that, getting the incense to linger for an extended period of time can be time-consuming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>But as one grows more adept with the art, it is possible to charm an individual, keeping them in an illusion for a prolonged period of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Do you mean like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Heheheh! This is what I call adaptability! And I can give shape to other things with the lingering incense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>Well, well. I'm getting a little fired up now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>I will now boycott this lecture!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>Please be seated, Your Highness.</td>
