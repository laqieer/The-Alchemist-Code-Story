<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Can I ask you something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Because they're making me train the newbies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why, Vier...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Why do you go about with your skin so...bare?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh? Does it interest you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I've only just joined the Veda Templars. I don't know anything about such circumstances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It tends to make a certain someone very happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I-it does?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm kidding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't mind! You can do what you want! It's none of my business who does what with whom, or how, or... Ah! Uh... Kidding...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>My look, you see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It reminds me that I'm not cold anymore. My heart no longer belongs to a snowy climate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Vier...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Besides, if I dress this way, I can see through my opponents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Where they are looking, what they are thinking, how easily I can manipulate them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>After all, the commandment regarding honesty calls upon us all to not deceive others unduly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wh-what about me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm teasing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's what all manipulators say!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's important to speak plainly to those who are easily manipulated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>After all, that is the best way to make sure the people around you, whoever they are and whatever their background is, are comfortable speaking to you. Don't you want that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I don't understand you yet. It's as though you're mired in fog. You seem innocent, and yet not...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I think you and I are alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>How?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm tired of traveling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ah. I forgot myself for a moment. Please, forget I said anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>After all, we're family now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Heheh... And coworkers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Should we shake on it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Agreed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Please, teach me what you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm not the best role model...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I am a sinner who killed one of her own people and became a dark elf. My existence is steeped in death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm just waiting for the day I die, like smoke drifting from an incense burner. It's not so bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Aren't you lonely?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I've stopped being lonely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I just go on manipulating those around me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Aren't you tired yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Just a trivial little story... A dull story that might not have its own place here and now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I will not let you interfere with these knights who are putting their lives on the line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(Ugh... I don't like this.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(This isn't where I want to sleep.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(If there's anything that could have made me think that way...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(Anything new... Anything old...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(The bonds remain.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(I was holding my breath, waiting for you to say you were tired, too... That you wanted to rest.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Monzein may have gone easy on you because you're a woman, but I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I will not let you interfere with these knights who are putting their lives on the line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Yauras...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Monzein! Don't worry... Leave the rest to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I will witness the end of your walk down the path of chivalry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>(I wanted to bear witness myself as those youths lived out their livesâ€”)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(Finally, after so long, I want to stay awake, and yet!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>And...taking on your resolve...I will become even stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Ugh! Arrghhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Grk... Gah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(I'll be going ahead to the land of sleep, then...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>(All I was able to impart was how to lose sight of one's dreams.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Gah, haa... Haa... Ahhhgh... Haa...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The incredible thing about predictions is that they stick in your head, no matter how it pans out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Nngg...haa... Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>These black ear cuffs I've continued to wear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Each with three triangles reminiscent of an elf ear: the largest closest to my real ear, the next largest angled up like a horn and the smallest placed between each.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I've worn them for so long... For me, for you, and for us... These elf ears worn for three.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I... I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I am...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Bahaha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You feign astonishment well. Not to mention the air of sympathy. And how wonderful you are at affecting delight! Very good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I'm glad I asked you first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>And a master of flattery!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You are the very first teacher I've ever had.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I...am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The first, Eins, was my first enemy. The second, Zwei, did her best but now she is gone. The third, Drei, taught Sieba but turned out to be a traitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>And now the fourth... I suppose for me, fourth time is the charm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Well... I am rather charming. This isn't the first time I've been compared rather favorably to previous partners that were, shall we say, less than satisfactory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Innuendos again? Your mind is always in the gutter...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It's only an innuendo if you make it an innuendo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I-I'm not making it into anything! Wh-why are you getting so close to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Eheheh. I do apologize. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. That would be sexual harassment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>No, it's not that you're harassing me... You're warm, so... It's not so bad in moderation, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Oh, all right. I'll moderate myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hey... Can I call you Vier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I...honestly don't really care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>If I didn't look like this, you'd call me by another name, wouldn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Did you dream well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Ephylinde... Will you compliment me? Ephylinde?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You see, I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I'm a teacher now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I fooled everyone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Only the Veda Templars saw me for who I really am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>They pretended to be fooled and passed the endless night by my side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>They're all utter...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I'm sorry... I'm sorry! Please, I'm sorry, I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I... I can't...sleep, not yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I was a fool! I'll follow after you, right away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Ahahah...hahah...hahahahah... I can barely stand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Just a little longer. Just stay awake a little longer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Naturally. There's much yet to be taught...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>That's enough! It's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>There's no way to undo the Beds of Ice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>So I'll join you right away! I'll join you in dreams until the bugs devour us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>There was so, so much I wanted to teach you. So much I wanted to talk about... So much I wanted you to know... So many fun things, new things, exciting things...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>It's too sad to only know this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>I would have listened to your concerns... I would have taught you all the wonderful things, and all the amazing parts of this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Forget this world! I'm selfish! All I can think about is my own circumstances... The fact that you...and I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Even once the village is gone, you, the lovely princess...queen of the high elves...will sleep on here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I...will?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>If it got out that the queen herself fell and became a dark elf... All the high elves would be shaken to the core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>That's why the queen must sleep here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Here, as the queen who fought to protect the high elves, to protect their purity... Here, you must lay that queen to rest of your own volition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>What...do you mean? I don't want that! If I can't be with you, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>You need not stay trapped by this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I will disguise myself as you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>No! You mean to transform yourself?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Using the vast stock of herbs grown down here and the stores of alchemy built up in the air...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I can create a magical barrier around your best. Eventually my Alchemia will run out, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I make it so the queen rests here among the Beds of Ice, undisturbed by anyone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>And, in turn, I will bestow my visage upon you, with the last of my lingering incense...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>This is the last thing I will teach you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Becoming an adult isn't awful. You can make a place for yourself, earn money to get you by... It can be tough, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>You'll learn so much from it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>B-but people will come to hate the person they think is you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Because I'll be a dark elf... Even Phantom Arts won't be able to conceal it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>You'll give me your form and it will transform into that of a dark elf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>You wanted someone to dream with, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>You, who has watched over the dreams of others for so very long...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>What you really wanted was to fulfil your dreams, be praised, and live out your life before going to sleep, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>You hated the high elves, didn't you? That's why you left, isn't it?! Then why would you do all this for us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>I left the village and immersed my body in battle... I never taught anyone anything. I spent an eternity tricking others...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>My dreams were probably stolen away long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I wanted to connect joyfully with someone out there beyond the walls we have built around our race... I wanted to live a dream of being glad to have lived...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>That's your...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>That's why only you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>After this, my form will be your form...and your form will be my form...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Until my life comes to its end...I will follow the remnants of your magic, bestowing upon you my form and scent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Until your life comes to its end, I will lay here forever in sleep and keep up the illusion of your form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Your...scent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Your scent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Now, open your eyes and rise from your bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Rise?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>This is the end of the lesson. Are you just going to sit there forever?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>But...I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Get up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>(At last, we...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>No... No... Ephylinde! Ephylinde!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>(...will no longer hate ourselves.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Nnngh....guuurghh....Nnnngggghhhaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>You're so unfair! I want to sleep, too! I want it to end, too! It's just a shame!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>I'm...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I'm not lonely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>I'm not! I'll give you your dreams! As if we were dreaming them together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>I'll send visions of your form living on to you in your sleep!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>I'll make sure our mingling scents never part! I'll tie our magic together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Even if you're sleeping, you'll never be bored of your dreams! I will use your appearance to make your dreams come true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>I don't know if I can pull it off... You're not with me, I have no family, I have no one...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>I'll probably want to give up, grow listless, and try and throw it all away in my despair...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>After all, I... Heheh... I've never had the chance to really live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Even so, I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I'm not lonely! As long as I see you in the mirror, and have the scent of your long hair...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>I'll borrow your ears!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Keep your eyes on our dream until the very end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Good night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>I pretended not to know the truth, played to the preferences of the person I like...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>I refrained from the things I thought you'd dislike, fussed over my hair, put on make up, did my nails, practiced smiles in front of the mirror...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Acted naive, but dangled my true intelligence strategically to intrigue you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Met your gaze in the mirror and then averted my eyes, covered my mouth shyly, touched you gently... All of this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Fooling myself... Living greedily on in this form...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>It's like a dream, like an illusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>So beautiful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Eheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Did you learn enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>I learned just how difficult it is to impart one's knowledge to another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>And?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>And...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Even if everything and everything falls apart... It doesn't matter as long as I remain myself, or so I was told.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Even knowing I'd tricked them, they stayed by my side. Teaching me, being taught...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>I began to think I wanted to watch over their lives...and I felt like I had become like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>For the first time, I felt glad to be alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Was it hard for you, being forced to live on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Yes. Yes, it was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>But you never feel it until later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>You never feel glad that you studied hard until after the fact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>That's...true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Good night, Ephylinde.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Good night, Your Highness. What time shall we wake tomorrow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>A good question...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>If I lie on the bed facing upward, I can see the sky. If I lie on my side, I can see your sleeping face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Here in this sweet-smelling, frozen bedroom...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Let us sleep until we tire of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Together, we'll pass the endless night... Together, we'll dream tirelessly...intersecting at the phantom crossroads...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Will that do...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>It will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>For the rest of time.</td>
</tr>
