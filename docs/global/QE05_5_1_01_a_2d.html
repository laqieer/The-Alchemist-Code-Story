</tr>
<tr>

<td>Well, now that is no way to greet someone. Have you no manners?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You ought to show some respect to your king, even if it's only superficial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>Wh-why did you bring me here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis I</td>
<td>To sacrifice you, of course. I mean to follow suit with your people's ancient traditions.</td>

<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>The druidic priestess has always been the vessel in which the Alchemia of the land is collected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You are naturally attuned to Alchemia, even capable of containing the powers of the Sacred Stones within you!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis I</td>
<td>But I must praise them for successfully imbuing a living human being with qualities comparable to my Shadow Excelsior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis I</td>
<td>A heretical deed if there ever was one! Do you not think it only natural that your Sephira tribe fell to ruin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>How dare you! You were the one directly responsible for their fall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hmm, what a powerful glare. Defiance, anger, hate... I can feel them all emanating from you.</td>

<td>Hmph, very well. What use do I have for soldiers in the coming battles, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
