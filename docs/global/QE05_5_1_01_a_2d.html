<td>001</td>
<td>Hmm... Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I-is this...an altar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Rise and shine, druidic priestess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Tell me, how does it feel? What is it like to lay your eyes upon the origins of your decimated tribe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Why did you bring me here?! What are you planning, Ceclidis, you madman?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well, now that is no way to greet someone. Have you no manners?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You ought to show some respect to your king, even if it's only superficial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wh-why did you bring me here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>To sacrifice you, of course. I mean to follow suit with your people's ancient traditions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The druidic priestess has always been the vessel in which the Alchemia of the land is collected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You are naturally attuned to Alchemia, even capable of containing the powers of the Sacred Stones within you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>There is none other than you who can perform this duty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The Sephira... How irksome they have been, time and time again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But I must praise them for successfully imbuing a living human being with qualities comparable to my Shadow Excelsior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>A heretical deed if there ever was one! Do you not think it only natural that your Sephira tribe fell to ruin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>How dare you! You were the one directly responsible for their fall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hmm, what a powerful glare. Defiance, anger, hate... I can feel them all emanating from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Let me hear your lamentations as you are ceremoniously sacrificed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Dear host...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Blood... I need more blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This land of greed must be filled with more tragedy and scorn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The resurrection ceremony... To revive Cryphone, we will require many more sacrifices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We've leveled the entire royal capital and it's still not enough, eh? What a glutton you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>A half-hearted awakening would be meaningless. We will need great power to take what we must from the Holy Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmph, very well. What use do I have for soldiers in the coming battles, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Devour your fill and prepare for the awakening. Try to take as many of our enemies with you as possible while you're at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Have you not caused enough death?! So many of your own people...and yet... What are you planning on accomplishing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Is it not obvious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I will become the supreme ruler of this continent! I have desired nothing else for over a hundred years!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Haaahahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You monster!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(He's mad! How can we hope to defeat such a terrifying monster?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Seriolde... Please, run away! Everyone, you must flee!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The enemy forces are routing! This is our chance to push through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Something is not right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>General? Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This is too easy. Yes, we have disheveled their formations and the desert's climate is on our side, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>These are elite commanders of Gluttony Foss' military. It's hard to believe they would break so easily, under any circumstances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You mean this could be some sort of ruse? Has our invasion of the royal capital been exposed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'm not sure, but it would be best to take precautions. Send a message to every division! Avoid excessive pursuits! Prepare for the enemy's retaliation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The enemy has eased their assault! Now's our chance for a counterattack! General!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>General? May we have your orders?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We've been engaging these desert rabble for three days! If they continue to pressure us like this, the troops' morale will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>General...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hehe... Gahahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>G-General?! What is the matter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Wh-wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The time has come! Children of Gluttony Foss, you will now become the groundwork for my survival!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Wha...? No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>S-stop! No! I don't want to die! Aaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>G-General, look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Tch! Sound the retreat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Leave your weapons and supplies! Just run! Touch that dark mass, and you won't survive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Ceclidis, you monster! You dare sacrifice your own troops like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That was the main force of Gluttony's army! Further invasion of the desert would be impossible without them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>General?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Pull yourselves together! We have no time to waste! Just go on without me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>B-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hahaha! Not bad! Your reputation does you no service, Flame-Armed General!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You're the ones who betrayed the Sephira... And you, Ceclidis! You have my cousin Marie, don't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Exactly! The ceremony can begin at any moment, but we still need more blood! Give us your life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Huzzaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You fool! Did you think spineless back-stabbers like yourselves could defeat me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What are you doing standing around?! All of you, get back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>R-right away, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hahaha... Hahahahahaha! You are the fool, Georgios!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Th-this can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>We are eternal! The strength you pride yourself on is as nothing before our might!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Ngh! You would go so far as to abandon your human form?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Everyone! Save the General!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>No, don't! Stay back, or—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I'll devour you all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Waaaaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>How dare you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hahaha! Resistance is futile, humans! Lay down and become my flesh and blood!</td>
