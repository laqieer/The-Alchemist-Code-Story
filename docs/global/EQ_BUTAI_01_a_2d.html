<td>Hey, Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I swing my blade for the sake of the people and land before me. For the sake of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What is it that you fight for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>To save the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I will tear down all irrationalities and trample over all despair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>For that...I need power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wonderful. I fight for Wadatsumi, and you fight for the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Let's see this to the end...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Tch! There are just too many!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huzzaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This village is done for. There's nobody left alive. Curse you, Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>These were innocent civilians. Why must the people of Wadatsumi suffer like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You should leave this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Kuza?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Take the queen and leave this country. Rendezvous with the Holy Guard and tell them what happened here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tell them that Greed Dike, the nation of avarice, invades Wadatsumi. That Emperor Orion mercilessly slaughters innocents!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That continues to violate Wadatsumi's sovereignty. That we require immediate assistance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I can't leave you here to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I have no intention of getting myself killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>As long as the queen lives, Wadatsumi's spirit will live on as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>As long as our soul remains, Wadatsumi will rise again! Isn't that right, Brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Kuza! I promise you I will return! I will come back to fight with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>So swear to me. Swear that you will survive until then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Take care of the queen. She is the soul of our country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I haven't beaten you yet, Kuza. So promise me...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hah! That's what you have to say in this situation? Your obstinance knows no bounds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Swear to it. Here and now. We will uphold justice, and we'll do it together! We will strike down Orion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>All right. I swear upon my blade. Until we meet again, Brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Back then, I couldn't protect anything. Not innocent civilians, not the queen, not Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I had to become stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I had to be stronger, so that I could ensure that such a tragedy never happened again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I must fulfill the promise I made that day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Tch! What are the captains of the Holy Guard doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We have received reports of Alchemy being misused under the guise of archaeology.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If you have nothing to hide, then you should have no reason to draw your swords.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Your kind are the evil that gnaws at this world. We will crush you in the name of chivalry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Taste the lightning of my thunderous axe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Vice-Captain Monzein! Please do not charge ahead alone. It is highly inefficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Don't worry about it! Just keep me covered!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Honestly, you're such a handful to look after.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We don't have much time. Let's get this over with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Where's the source of this incredible Alchemia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Get back, Seida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>4th Regiment, now joining forces with the 2nd Regiment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>How's it going on your end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We haven't yet found the one with the intense Alchemia! Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>If you won't show yourself, then we'll force you out, whoever you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Wait! What is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>This...this is terrible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>So they were transmuting Philosopher's Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>And this Alchemia... The victims were citizens of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I cannot forgive this injustice. They were entrusted to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Wh-what...is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>There! Look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>This Alchemia... A Phantom?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It can't be...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Chihaya?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Why are you doing this, Chihaya?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You wanted peace for Wadatsumi more than anybody!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>And yet you did this to its people. Why?! Say something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>How dare you! I will not let you bring anymore grief to Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Kudan, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Power... I need more power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You're strong enough as it is! You don't need to do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Come back to us, Kudan! The Kudan who protected me has no need of such power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Th-thank you, Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You just stay the way you are, Kudan. Now, let's go. For Wadatsumi!</td>
