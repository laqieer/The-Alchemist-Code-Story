<td>I didn't expect you to go so far. I hate to admit it, but...your weapons are pretty good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I have to say the same to you. Your weapons are rather well-made. Wait a minute... Is that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're bleeding! Give me your hand! Oh, no! This looks pretty bad...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, this? Don't worry about it. It always happens whenever I forge something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh... I guess I must have been too distracted watching you make your weapons for the first time to notice, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Seeing your hand injured like this when you're such an incredible blacksmith... It makes me sad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Sad? What? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I know you want to make better and better weapons. But if you keep going like this, the day will come where you won't be able to keep making weapons anymore. Your hands are your most valuable asset in this business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's not that easy to find a good rival like you, you know. It makes me sad to think that I might lose this someday...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Your weapons must be sad as well, even more so than I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>My...weapons? Sad? You're always saying such weird stuff, Suiran.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Just give me your hand. I'm going to bandage it for you, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hey... What did you mean by my weapons being sad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Blacksmiths and their weapons share the same soul. The heart of the blacksmith is connected to the weapons they forge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I always take good care of this hammer, because it's an important tool that I need to use when I'm smithing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Lucia, you should treat your hands the same way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Personally, I think that not taking care of one’s tools is a very negligent thing for a professional to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What’s more, I believe that the weapons themselves can sense it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Mind you, I like being lazy whenever I can get away with it, myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Am I...negligent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No, that can’t be true. I'm always thinking about how to improve my weapons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>One day, I'm going to make the perfect weapon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>With your hands all torn up like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Uh, oh! We’re surrounded! Come on, Lucia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
