<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>It's finally quiet now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Seida, tell us what it is that you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The truth is that we the people of Alize have protected the Sacred Stone over many generations. We were bestowed with that fate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...on the request of Gluttony's government.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Didn't you just say that the Alize people and Gluttony have long been at odds with each other?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes, I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's true that have a history of adversity towards each other...but, beneath the surface, we reached a compromise long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wait, are you serious? Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>To protect the Sacred Stone, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Gluttony's leaders our antagonistic, but they're not idiots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>At first, they too attempted to wield the power of the Sacred Stone, but as they continued their research, they realized...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Under no circumstances were they to utilize this tremendous power as a weapon, even against their own enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>However, if the enemy were to become aware of this, they may send their forces to steal the Sacred Stone at any time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's when they thought up...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...the safest place in all the world to hide the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>At first, the leaders of Gluttony came up with the idea of the Alize people protecting it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I mean, nobody would actually believe that they'd hide it amongst their former enemies, would they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But as years passed, eventually this information began to leak out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's when they decided to come up with the next hiding place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Thus, they found the safest place in this entire continent...no, in the entire world...to hide the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wh-where...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Inside the Holy Guard or, more precisely, me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Since when? Since when have you been keeping it hidden?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Of course, from the time I joined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I can't believe it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>How could they place a source of power that could potentially destroy the continent in the hands of someone who was still just a girl...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Seida...I can't even begin to imagine the kind of resolve you must have had in your everyday life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Protecting the Sacred Stone was my tribe's duty as well as our pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>However, our settlement was constantly attacked by those in pursuit of the Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>My father was killed and the chief, my grandfather, was placed in harm's way countless times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>My grandfather was painfully aware that we couldn't protect the Sacred Stone in our tribe any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>He placed the Stone in my hands and sent me to the safest place in the continent—the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>So that's why you joined the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>In the Holy Guard, it doesn't matter where your origins are and they don't ask about your past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Also...the Holy Guard is the most powerful knight's order in the entire continent. There is truly no safer place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So that's that. There's no need to worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>When Waginau figures out that the Sacred Stone isn't inside the ruins. We can take him down together then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>All right. Just like you said, Seida, I think that's the best option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ah, anyway, Seida...I'll give this back to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>My...2nd Regiment...coat of arms...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Well...how can I put it...I completely grasp the resolve you have towards your mission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>But, if that were the case, how come you didn't tell me sooner?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>If you had told me earlier, I wouldn't have said what I said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Seriously. Why don't you try being a little more humble? How about an ‘I was wrong. I am sorry'?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I was wrong...and I...I apologize for my actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Seriously...stop apologizing. It's inefficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But...th-thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huh...?! N-no problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Heheh. You two finally made up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>All right! Now all that's left is for us to find that Waginau and beat him up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hm? No? It's not him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Kagura?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What's the matter, Kagura?! You're covered in wounds. What happened?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Y-you're late...id-idiot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Kagura!!!</td>
</tr>
