<td>Which way are you headed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>To the archives. I want to search through various documents before everyone arrives. There may be some information regarding the Mitsuboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I see. In that case, may I join you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The more minds and hands available, the faster a job gets done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>A Spirit Stone that is said to have been transmuted using methods that are no longer available to this time and age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The mention here of Chakra is the Wadatsumi equivalent of Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hmm. So far, it all coincides with our previous information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...I can't believe it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If the things written in this document are true, then that means Greed Dike's interests are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What's the matter, Lord Commander? Did you find some provocative art or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I see. This cannot be discarded. But how...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The continuation is written here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This...! What good luck! No, it may be better to call this fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. This is what her ability is for...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Desk work isn't too bad on occasion, isn't it, Lord Commander?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Kazahaya...take care of Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Leave it to me, Lord Commander. Wherever she is, I'll bring her to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I leave it in your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>With pleasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Let's ask!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Who are you? You're not from the Holy Guard, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Indeed. My name is Suzuka. I'm a traveling warrior training to become a knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Am I correct in assuming that you are Captain Zain, the renowned Lord Commander of the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's correct...but what of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Prepare yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh dear... You're quite brave coming up from the front.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Of course! As a warrior, I will not fight a battle which I cannot approach face forward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I've fought every warrior I encounter while I made my way here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Of course, I have no desire for unnecessary deaths, so we fought using the back of our swords.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I see...then you were lucky. Or should I say unlucky?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Due to urgent matters at the moment, the most challenging knights are not here. It's a stroke of luck that you've come this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>And, unfortunately, I'm in a hurry, so I don't have time to indulge you. I'm going to end this quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>As you wish! Let's go!</td>
