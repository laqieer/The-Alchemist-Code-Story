<td>Sabareta! So you've brought the Demon here after all!</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>It appears the other one was destroyed by your brother, but I doubt you'll be so successful this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Dias was able to stop it! I promise I will stop it as well!</td>

<td>That one was destroyed before its activation was complete; don't overestimate your odds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We've revived this one with Philosopher's Stones formed by generations of Wratharis blood.</td>

<td>006</td>
<td>In other words, you stand no chance of standing against it.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Tsk! Why would you do such a thing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>For the restoration of Wratharis, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>With the Demon in our hands now, it is no longer a pipe dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>After enduring repeated violations, we will deliver a crushing blow of wrath to this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Don't be an idiot! Do you think you can use fear and power to revive your homeland?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>How dare you speak of such things. Wasn't it your kingdom who used the forbidden art to destroy our homeland?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You speak so righteously. However, Envylia does not even attempt to hide the sins they've committed using power and fear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I...can't answer that right now...but...if we try to work together...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Don't make me laugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Taste our revenge. We'll return the heinous deeds you've done to our country ten-fold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We will destroy Envylia and on its ashes, we will build a new Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Stop!!!</td>

<td>Whoa...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Th-the ground is trembling! Sabareta, is that you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>N-no! Has the Demon began moving on its own?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>W-wait! Ack. Agatha?! I need to save Agatha!</td>
