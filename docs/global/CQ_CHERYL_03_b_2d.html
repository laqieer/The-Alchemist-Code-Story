<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Written notes related to alchemy... Records of past experiments... This is a laboratory disguised as an orphanage, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Gathering children who lost their parents, then building a place to use them for experiements... </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Cheryl! Look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ngh... Where's my older sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't worry. She's alright. She was really brave by helping us find you. We've come to rescue you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh... thank you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hey! Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>She's alright. She's very weak but she'll survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Cheryl? What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The dark area below the lighthouse... The location is close to the Inquisition's Slothstein headquarters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Who would've expected that experiments with alchemy were taking place there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If I'd only noticed earlier, as an inquisitor I could've saved her much sooner...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I had no idea either. To use an orphanage as a secret lair... How horrible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>At least all the children in the other rooms are safe. And we were able to rescue this child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're right... It's great that we could do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And now...to start writing the report on this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hey! Cheryl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>How are you? Working today, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes. There was a lot to do after what happened the other day, so all that's left now is to file the report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It was complicated to write since there were rules that weren't followed, so I'm a bit exhausted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh yeah... But was everything alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I mean, because...you're an inquisitor and went against protocol, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes, everything was fine. I didn't hide any facts and was honest about what happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's great! I'm so relieved... I was worried that I could've gotten you punished for your actions or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You don't have to be worried  It's alright. Unlike me, the Inquisition isn't that strict about the fine details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Actually, my superiors were impressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I think I was just trying to reassure myself by following all of the rules and fearing what would happen if I broke any of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm strict against people who don't follow the law so I can protect people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Even so, I'm too obsessed with following the rules and can't see the injustice that was in front of me... And that should not happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Of course it's important to follow the rules... But we sometimes have to think things beyond the rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Cheryl...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Things went in a different direction, but we were able to crack down on the illegal use of alchemy as a result.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>And most of all, I'm glad we were able to save those children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yup! That's right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hey, look at the time. This time, let's really have lunch together. That spicy place I recommended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh wait, are you in the middle of work, as usual?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yes, as soon as the investigation is finished, I'll have time for a break, so...<br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Actually... Why don't we have lunch together first?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huh? Are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes. My report's not finished yet, but maybe it's good to do something like this once in a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Following protocol is important, but if I'm always following every little rule, I might miss out on something more important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>For example, missing out on a recommended place for lunch with a friend!</td>
</tr>
