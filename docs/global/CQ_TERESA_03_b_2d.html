<td>Lamia!</td>

<td>Ah... Aaah...</td>

<td>Rrraaaahh!</td>

<tr>

<td>Be gone! All of you! Die! Die!!!</td>

<td>Finish them off before the Ruinmaker returns!</td>

<td>...!</td>

<td>When I turned back, the wasteland was overgrown with arrows and swords of the fallen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>An abhorrent sight unfolded before me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Fighting harder than my opponent is the only way I know to end the fighting.</td>

<td>...!</td>

<tr>

<td>Thank you for... For being alive...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You saved me. You kept me alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I didn't do anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I learned from you how to fight when surrounded. Had I not watched the way you fight on the front lines, I would've...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>All I can show you is how to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But that's what saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If I am honest... What I regret most is not taking more time to talk with my father, mother, and my little sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>About dinner, the weather, friends... Anything at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I wanted to share that happiness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But the title Ruinmaker weighed heavily on my soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Nnngh! Aaahh...! I should... I should've been the one to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No! I wouldn't want to see you gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>There is no one who hopes more for the possibility of happiness once the fighting is done. That's why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>That's why I chose you to be my mentor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You will never fade from my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You are my symbol for happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>A jasmine blossom...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It was trampled on and nearly burned, but in the end it was left standing in the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>In the language of flowers, Jasmine stands for "I am very happy."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Heheh... Hahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Master?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Aren't I supposed to be the one bringing you gifts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Well, your idea of a gift tends to be something like a whetstone or a tactical manual...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I thought they'd be useful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Th-they are, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>All right, all right! I'll bring you flowers next time! Lamia, do you have a favorite flower?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...I like shirley poppies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>A shur-ly...? What? Poppy? Shirley poppies? Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Do you really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You don't embellish your words, do you? I got it, I promise! I'll take you to a flower garden full of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hehehehe, I apologize for my rudeness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Whenever you need to escape the horrifying flames that are burning your heart away, you should take a moment to stop and smell the flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Yeah... I'll do that. Even if that's the only time the war will fade from my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It will be like a good luck charm that you can find comfort in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Lamia... I hope you know that speaking with you also helps me forget the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I know. It's the same for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>In a way, I guess that makes you my Ruinmaker.</td>
