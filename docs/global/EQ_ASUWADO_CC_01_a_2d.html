<td>Is that child feeling ill? What happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Probably just drank some dirty water. That's disgusting. She should go around the corner and throw up and not here.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ughhh... Ughhh...</td>

<td>As my consciousness was feeling hazy, I thought, "Oh, I'm going to die."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I couldn't remember the last time I drank clean water. Because of circumstance, I couldn't even sleep under a home with a roof.</td>

<td>Lives aren't lived equally. But why is this how I live...?</td>

<td>Yes, death is the only equality and salvation in this cruel world.</td>

<td>You've found the truth... Now, come with me.</td>

<td>Children. You've faced near death experiences. You cannot live anywhere else. Follow these teachings and only believe the certainty of death.</td>

<td>And as long as you heed our teachings, Zalam Gaim will be a place you can come back to—a place you can call home.</td>

<td>Those accursed teachings were the only escape offered to me when I was on the verge of death with nowhere else to go...</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>S-scoundrels! Criminals! Who?! Who dared hire Zalam Gaim to assassinate me?!</td>

<td>We don't know the identities of our clients. We just complete the missions we're given.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Right. We couldn't tell you even if we wanted to. So why don't you just be a good little target and accept your fate?</td>

<td>Rrg...</td>

<td>H-hmph! Do you have any idea why I've come all this way? Any notion at all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>

<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's what I thought. All you need to know is that I'm not about to just lie down and die!</td>

<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hey—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'll handle these guys. You go after him, Sakani.</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Understood!</td>

<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Stop right there!</td>

<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ugh, persistent little...</td>

<td>Aah! He's got a gun?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hehe. I thought something like this might happen, so I picked this up just in case.</td>

<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Gah! Still more mercenaries?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Looks like the tables have turned, huh? Not even your Najam can save you now. Time to d—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Gaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>M-my gun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Even a state-of-the-art weapon means nothing if you can't hold on to it.</td>

<td>Lady Najam!</td>

<td>C-curse you all!</td>

<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oi, boneheads! Kill them! I'll pay whatever you ask—just get it done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Lady Najam, they look to be quite skilled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Forget it, Sakani. We have only one job here, and it's imperative we complete it as quickly as possible. There's no time for...side projects.</td>
</tr>

<td>Let's go.</td>
