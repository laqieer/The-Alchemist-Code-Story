<td>...So that's how it is. What do you think? Do you understand now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes! You're incredible, Professor Deneb! Astronomy is difficult, but your teaching is so comprehensive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, come now! Such flattery will get you nowhere. Good luck on the next test.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Thank you! By the way, Professor, is that customer still following you around?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Why hold a grudge against you just because your misfortunate prediction was correct?! Please be careful, Professor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Thank you. But I'll be okay. I'm sure it's just his way of blowing off steam. He'll understand eventually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...Sigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That being said, I guess no one enjoys having a misfortunate prediction told to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I wonder if sharing the future that the stars speak to me is truly the right thing to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...Sigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hey, watch where you're going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh! I'm sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(Oh dear... In my absentmindedness, it looks like I've wandered into a dangerous place.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oww... Sorry isn't enough! You'll have to pay a compensation fee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What...but I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Or...will you compensate me in other ways?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(Wh-what should I do?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What are you people doing here? It's not healthy to bully a young lady like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Who the heck are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Jeez...I just got back from training, but I guess I'll have to work up another sweat!</td>
