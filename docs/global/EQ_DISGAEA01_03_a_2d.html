<td>Sigh... We're finally through the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This place... It seems like we've distanced ourselves from the castle town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What? Did we get lost in the forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yeah...but we might still be able to make it if we go all the way around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Sigh... So, we have to walk further? I'm exhausted...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Prinny, carry me on your shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Geez, Madam Overlord, I told you already that it's just not possible! You're too heavy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Agh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hm? That sound...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't worry about it, plip. It's just business as usual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...It would be nice if you were a little worried, dood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hey, get a grip! Let's hurry on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What's gotten you all cheerful suddenly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ah, well, I don't know exactly how to put it. This desolate feeling reminds me of the Netherworld of Scorching Flames!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Scorching Flames... Is that your home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yep! It's the super ultimate Netherworld ruled by me, the supreme one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Let me see... Well, if the earth was cracked and magma was erupting from it while pillars of flame rose to the skies, it would look even more similar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That description alone pretty much sounds like the opposite of this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Enough with the minor details!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>They're not minor at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Heheh. For some reason, I have a lot of fun hanging out with all of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Really, plip?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>By the way, route aside, which direction is the castle town?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hmm... All right! I'm gonna climb that rock mountain and take a look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What? That was incredibly fast... And? Did you see the castle town?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I super couldn't see anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What the...?! You useless muscle-brained monkey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But I did see someone headed this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>A traveler? Perfect. Let's ask for directions to the castle town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...? Wh-wha...?! De-devils...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hey, hey. Calling us devils is super rude! We're Overlords! We live in Netherworlds and rule over demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hyaah?! Sp-spare me, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What's the point in scaring him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ugff...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ah-ahh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Madam Overlord Seraphina, you're scaring him even more, dood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Sorry to have frightened you. We're not nearly as suspicious as we look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>B-but you're O-Overlords...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yeah...but, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>A non-suspicious Overlord doesn't sound very persuasive, dood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huh? I'm Rin. Would you happen to be a peddler?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ye-yes...I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>A peddler...? You wouldn't happen to have any spices, would you? I'd like to take some off your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>M-my sincere apologies! I sell silk fabric, not spices!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Pl-please, just don't take my life!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Don't worry. We're not gonna take your life. I see...so you don't have any.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Well, can you tell us how to get to the castle town?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What?! The castle town...?! Hold on...you don't plan to invade it...do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>No. It's to procure spices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>B-but...you're Overlords, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Sir! Please, let me speak it with him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'll leave it to you, Rin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Mr. Peddler, how do we get to the castle town?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>A-are you really sure it's all right to say? Um... Well, from here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Seriously. What is that jabroni scared about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It's pretty rude, to be honest. We would never even think of invading the castle town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Actually, I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the way you came across...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(A hot, steaming curry...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...Usalia, dood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Huh...?! I was just contemplating why we're alive, where we came from, and where we're going...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You're not really interested in road directions, are you, dood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Yes! All right! Thank you, Mr. Peddler!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Well then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Well then, let's hurry to the castle town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Too bad. If that jabroni just now sold spices, he could've sold some to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>There's no point in mulling over it. You can't make curry out of silk fabric.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Oh...just wanted to confirm, Rin. Can you use HL in this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>HL? Is that some kind of money? No, you can't use it here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Right. One more thing... Rin, you wouldn't happen to have any money on you, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Nope. Nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Right. Dangit. I can't believe I forgot about something so basic...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What should we do?! Even if we go to the castle town, without any currency for this world, we won't be able to buy spices!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Aaaaaghhhh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What was that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Wasn't that the jabroni from earlier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>O-oh...he-help...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>The peddler is being attacked by a Phantom Solider!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Oh dear! Everyone, we must hurry to help him immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Wh-what's gotten into you, Sera? It's super out of character for you to suddenly want to help people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You muscle-brain. He's a peddler, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I'm sure, if we help him...he'll give us a bit of money!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Ac-actually, that's a super plan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Pl-please, help him regardless of profit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Let's put monetary profit aside for now and prioritize his rescue, plip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>All right! The supreme one is on his way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Sir Killia! Please, hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>W-wait...! I'm in the middle of Mushroom Cream Sauce Spag..."!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Although the cream tastes rich, there is a certain smoothness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Enough with the food commentary, dood!</td>
</tr>
