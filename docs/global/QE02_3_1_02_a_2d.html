<td>Hey, hurry up. If you take your time, we'll lose the little lady's trail.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>This ground is loose gravel. We're moving at our maximum speed. Do you want to get carried off into the river?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Tsk. You clumsy fool. My bike could make twice the speed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Say that again, you ungrateful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Stop it. This is Johnny B. Tango.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>His name comes from the almost dancer-like grace he employs when finishing off his enemies. If you underestimate him, you'll get hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Heh. So you're this massive-arm idiot's underling, huh? You've really come up in the world, Tara baby.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Are you messing with me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I was being polite because you're Don's acquaintance, but now you've gone too far! Who do you think it was who rescued you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Shut up already. Nobody asked you to. Go home and dance the waltz or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is what he does. He pushes his friends away to stop them from getting hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But it's not going to work anymore. There's no way I'm gonna let you leave me behind again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Were you intentionally trying to upset us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Seriously. You're giving him way too much credit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>He's not that smart! He hasn't changed at all! He's an idiot, plain and simple! Don't read into his intentions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yeah, Ronnie! This massive arm isn't worth saving!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Don, it's not looking good! Alkaroids are approaching ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Shut up!</td>
