<td>Tina! You can't just keep shooting it at random! We've gotta find a weak point and focus our attaâ€”! Nnrghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Mocca!</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Graaaaaarrrgghhhhh!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What is going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm not sure...but I think it might have something to do with Beelzebub's corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This is bad. At this rate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Actually... If it is the corruption... There is something we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I mean, we took down that dragon, didn't we? This thing shouldn't be a problem for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Okay... What's the plan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, it's focused on me...or, I guess, on the corruption inside of me, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So you've gotta be the one to ram its weak spot. I need you to get it to hold still, even for just a moment, and then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I want you to make a Wind Funnel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A...Wind Funnel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yeah, and you gotta concentrate it on just one area. You're making a funnel for me to send my spear flying straight through its flesh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Just combining our powers isn't going to be enough. We need to make sure that we focus our wind magic on a single point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If we do that, I bet even this giant thing won't stand a chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I see... A Wind Funnel, huh? It sounds like the kind of technique Tamis would use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>All right, it's worth a shot. Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ready when you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hrrngghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Mocca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Tch! Why does this have to happen now?! The corruption's preventing me from forming my wind powers!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(There's gotta be something I can do, but what...? Wait! I've got it!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(But...that'll mean I... No, I don't have time to think about that right now.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(I've gotta protect Tina!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Mocca, what're you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>O Wind, rage upon me now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It doesn't matter if I'm sweaty, if I'm a girl or a boy... The only thing that means anything to me is protecting Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>M-Mocca... You're...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Try not to stare, all right? We've gotta concentrate on taking this thing down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>R-right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So long as I'm cursed with this corruption, I don't think I'm going to be able to use the full range of my powers, but... How do you like this, huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaaaahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Graaaaaaaaaaarrgghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We're gonna defeat this thing together, right here, right now! Get ready, Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Okay! Leave it to me, Mocca!</td>
