<td>Answer me! Who sent you?!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>If you don't start talking, I'll leave you here, and you'll end up as a snack for the monsters of the forest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Vivi, that is enough. I care not who this dog's master is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Let us dispose of him, and go home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>W-wait! This was just a job. I don't have anything against you! I have a wife and children, so please...! Please spare my life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Did I not just say...enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>N-no! Please! My employer is one of your men... That recently appointed Officer! He's filling his pockets with foreign gold behind your back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(So that's what's been going on.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>He resents you, but he didn't want you dead! My orders were to just give you a little scare! That's it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's over. Come on, Mei Fang. Let's let him go, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Aaarrrggghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Nngh... Haaa... Haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Mei Fang?! Why...?! It was over! We could have just let him go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Tch. You always talk about how we are friends, and yet now you criticize me? Or have you simply failed to understand the reasoning behind my actions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>B-but, that's...! He...! I... You're right. You saved me back there, and I just... Haaaa. I-I'm sorry, Mei Fang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You would waste mercy on the likes of an assassin? I am shocked that your organization is so soft. If you do not eradicate those who would do you harm, you risk bringing calamity down upon your allies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wh—?! Hey, don't you think that's going a bit far?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Incidentally... It appears that Wratharis has been poking around my business as of late. I assume that you have been asked to report on me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I will never tell them anything about you, Mei Fang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Why not? At the very least, things that are well known in one nation will make their way around at some point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So what?! That has nothing to do with what I choose to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I am saying that it is pointless to be stubborn about such things! Your concern is unnecessary and a nuisance to me! I do not require your pity!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But you're my friend, Mei Fang!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If you were really as cold and merciless as the rumors say, then when you found me sneaking around on your estate that day, you would have done away with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But you didn't! You listened to what I had to say. It was clear to me that you were a reasonable person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We've seen each other many times since then, and I've grown to like you more and more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I know you're a talented tactician, and that you're feared throughout the nation for your reputation as a ruthless commander...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But I also know that you're a good and kind person, who cares about me as her friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I know that you hate sea cucumbers, and other creatures that don't have feet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I thought I knew you as well as a true friend should...but there's still so much I don't know about you. I see that now. I'm sorry for being so presumptuous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But...I just can't be the one to report on you! It would feel so wrong! It kinda...goes against my nature, so to speak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>V-Vivi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Mei Fang... I swear that I will get stronger—strong enough to protect us both!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So that one day you'll say that you feel safe with me by your side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You are so... Hmph. Are you not upset with me, after everything I just said? You would still...call me your friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Of course I was a little upset, but...I mean...you weren't wrong, and it's normal for friends to fight occasionally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Heehee... Hahahahahaha! You know, you are far too good of a person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What does that mean? Anyway, I'm hoping that if I get stronger, I'll be able to help more and more people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Well, I guess I shouldn't get ahead of myself! First, I have to get strong enough for you to be able to count on me! Training, here I come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>All right! I'm bursting with energy all of a sudden! Hell yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Vivi, what are you doing?! You are headed the wrong way! Wratharis is in this direction!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh?! Oops, that was close!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hmph. How exactly do you manage to function as a spy? You are hopelessly clumsy without me by your side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ahahahahahaha!</td>
