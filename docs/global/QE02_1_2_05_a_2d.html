<td>You know, it's odd.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>The Alkaroids should be powerful enough, but they can't even suppress a single mafia organization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That's gotta be the influence of my master, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Your master...you mean the dead Mayor Edward?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Aye. He used to say, 'The mafia is part of our culture.'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He never intruded too deeply into this district.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>A necessary evil, huh? Well, I don't like how he abandoned the poverty-stricken people living in these slums.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No! It was after Alvarez became mayor that Real Heaven started to deteriorate into a slum!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's only recently that it's gotten this bad, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I see. Anyway, this will be our first confrontation here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I doubt a regular person could win against those droids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Will my master's legacy disappear, aye?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Who knows? There's nothing I can do about it. As an outsider, I can't get involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But, saving Fiona is more important than my master's legacy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I won't forgive the mafia for abducting Fiona! Edgar, let's hurry, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hah. That's the first time you used my name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We need to rescue Fiona before the androids take out the mafia! Brace yourself, Alkemono!</td>
