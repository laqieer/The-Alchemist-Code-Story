<td>Hmmm... What a delicious, buttery smell! I can practically taste it from down here! Isn't it divine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Um... Wh-where are we going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ravina, suppressing your magic uses up a lot of energy, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>R-right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Magic requires mental energy as well as physical energy, you see. Hence, in order for you to suppress your magic, it is necessary for you to keep up your sugar levels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Really? So that's why you're always talking about sweets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Sweets are efficient, and so the logical choice. More importantly, they are ever so tasty. I hope they'll be ready soon—I can hardly wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So...sugar helps you control your magic, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ravina? What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>M-maybe if I eat more sweets, I'll be able to make it through the afternoon without falling asleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well... It's something you're predisposed to in the first place, and everyone has different body rhythms. You don't need to push yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wh-what do you mean, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I do need to push myself. I want to push myself until I can control my magic with ease!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If I can manage that, then I'll be able to avoid causing trouble for you and Michael.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I...I really don't want to cause you two any more trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ravina, don't lose sight of your goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>My goal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sugar should help you suppress your magic, but it's just an excuse, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The main reason I eat sweets is because they make me happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Happy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If all you're thinking about is controlling your magic, or other stressful things, you won't be able to appreciate them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's disrespectful to the divine substance that is dessert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I-I'm so sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm just kidding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey, Ravina? Did you know that it's a grave sin to eat sugary things at this time of night?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>R-really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well, it is terrible for the waistline. That's why I brought you with me—so that we could share the calories. I hope you don't mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh? Why would I? I don't mind at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Wh-why not? I love spending time with you, Lofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hmmm... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>All right. From now on, I won't mind anything you do, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>L-Lofia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Here you go! Freshly baked pancakes with maple syrup for the two young ladies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Wow! It looks so good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Mmmm... I haven't been here in a while, but these pancakes really are the best. Soft, warm, and fluffy, like little clouds of joy—and that maple syrup is just divine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ah...umgf... This is happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Y-yeah! This is...umgf...so good! Delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>These pancakes are just so good. They're making me feel all warm and fuzzy for some reason. Hehe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(It must be because I'm here with Lofia.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(I bet these pancakes wouldn't taste as good if she wasn't here.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(I love her so much. That's why I'm feeling warm and fuzzy. I want to be with her forever!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>All right, Lofia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hm? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I want to get better at controlling my magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Because I... I love you and Michael so much. I never want to leave your side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>But I've still got a long way to go. If I want to keep up with the two of you, I need to try harder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's the spirit! I'll lend you all the help I can, Ravina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Th-thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Well, if you're going to be pushing yourself, you will need a lot of energy. Let's finish these pancakes while they're still nice and warm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Right!</td>
