<td>That sword's purpose...was to help that man live on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>My father forged that sword solely for the purpose of helping him live on...and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It was...all for nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Miuna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Not for nothing, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What are you saying?! That man, he just used my father's sword to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes, but in the end, he was able to remember his true self.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That he was able to remember the values he once held when he received that sword; after a life of regrets... Isn't that proof that your father's heart was able to reach him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I mean... Maybe, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The Yogi Ku that I knew had a greater vision of the world than just what laid before him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>He was the kind of person who looked into people's hearts and could be deeply moved by what he saw. That's what inspired him to forge this sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But if the wielder dies, all of that just...ends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I disagree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It doesn't end unless the people left behind let it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Doesn't...end...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>His dream to end the chaos and suffering of the world with his sword... It's something of a reckless ambition, but if we carry on his will, then it will never die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That will... That heart that Yogi Ku was so taken with...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ah, classic Yogi Ku; to make such an incredible sword by making use of the "other" world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Cadanova...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I will use this sword to carry out Zehn's dreams, as your father would have wanted, and not just me... Right, Kanon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes! I promised Zehn himself that I would, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Do you understand now, Miu? Yogi Ku's efforts were not in vain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Your father was a great man, and his legacy will live on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Y-you're right! Thank you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>W-wait, what? Why are you crying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Grrrrrnghhhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Lord Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Nnghhhhh... Gwa...gwaaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No, it can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It seems that he is close to being completely overwhelmed by the power of darkness. This is...unfortunate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>At this point, I think it's too late. I think...it may have already been too late the moment he allowed the darkness into his body at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Which he did, despite knowing how it would end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Too late...? Meaning that there's no way he can be returned to normal?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Exactly. Now that it's come to this, there's only one thing left to do. We must take him down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Kanon, come. I cannot deal with his powers of darkness without your powers of light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>W-wait, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Zahar, he... He pushed himself into the darkness in order to save us! After that, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That is exactly why we need to do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>He lost himself to the darkness and now has the potential to push this world to the brink of destruction. Do you think that is what he would want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Zahar stood apart from the rest of us, but in his last moments I saw that he was just as committed to truth and justice as any knight of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>He has been my enemy, but I find myself compelled to help him stay true to the justice he threw us away for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If this is the fate he must be left to, I prefer to deal with it personally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Uggg....gyaaahahahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The darkness is escalating more quickly than I expected! Hurry, Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Urk! Hyaaaahh!!!</td>
