<td>Marie</td>
<td>I merely share their lineage. I possess only meager healing powers, nothing at all like the miracles I have heard that they are capable of.</td>

<td>Um, Miss Tina? Did I say something wrong?</td>

<td>Oh, don't worry about her. To tell you the truth, we're looking for the Sephira in this desert as well.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/moca.png" alt="Mocca" height="128"><br>Mocca</td>
<td>So we just got a little excited for a moment there.</td>

<td>I see. So we share the same objective.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/moca.png" alt="Mocca" height="128"><br>Mocca</td>
<td>Not to mention, there seems to be someone after you. You might be attacked again. It'd be wise to have us around.</td>

<td>Well, no, but... Wouldn't you have some qualms about traveling with a noble from Gluttony Foss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Not really, no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I just feel like you tend to have a scowl when looking my way.</td>

<tr>

<td>Well, we did have some conflict with the Gluttony army a little while ago. So I guess we do still have some emotions to work out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/moca.png" alt="Mocca" height="128"><br>Mocca</td>
<td>But we're not so narrow minded as to judge a person by their birth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>That's true. We might've had our grudges and quarrels with Gluttony Foss, but I feel like we got to understand each other in the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>What is this mission that you have to accomplish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>Of course. It would be extremely rude of me to keep it a secret from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>I must tell you of the horrifying monster that dwells in the shadows of Gluttony Foss.</td>

<td>???</td>
<td>So... You lost the Sephira girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>We had a little problem. Some shamans from Saga interfered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>That skill of theirs... They must be retainers of the Great Sprites that rule the Saga tribes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>You know who the desert belongs to. Any half-hearted attempts would only be a waste of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>She is going to be our druidic priestess. If you truly wish for the rebirth of Sephiron, we must have her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>I know. I plan to use the piece that I have kept hidden in the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Hmm. I had thought that you were keeping that to pass judgment upon the traitors who fled to the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>I was, but needs must be when the devil drives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>We have waited a hundred years for this. We will not accept any delays for the resurrection ceremony.</td>

<td>Let Sephiron guide us.</td>
