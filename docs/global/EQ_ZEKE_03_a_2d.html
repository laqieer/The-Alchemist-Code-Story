<td>Arghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...Seems like that woman got away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Inform all the knights! Have the castle completely surrounded, and don't let a single soul escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You fiend...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Magna Code is absolute. Moreover, if we leave any of Wrath's royal family alive, it will definitely give rise to new conflicts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We will exterminate every single root, however little blood connection there may be. If that's what's required to stop this war, we'll see it through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Is that... is that really your sense of justice?! That's a horrifyingly chilling sense of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Blood Wolf Zeke... I will never ever forgive you for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>My soul will take roots of Wrath in these lands... until the next generation of Wratharis summons me back to their cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And when that day comes... I will definitely punish you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I will see this justice through. I will utilize this Power, for the sake of a peaceful world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This is the woman from before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It looks like she fought the Holy Guard while simultaneously defending her king. She was able to take out so many, all by herself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...She already died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Both you and me have killed a lot of people for the sake of protecting what's dear to us. That truth will never change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Did I just hear something from beneath the cape of the king?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>W-waah! Waah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>A baby?<br>You really chose the wrong era to be born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Mm... mommy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(Laughter?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hee-hee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What innocent laughter...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Heehee.. mommy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Was I really about to raise my sword against a baby? What on earth have I been doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Covered in blood, murdering a smiling babe... could that really be peace?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Darn it... Have I really been envying and using this kind of Power?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The future I strive for... the peace I want to build... does not involve terminating this laughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>This Power is too dangerous.<br>I... should not have it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I should not use it ever again!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(That moment, on that day... I was saved by the baby in my arms.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(It wasn't my life or my honor that was saved. It was my soul, rather.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What's the matter?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I've come to report! A group of Wratharis rebels who had been hiding in the nearby woods have infiltrated this village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Keep your calm! If they were able to hide in the woods, it must have been a small force! Restore our formation and intercept their attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh no! What is Zeke the Blood Wolf doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Surrender yourselves.<br>If you put down your weapons without a fuss, your lives will be spared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Do you really think we could believe that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I haven't forgotten how many fleeing soldiers you murdered on that battlefield!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...I will repeat myself. Give up, and surrender yourselves. The Dawn of Wrath has ended a long time ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It hasn't ended! Nothing ever did!<br>Yes, everything is still the same!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Let there be glory for the people of Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What? This light! A transmutation?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Arghh! Ughh... W-Wratharis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...He succumbed through the excessive alchemic energy in his body? But... this phantom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I remember your face.<br>How could I ever forget?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>We met at the castle of Wratharis...<br>Do you realize that they used Alchemy to summon you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...Yes, I'm aware of that. I am a dead person. In the end, no one had been able to flee that burning castle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Judging by your body, your transmutation was incomplete. Your manifestation won't last that long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It seems like the war is still continuing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>No, it did end.<br>This is nothing but a flickering ember of bloody days of the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Am I supposed to express my grudge towards you now? Or... am I supposed to thank you, hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The war did end.<br>So you were right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But it does make me wonder. If that was truly the last bloodshed, then what am I doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Tell me, Blood Wolf. When is this peace you speak of finally going to come?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>If you cannot answer that question, why don't we start over once more?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Why don't the two of us start a second Dawn of Wrath?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Tsk! You fool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Ah, I'm glad.<br>You're finally starting to show some spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I always wondered. What would have happened if I hadn't left Caesar's side that day?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Would our combined power still not have rivaled yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Come on, tell me.</td>
