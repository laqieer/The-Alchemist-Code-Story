<td>With a flick of Morrigan's wrist, an illusory Eira materializes from the surface of the shimmering pool.</td>

<td>I smelled blood on the wind as screams reverberated around me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My senses were on fire; my legs were raw from running.</td>

<td>To think a child as young as Eira had lived through such horrors.</td>

<td>The fear of her flight faded with time, until her nightmare tailed her once more in that dark Goetia basement.</td>

<td>There you are.</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I've been looking for you.</td>

<td>(The question is, what will become of it?)</td>

<td>There's nowhere left to run, little fox.</td>

<td>I'll tear you from limb to limb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ugh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No! Enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Eira...fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So you wish to fight against your fears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Very well, child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I shall bear witness to your resolve.</td>
