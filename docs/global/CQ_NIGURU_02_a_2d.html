<td>Hm, just as I thought. The Wratharis Research Laboratory is under the Holy Guard's control. I doubt they would let us simply walk in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(Soon after the laboratory was assaulted, we searched through the secret room, but the tome was already missing.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(There is only one who could have taken it. But was there really a chance to do so in the chaos of the fire and director's death?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(Perhaps there was some assistance, or even prior knowledge of the attack.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(Good grief.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(Still, telling Ila now to not follow me would fall on deaf ears.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(I'd much rather avoid getting her riled up and drawing attention. I suppose it is best to let her do as she wills for now.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(That being said...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(Hold your breath and wait for the right moment. Watch your target's habits and anticipate their next move.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(Though I know she has a distaste for sneaking around, she's putting what I taught her to good use.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Now then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>According to what I heard, those who worked at that laboratory were all persecuted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Was there anyone who evaded the persecution?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well... I haven't heard anything about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hm... Not a single lead. This is turning out to be more difficult than expected. So whispers the darkness within me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(With so little information, there's really nothing to support the possibility that anyone managed to get away.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(Still...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(It looked to me like that informant was hiding something.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Then wait for the cover of darkness I shall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You seem to be having fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hmph... What do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>There was something I forgot to tell you earlier. It's about the researcher you're looking for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Since you've been a loyal patron of mine for quite some time, I figured I could tell you. For a price, that is. Just a simple favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>A favor? I'm almost afraid to ask.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Nothing too difficult for someone like you. I just need someone dead. You can make that happen, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but I've retired from assassination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh, come on now. All I have to do is yell and this place will be swarming with Paladins. We wouldn't want that, now do we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(Hm... If I were alone, I could easily avoid a battle, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(With Ila here, escape may prove to be a bit difficult. I should try to avoid trouble.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(So I still cannot cut my ties with that family. This filthy, cursed blood of assassins...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(Though that is all that we share, this blood is the curse that binds me to that family.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(It appears that those born in the darkness cannot escape this curse and are fated to become shadows.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>â€”n't stand this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ila?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I just can't stand this! I can't even stand listening to this for another second!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I can't stand how you'd try to force someone else's hand to get what you want! If you want somebody dead, kill them yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hey! What's going on here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Oh snap!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hey! Wait! Get back here, coward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So you're the cause of all this ruckus! Come. We've got some questions for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Aah! Move! Out of my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Dammit! He got away! I can't stand you Paladins! I just can't stand you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>S-stop! Calm down! Hold it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>As if I'm going to listen to you Paladins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You little brat! Settle down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'm not a little brat! I'm a Shadow Messiah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What?! The Shadow Messiah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ila... Honestly.</td>
</tr>
