<td>Now we just have to deal with you. Tell me, stranger... What is your purpose here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>My will...is the protection of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Protection...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You mean to say that you desire to preserve the state of this mad and twisted world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Sin is the foundation of this world; and it is sin, and only sin, that can truly purify it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Purifying the world...with sin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're wrong! Sin must be eradicated, so that the world can be made anew!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>True purification of this world can only be achieved by creating a new world order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What you seek is a new world, but running contrary to the way of this world will lead only to its mutation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You must open your minds, Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Open our minds?! That's rich!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You have the gall to stand there and lecture us about the protection of this world when you would revive the Cursed Beast?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You're a hypocrite!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So long as there is a sky overhead and earth stretches below it, this world will continue to exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Even if the world of man should fall...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wh-what are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The world of man...will fall?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Humankind are nothing but irregularities that sprung up from the earth like worms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Y-you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Humankind does not deserve our protection. This world does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What is a world without people?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I am here to change this world for the better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Even now, you fail to realize that you are committing sin! Your arrogance is just that—pride!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Theory unfolding! Reconfigure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Still you resist the truth... "Fall upon us, oh shapeless one!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Nnrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Argh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Huzzaaahhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Haa...haa...haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So...this is...it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Wh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I have done what I was bound to do. I might as well retreat. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It would be most regrettable if this new technique of yours were to disappear now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So...I will claim it for myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Power...stolen from God.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'll just use my technique again, to...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Too slow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Infinite light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The Vessel of Purification... Hmm... That would make this the light of Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Haa...haa...haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Thanks, Emmel... Ngh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>E-Emmel...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It cannot be helped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Still, with this, I can protect the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What's he talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Farewell...Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You're not going anywhere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Futile...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>May my sword break on your...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Waginau! Get back! The corruption—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hold on...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>He's...gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hey... What the hell was he talking about? What was all that stuff he said about protecting the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Tch... This world doesn't need protection! It deserves nothing less than to be destroyed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>And I... I will do it. I'm going to tear this world apart, and remake it myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>L-Lord...Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What is it, Julia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I-I... I humbly beg for your forgiveness. All of this happened because I wasn't—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Julia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What are you talking about, Julia? You risked your life so that my sister might escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>It's thanks to you that we made it here as soon as we did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>If anything... I owe you thanks, Julia, for saving my sister's life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>So, thank you, Julia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Lord Nimul, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Guys! The ground's shaking like crazy! If we don't do something soon, the Cursed Beast is gonna get free!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>If that happens...this entire region... Maybe even the entire world, not to mention everyone in it...will be—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Utterly destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Ngh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Nimul...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I-I... I'm going to do what I can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>No, Emmel! Just leave it to me. I'll—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Nimul. This is my duty as the Vessel of Purification. If things end here, everything you have dreamed of will come to naught.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I... But I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Wh-what does she want to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Emmel is the Vessel of Purification...as you should know well by now. As such, she is the only person who possesses the power to cleanse the earth of corruption, and suppress the powers of the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>But that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>O Sephiron, our great Mother, Tree of Life... Pray, heed my call...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Descend from your supreme heights, oh King. From nothing to infinity, from infinity arises the light. Oh, sacred, sacred, sacred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Transform your candor. I seek repose for his soul, 22nd in form... Come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Wh-what's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Emmel...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Why?! Why is nothing happening?! N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>O-once more... I'm going to try again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Transform your candor. I seek repose for his soul, 22nd in form... Come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Nngh... Why?! Am I...? Am I not—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Vessel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Th-that's...Asena! Y-yes, Your Divinity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Take this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>It is Matter. Contained within are the powers of the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg: earth, water, wind, and fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Matter...? What is...? I mean, what do I do with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>With this...thou must kill Us. Slay the Guardian Dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>What are you saying, Godwolf?! You would have us kill our Guardian Dragon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>The Guardian Dragon works to suppress the powers of the nascent Cursed Beast, and is assailed by corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>N-no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>But that means that the Great Nidhogg...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Before long, the Guardian Dragon will fall to sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>No...! What will become of the village—of the Sephira?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Devoured by the corruption, all life will die out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>No! This can't be happening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Vessel. Chief of the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Slay the Guardian Dragon. Protect the Sephira from doom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>B-but, Your Divinity—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>This is all that can be done...to save...the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Your Divinity...? Your Divinity, can you hear me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Little girl... Is this the way of the world that you desired?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Your Divinity! P-please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>H-hey! Guys?! This is really, really bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>But, I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Let's go, Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>N-Nimul?! You're not... You're not just going to abandon Sephiron, are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>You heard the Godwolf. We must slay the Guardian Dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>B-but... We can't just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>So long as you and I work together, I know we can do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Then I am going to remake the world! Create a new world order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>N-Nimul...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Uh... I don't think Julia can walk, so I'm gonna have my Engineer Soldier carry her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Thanks, Adaleigh. Let's get going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Corrupted beasts...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Trying to stall us, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Wh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Such speed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>The wind will blow where it will. It cannot be stopped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I will not stand by and let anyone destroy this world I call home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>If such destruction is necessary under the way of this world, then I will take up my sword and fight to subvert this so-called order alongside he who I would call my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>For that is my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Yna...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Amazing! He took out all those beasts in a single instant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>I am Yna Ku. On my honor, I will aid you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Glad to have you on board!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>The deed is far from done. Before we go... Here. This is for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Use it well, Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Wh-what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>It is close to the best blade that I can forge at present. I think it only appropriate that it be wielded by the hands of one of the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>This blue blade... It can't be...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>A Sephirium-forged blade?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Yna Ku...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>As you endeavor now to protect the current state of your soul, I bestow upon you my present best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>May your soul and your thoughts be one and the same. With this blade, protect all that is important to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Hmph. I don't need you to tell me to do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Hey, guys? Something's coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>The Godwolf...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>N-no...! Your Divinity! Please, speak to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Has she...? Has she fallen to the corruption of sin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Damn it all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>The corruption must be progressing far faster than we realized! Does this mean that the Guardian Dragon has fallen, too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Well? What're we gonna do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>What can we do? We must take her down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Nimul! She might be corrupted, but she's still the Godwolf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Emmel. We must keep going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Was it not Asena who told us? If we want to protect this world, we must slay the Guardian Dragon...and the Godwolf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I will do it. I will take down the fallen Godwolf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>That was Asena's hope, as it is mine. Hope for the new world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>L-Lady Emmel... For the sake of us all...please, listen to your brother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>You understand, don't you, Emmel? We need to protect—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>The Sephira. Our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Alright. As you say, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>O Godwolf... May your bones form the cornerstones of my new world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Now, watch carefully...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>As I take my first step toward its formation!</td>
