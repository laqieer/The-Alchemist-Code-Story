<td>Hey, that shadow... Could it be Santa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes, I'm sure of it! We need to complete the hunt for Santa that we abandoned last year!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>H-hey, hold on, young ladies! First, let's hear what the snowmen have to say!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Exactly! Also, they're called the Maruda tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...Hurry up and talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Aaaah!</td>

<td>Huddled deep within Northern Pride...we heard a rumor that there was a fad of celebrating Winter Holiday in Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We are both the spirits of snow, as well as the spirits of Winter Holiday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Winter Holiday was a custom belonging to another world, but we-along with the elves of Northern Pride-are the ones who spread it here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>However, upon secretly observing the festivities...we realized that Winter Holiday was being celebrated somewhat differently than how we had originally presented it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>In particular, the snowmen of this country are far from adorable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Snowmen are supposed to be adorable! This is all wrong! All of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>As we continued to investigate, we even heard about rumors of a fake Santa Claus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We came all this way here in order to capture him and teach him what a true Winter Holiday is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Sigh... I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So, the reason why you decorated the snowmen and covered everything in snow was to teach everyone what a true Winter Holiday is like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Then, don't you think we really should go hunt for Santa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Come, little snowmen, let's find him together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(Hey, Michael...what are you gonna do about this?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh?! Is that him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Here he comes. Let's go, snow spirits!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Alrighty!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hmph. We're not letting you get away this year!</td>
