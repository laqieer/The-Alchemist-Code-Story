<td>In the old tongue, the words for justice and peace...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...were one and the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ooh, ooh! Does that mean that peace and justice are the same thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes, that would be correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Then why do kings love war so much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Have you been in wars too, Miss Button?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>A study trip?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You're finally getting your chance! Isn't this wonderful, Lady Button?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's thanks to your efforts that the ceaseless conflict in Wadatsumi has calmed, Button.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>As shrine maiden to the royal family of Wadatsumi, you will need to broaden your knowledge of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I traveled around the islands myself when I was your age, Button.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But Mother, Father... Are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You've been begging me to read you stories of other lands every night since you were a little girl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Granny...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We know how much you long to travel across the sea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Isn't that why the Samurai you summon takes the form of a powerful warrior from a distant land?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well... Yes, but...</td>

<td>022</td>
<td>Your only chance is a single trade vessel bound for the continent of Babel that stops at Greed Dike's port every two months.</td>

<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Blue skies followed me everywhere I went, and I was always there to watch the starry skies fade into daylight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The day when I would begin my journey chasing after those stars was close at hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oho! Look who it is. The Shrine Maiden of Justice herself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hehe. Isn't it a little early to be drinking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Thankfully, we've got nothin' better to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Thanks to her, you mean! You're our savior, Lady Button! You're the one who's given us this peace and freed us up to drink!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Lady Button, I heard you finally got permission to leave this island! Bet you're looking forward to that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That's great news! You've been talkin' about goin' abroad when we achieved peace for as long as I've known you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh, um, actually...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>When you come back, you've gotta tell us all about your adventures!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I would, but I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I refused the offer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I like it here in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Of course I understand where my parents are coming from, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You're a good kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The shrine maidens who serve the royal family must use their magic to bring peace to the people. We must save them through the teachings of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I know that studying abroad is an option that might help bring me closer to those ideals, I just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>So why not go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Well, I have my students...and I know that my mother, father, and granny would be lonely without me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Not to mention the fact that someone has to keep an eye on certain drunken soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Besides, I like being here in this old shop, surrounded by the traditional wares of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You say that, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Every single item you've picked up in here today has been a trinket from a foreign land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I... Oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>There are so many more things like this waiting for you to discover them across the sea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Remind me⁠—what's your life's dream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Why are you asking me that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You've told me countless times before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Oh, very well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...World peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(I long for world peace.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(I believe that everyone in this world hopes and prays for peace and happiness.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(Meeting those people, talking with them, connecting with them... Learning about the land, making new friends...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>(If only I could make everyone a part of my family... If only we could live out all of our lives together in harmony... That is all I wish for, and yet...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(The blurred expanse that lies beyond the infinite horizon calls to me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(Is what I believe to be just truly correct?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(I keep searching for what is right in this endless world, on and on and...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Found you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I've been looking for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>O-oh! It's you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hello, Shrine Maiden of Justice. I'm here to escort you on your scholarly travels!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Ikasa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Are you all ready to go, Button?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Go? Go where?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>First, to the horizon that stretches out as far as the eye can see. Second, to the lands you've been dreaming of all your life. Third, back to your peaceful homeland fading into the distance behind you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Wait a minute, I⁠—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Good luck, Miss Button! Study hard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Don't worry about Wadatsumi. We'll take care of her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Get a move on! The world isn't going to bring peace to itself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You're all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Take care, Button.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Oh, Mother, please don't cry! This isn't goodbye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You're right. I know. We'll see each other again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Oh, Lady Button! I'm as happy for you as if it were my own dream that's come true. Brings tears to my eyes, it does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Granny! Don't you start crying too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Go on, Button.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Father...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Fourth, to the side of your faithful friend and fellow dreamer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Fifth, to the sky above you. What do you see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It's...beautiful! Blue skies, as far as the eye can see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>All is well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>So I ask you again, Button. Are you all ready to go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>And the correct answer is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I never could have imagined that inky sky full of stars coming down to crush me.</td>
</tr>
