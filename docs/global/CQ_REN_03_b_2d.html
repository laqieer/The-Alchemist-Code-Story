<td>Piece of cake.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>*Giggle* You didn't even break a sweat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That was nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oof…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I could've handled him by myself. You worry too much, Chloe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is how the Scarlet Flame Guard operates. We fight together… Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What? Don't tell me he got you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's just a scratch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That blade was poisoned! Dammit. Hurry to Natalie's!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But what about you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I can handle it from here. Go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A-Alright. I'm counting on you…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Unbelievable… That was such a cheap trick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh? Did I just say that? I must've eaten something weird.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Vettel and Gerald and Chloe, they're all such good people. Maybe they've rubbed off on me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Whatever. Who wants to die first?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm not in the mood to mess around, so if you're the last one standing consider yourself lucky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Bubbles, carried on the wind, danced in rays of sunlight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's what they get for playing dirty--Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You defeated them all by yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Chloe, you're back! Did you get the poison antidote from Natalie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yep--made it just in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Once it was over, she gave a weird smile and tried to shoot me up with more meds. I barely made it out of there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Sounds like Natalie, alright. I'll have to report to her later and thank her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Thank you for taking care of everything. I'm grateful you used your sword to protect us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I used my sword to kill. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Come on. I can tell you were protecting us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Give me a break…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You dispatched the assassins despite them not meeting your standards and you got angry when they used poison, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm just looking forward to the day I kill Captain Vettel and Gerald. I don't operate under any moral code like they do, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Besides, I'm curious to see how Captain Vettel leads the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>My moral code is all thanks to Captain Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I know there are always people I can rely on. My faith in that will never die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I dunno. I guess sometimes it's good to make sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Make sure of what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Of where we belong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(I wonder if my sis thought so too.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>People die pretty easily, actually--Even if it doesn't always look that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Are you afraid of dying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Not really. I'm looking forward to when that day comes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You don't want to get kicked out, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>If I get kicked out, I won't be able to kill the people I want to kill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You're a terrible liar, Renny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I want to protect the Scarlet Flame--its shining light--together with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Would you believe me if I said, "Me too?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But you know I'm a liar, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hey, those bubbles look fun. Can I join in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You want to join?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Maybe there was more to it, after all…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>More to what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Can you teach me the knight's code, sometime?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Bubbles, dancing in the wind, sparkled in rays of sunlight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Don't believe me when I say I don't belong in the Scarlet Flame Guard. That'll be the last lie I ever tell.</td>
</tr>
