<td>That's enough, Adelbert. I will no longer stand for your coddling. I may be little more than a figurehead here, but even I can understand the situation we are in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>The Liberation Army is at the end of its rope. The line is being held by little more than the fervor of our soldiers.</td>

<td>If I retreat, what will become of them? I must stay, as a boon to their morale!</td>

<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>Adelbert, you are wasting your breath. I shall not leave. The minute we began our advance, I made my decision to return victorious or not at all.</td>

<td>Hmmm. Captain, I believe that we will be able to handle this. What are your orders?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dios.png" alt="Dias" height="128"><br>Dias</td>
<td>Interesting. I didn't expect that you would be so eager to jump into the fray.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Guard Knight</td>
<td>The Jam are the manifestations of the curse that threatens to consume this country. With this many of them present, it will not be long before it becomes a problem for the whole continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Guard Knight</td>
<td>It's times like these that something as petty as borders and disputes between countries lose all importance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Guard Knight</td>
<td>As knights of the Holy Guard who are charged with maintaining the order of Babel, our duty is to fight here against the enemy that endangers this entire continent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dios.png" alt="Dias" height="128"><br>Dias</td>
<td>I see. Then I release you to such a noble duty. My only command is that you make sure to stay out of my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Guard Knight</td>
<td>Understood. Knights of the Holy Guard, follow me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Agatha</td>
<td>I don't see Logi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dios.png" alt="Dias" height="128"><br>Dias</td>
<td>None of the Blue Tongues are here either. I suppose they have broken through the vanguard and are in the midst of the enemy.</td>

<td>Oh no!</td>

<td>Don't forget, he carries a Sacred Stone. Even a horde like this is unlikely to bring him to his knees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dios.png" alt="Dias" height="128"><br>Dias</td>
<td>Agatha, hide here and wait for me to return. Promise me you won't follow. If anything ever happened to you, Logi would never be the same.</td>

<td>O-okay.</td>

<td>Then, perhaps...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Beast of Wisdom</td>
<td>Blithering fools! With Cryphone awakened, no matter how many pests arrive to give you aid, this will be your end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holy Guard Knight</td>
<td>Wh-what?! The Jam can talk?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dios.png" alt="Dias" height="128"><br>Dias</td>
<td>Do not falter! Whatever differences these might exhibit from the Jam that we have fought before hardly matter in the face of our Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Beast of Wisdom</td>
<td>Hahaha... You are right in that Alchemy is a powerful weapon to use against us, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dios.png" alt="Dias" height="128"><br>Dias</td>
<td>What...is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Beast of Wisdom</td>
<td>Hahaha! You are far too outnumbered! We are limitless, we are multitude! Take one of us down, two, three, it doesn't matter! We feel no pain, and our loss is but temporary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Beast of Wisdom</td>
<td>Flail at us as much as you want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Marie... So she really...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>We can save this conversation for later. First, let's get the Liberation Army out of here. Adelbert, are you ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>You have my gratitude, Kamui! With you and the Holy Guard here to cover us, we should be able to withdraw without too many casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>All soldiers, prepare to move out! Do not break formation! Advance more slowly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/adelbelt.png" alt="Adelbert" height="128"><br>Adelbert</td>
<td>Leave behind anything you can! Our lances and swords are useless against them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Your Highness, hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceclidis IV</td>
<td>Understood.</td>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dios.png" alt="Dias" height="128"><br>Dias</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>The Holy Guard has come to relieve the rear guard on both flanks. I hope that will not be an issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/logi.png" alt="Logi" height="128"><br>Logi</td>
<td>It isn't. We and the Blue Tongues will handle the headquarters, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You are my opponents today? Show me what you can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Don't let yourself get too distracted here, Georgios. All we need to do is hold the line until the Liberation Army has successfully retreated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/past_kamu.png" alt="Kamui" height="128"><br>Kamui</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>The time has come for you to die before you ever understand what I have said to you... This is your end, Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>What?! What was...? Was that...? No... Seida?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Oh well. I suppose justice is not so easily achieved, after all. I must see this through to its end.</td>
