<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Urk... Lady Tina! Fall back with His Highness and leave this to us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I am not such a coward as to turn my back on this battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Your Highness, I commend your loyalty, but there is no other option!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Our country cannot afford to lose our king! Please, fall back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's enough, Adelbert. I will no longer stand for your coddling. I may be little more than a figurehead here, but even I can understand the situation we are in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The Liberation Army is at the end of its rope. The line is being held by little more than the fervor of our soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If I retreat, what will become of them? I must stay, as a boon to their morale!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It is only a matter of time before our ranks crumble, whether you stay or retreat! At least if you surviveâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Adelbert, you are wasting your breath. I shall not leave. The minute we began our advance, I made my decision to return victorious or not at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Your Highness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There must be some way we can still win!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Grrraaarrr?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wind Ouija!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Is everyone all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Mocca! How?! Wait... If you're here, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm sorry to have kept you all waiting. I've brought reinforcements!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It looks like this is the source of the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hmmm. Captain, I believe that we will be able to handle this. What are your orders?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Interesting. I didn't expect that you would be so eager to jump into the fray.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The Jam are the manifestations of the curse that threatens to consume this country. With this many of them present, it will not be long before it becomes a problem for the whole continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's times like these that something as petty as borders and disputes between countries lose all importance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>As knights of the Holy Guard who are charged with maintaining the order of Babel, our duty is to fight here against the enemy that endangers this entire continent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I see. Then I release you to such a noble duty. My only command is that you make sure to stay out of my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Understood. Knights of the Holy Guard, follow me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I don't see Logi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>None of the Blue Tongues are here either. I suppose they have broken through the vanguard and are in the midst of the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Don't forget, he carries a Sacred Stone. Even a horde like this is unlikely to bring him to his knees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Agatha, hide here and wait for me to return. Promise me you won't follow. If anything ever happened to you, Logi would never be the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>O-okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The Holy Guard has come to our aid?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Then, perhaps...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Blithering fools! With Cryphone awakened, no matter how many pests arrive to give you aid, this will be your end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wh-what?! The Jam can talk?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Do not falter! Whatever differences these might exhibit from the Jam that we have fought before hardly matter in the face of our Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hahaha... You are right in that Alchemy is a powerful weapon to use against us, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What...is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hahaha! You are far too outnumbered! We are limitless, we are multitude! Take one of us down, two, three, it doesn't matter! We feel no pain, and our loss is but temporary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Flail at us as much as you want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Don't underestimate us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hahahaha! Hahahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huzzaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Is everyone all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Kamui! I would ask you the same, but your presence here is answer enough. Only...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Marie... So she really...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>We can save this conversation for later. First, let's get the Liberation Army out of here. Adelbert, are you ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You have my gratitude, Kamui! With you and the Holy Guard here to cover us, we should be able to withdraw without too many casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>All soldiers, prepare to move out! Do not break formation! Advance more slowly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Leave behind anything you can! Our lances and swords are useless against them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Your Highness, hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Now then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I've always thought that I wouldn't see you again until it came time to fight you, but it doesn't seem like fate had the same plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The Holy Guard has come to relieve the rear guard on both flanks. I hope that will not be an issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It isn't. We and the Blue Tongues will handle the headquarters, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You are my opponents today? Show me what you can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Don't let yourself get too distracted here, Georgios. All we need to do is hold the line until the Liberation Army has successfully retreated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The time has come for you to die before you ever understand what I have said to you... This is your end, Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What?! What was...? Was that...? No... Seida?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Oh well. I suppose justice is not so easily achieved, after all. I must see this through to its end.</td>
