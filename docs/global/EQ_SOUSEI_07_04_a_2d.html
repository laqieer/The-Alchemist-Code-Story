<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>So, this is the current condition of the Ire Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. Even though Satna has been destroyed, the earth has already been consumed by the rain of fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Reconstruction will take...a very long time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm certain that many villagers lost their lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Do you grieve for the people of this Belt who have died?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm glad that you are the Invidia Belt's king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Let us live on together, people of Ire. To live on as survivors is the sole way to indemnify the dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Where are Lord Nimul and the others? I have been told that this airship is needed to move between the regions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I myself do not know what happened after they were caught in Quence's magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Only I was left, alone, by the crater.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I seriously thought I was going to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hm... I am sure they are fine. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What can we do for them as we are now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There is something that we alone can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Lend me your aid so that we may save Nimul and the others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Why was I sent to this time? How can I find the others?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I don't have enough information to figure that out. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Do I have some idea of what Belt this is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Something about it reminds me of the Ire Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The propensity to seek strength and train oneself... But there are differences, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What's the matter? Is this the extent of your strength?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>At this rate, gaining rank is a far-off dream for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Grr... I'm not done yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's the spirit. You can rest when you're dead! Fight! Train! That's what we live for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The strength to survive is all those in the Ire Belt desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>They want the strength to withstand the harsh environment and encroaching flames of corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But they appear to be different somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If they were just training, that sternness wouldn't be necessary. Wait, are they just training in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It looks to me as if they're trying to kill each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hmm... Something's happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You all seem to be working hard, my people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's Lord Kubera!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Why would he visit such a low-rank training ground?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Well, all the young people here are almost of age. It might be a good time to pair them up so they can grow as soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No, the time for us to kill each other to grow stronger has passed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The day to take on the Cursed Beast Mammon which—we all have been striving for for generations—is drawing near!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Then, that must mean...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>First, we need weapons. Stronger, tougher blades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Start gathering soldiers ready for slaying a dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You heard him, soldiers! The time of our end, our final trial, is at hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Those who feel they are ready for this moment, ready your gear and gather over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Time waits for no one! If you want glory on the battlefield, get ready quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Slay a dragon? Their final trial? What are they talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>However, with all this going on, security has been so tight that I've been unable to get close. Is it even possible to make my way inside?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hurry! Lagging behind here will result in shame you will never be able to erase as a warrior!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Phew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I am skilled in subterfuge magic. With it, I can hide myself using the surrounding magic. Perhaps that would be useful in this situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Eulalia is better at this sort of thing than I am, though... Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Just as I thought, the magil in this mansion is different from other kinds I've felt before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What is going on in this mansion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hm? This presence... Is that you, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That voice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>So this is where you've been, Bianca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hmm, I honestly thought you'd come save me sooner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It couldn't be helped. After I got tossed into this region, I had no idea where I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Save you...? Do you mean to say you are trapped here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>In a manner of speaking. Well, if I put my mind to it, I can probably get out at any time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>But I thought that if I wanted to meet back up with you, waiting here was the best way to do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Oh, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>More importantly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I have a mountain of things I would like to ask you. You seemed willing to talk about how Quence's spell failed and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>How to return to your proper time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>That is what I would like to know about the most.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You said that coming here was the quickest way to reunite with Emmel and the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Mmm, it's still a little early for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>In this point in time, moving freely through time is the domain of Space-Time Manipulation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>So long as you can't use that, trying to meet up with your friends right away will be hopeless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Don't worry. It'll only take ten years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>If that's what you really wish to do, spend ten year's time here. That's the most surefire way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>If you do that, you'll return to the time you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Is that...all right? Won't the future be affected?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I don't know about that. Space-Time Manipulation is the new possibility you all created.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I obviously can't tell you outcomes that haven't come out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>In other words, you deceived me well and good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I never lied, but wouldn't it be better to spend ten years on a sure thing rather than endlessly wandering the Cosmic Egg forever like you were?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>That may be true, but—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Keep your voice down. The guards might find you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Tsk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>There are other things I would like to ask you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>What did you mean when you said this world did not exist before the birth of the Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>You never thought about it? No, with all your traveling, you must have thought it was strange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>These lands separated by the Beasts' power were once one land of seven sins. That layout has changed far too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I guess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Those seven worlds that you would never have guessed were once the same world... They really weren't the same world at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>What did you just say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>This world—the consolidated territory of those seven sins—was originally a totally different one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>That is, until dragons, who were unwilling to accept the destruction of their world, started to fruitlessly struggle against it long, long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Dragons created the Belt regions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Cursed Beasts are just tools for that end. It was people who started calling them Beasts in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>To compensate for losing their world, they started to draw in tons of things from beyond. Earth, water, plants, animals...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>And then, you humans were dragged into this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>This conversation is too vast. Nidhogg, Zafeiris, Selsieg... I've met those who called themselves dragons many times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>But I was unaware they had power enough to reshape the world that much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>The dragons just created "Gods." Convenient gods that could save them from annihilation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Gods?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>So you have finally set foot in this domain—you, who will pierce the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Is that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>But the dragons still went extinct in the end. And the world was handed down to you humans. But it was a world for dragons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Thus, the law of dragons rules the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Which is why it's hard to live here. It must be so difficult and painful for you all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>The current world wasn't made for you, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>It's not our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>So that's why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>All the days spent living in fear of corruption... The tomorrows when we cannot avoid sacrificing someone important to someone else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>All because this world isn't designed for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Well, it's not entirely inhospitable...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>But most of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Yet, there is a way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I told you before. The Cursed Beasts are a tool for reshaping the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>The anomaly that occurred during your time... The abnormality that happened in the region was caused by that Cursed Beast losing its power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I thought so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>But if you defeat them, obtain them, and follow them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Your wish is sure to come true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>You should be able to destroy the current world and remake it for humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>So how about it, Nimul? We're ready to take you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Will you join forces with us, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Us...? Sounds like a devil's bargain... Oh, I see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>You're also an Infinite Serpent, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Hee hee, you're a perceptive one. But you're a little off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>The Infinite Serpent is me. It's my old name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I suppose I should introduce myself properly. My name is Bianca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Creator of the Infinite Serpent organization, instigator of the fall of the dragon Zafeiris, and the one who spurred your adventure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I am the mutineer of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Truly?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I come to ready the troops, only to find this. What are you doing, priestess of Ouroboros?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Thank you, Kubera. I suppose I said a bit too much—just a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>But it couldn't be helped. I've been waiting for so, so, so, sooo long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>The time  is nigh for a human like you who bears the right to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Lord Kubera! You are the leader of this region, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>This girl and the Infinite Serpent are willing to make any sacrifice to achieve their goals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>If you dance to her tune, this region will surely—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>I am aware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>To us, war is the meaning of life. It's instinct. Our pastime. The very breath in our lungs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>The meaning of life...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>We all want to become stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>From the moment we're born. Even as babies, we bleed and sharpen our fangs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Trading even the world itself for strength is not unthinkable for such creatures as we are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>How can you say that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>We seek the honor of being the strongest. There is no room for anyone to argue. None.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>That is why we live, and that will be why we die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>You've never found this way of life...empty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Never. Just considering such as thing is a waste of our time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>The citizens of Greed as I know them are very different from you and yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>One man I know wants to make gear for others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>He is the kind of person who works hard to protect and nurture something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Then he is no compatriot of ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>We wield swords before we carry hoes, and come to know violence before love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>We are a pack of bloodthirsty warriors, far from nurturing and protective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>That's... How are those the words of a leader?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>You are a guest from a distant land. We do not require your understanding. We only live to sin as we desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>You fiend...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>We have an intruder! Capture him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Tch...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>This man is an enemy who would hinder our purpose. Exterminate him according to the laws of our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>I don't know if I have what it takes on my own, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I have to try!</td>
</tr>
