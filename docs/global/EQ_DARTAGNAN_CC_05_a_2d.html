<td>Ngh... Where am I...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Awake now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You wanted to see our base, didn't you? Welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Where are the therians you've taken... What have you done to them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That band on your arm...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This? Proof of the vow I made to my fallen motherland. Seen it before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You're related to the ones who attacked the village that time... What do you want from therians?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Everything we do is for our motherland. For Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We allied ourselves with that hopeless witch in Lustburg and gathered the research left behind by the Shadow Messiah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We learned much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Like about how to create Philosopher's Stones using therian blood, the location of ruins we could use as a base, and an ancient weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>An ancient weapon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(Wh-what is that thing...? If it were to be used...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Get away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We've failed over and over... But with the blood of a powerful therian like yourself, we can finally create a perfect Philosopher's Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And with that, we can use the Demonic Soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wh-what was that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Charge!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting, Yura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Are you okay, commander?! Thank goodness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>D-D'Artagnan?! You all came for me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Tch. Why are the knights of Envylia here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The incantation gear should have hidden our location. Envylia shouldn't have the magical technology needed to get through it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>My magic may not be the best, but I'm smart enough to find someone whose magic is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'd appreciate it if you didn't underestimate the fastest and least contemplative knight in all of history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes, it seems like they're using some kind of phantom magic. But even that is some kind of composite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I knew it! What do we do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I wonder... Any bright ideas, Megistos?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hmm... My baby girls may be able to do something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Your baby girls? You mean your cannons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's right. They're made of crystals created using state of the art magic and technology. They'd have no problem going up against phantom magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I still owe you, so I'll lend them to you. Be careful, though. My babies are—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Thanks a bunch! I'll be back with them soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>H-hey! I'm not finished! If you break my babies, you'll never hear the end of it, got it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>When I heard from the captain that you were using incantation gear, I went and talked with my friend from Sloth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>And I got this thing! It really packs a punch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I-impossible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>S-Slothstein? Are you really sure this is okay? The paperwork alone is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Don't worry about it! I just borrowed it as a friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>As a friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You're friends with the people at the Slothstein workshop?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yeah, everyone's great!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>D'Artagnan... You really are amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh? You're the amazing one, Yura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You're the one who got us here in the first place! I knew your senses weren't off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It's thanks to you and Amis and everyone else that we're where we are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(Huh. She's right.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(Even if we're weak alone, we're strong together.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(Cheryl and Courage were the same.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(They'd rely on each other while bringing their own strengths to the table. D'Artagnan does the same.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(The thing that separates the two of us isn't talent, it's our relationships with the people around us.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(Thank you for teaching me this, D'Artagnan.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Now, then... It seems the tables have turned, haven't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Nnrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Give back the therian citizens of Envylia you took!</td>
