<td>008</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>

<td>012</td>
<td>Zangetsu, wasn't it? You said that I meaninglessly destroyed Wadatsumi in order to fulfill my own greed, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmph! Are you getting frightened now that you've witnessed my powers? However...none of your excuses will work on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Heheh. Excuses, huh? You really don't understand anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The destruction of Wadatsumi is what the laws of this world wished for.</td>

<td>The "laws of this world"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, I doubt it's something you'd understand.</td>

<td>The people of Wadatsumi...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I-I've decided...that'll I'll do whatever it takes to protect you</td>

<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Thank you. I will never...forget you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Y-you seem to be misunderstanding something...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I am going to reign...victorious here. Then I'll go and finish you off myself. I'm merely...letting you live a little longer for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...Let's go, Almira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>

<td>054</td>
<td>Hmph... Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But they...!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Sorry, I'm late. I made you suffer quite a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Th-that was sudden...ack...well played. Your abilities are on another level to the scum around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I never suspected that the man I crossed paths with in Wratharis was the leader of the Templars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Owww.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But...it's like a dream to be able to fight you here...the hero of Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Yeah...that's pretty important. If I am your senior then shouldn't you be a little more respectful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'm not used to respecting others, but...I can give it a try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You're the leader of the Templars, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Can I convince you to ask them to back down just so that I can save some face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Do you really think I'd agree to that? This whole respect thing isn't really working.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Right. Well, in a sense I'm relieved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Relived...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>What is this?! A magic defense...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>If you'd agreed to back down...I wouldn't have anywhere to direct my anger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Captain Othima...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>It seems like you've been going around doing whatever you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I heard...you killed Captain Yauras. Is that correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Agh...Ye-yeah...that captain with the double blades, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I was avenging Sieba's death, so I made her suffer a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Ultimately, I'm pretty sure she died meaninglessly trying to protect this redhead. Hehe. I wish I could've shown it to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ill Atmosphere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Agh! Ughhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>There's a limit to how much I can turn a blind eye to...even when it comes to the actions of myÂ naive junior.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Seriously...that's an incredible amount of power, but...aren't you overdoing it a little for our first encounter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Ack! Piercing Light!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Growing up, I was told your story over and over again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>It was the story of this amazing person from Lost Blue who climbed his way to becoming a captain of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>?! Absolute Darkness!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>The truth is, in the past, I followed in your shadow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>It could be said that I have you to thank for having mastered this technique.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>It can't be...a magic defense...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Seriously. I'm getting really worked up! I can exchange blows with someone I've admired for so long!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Is he going to use magic?! Captain Othima!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>...Ex Atmosphere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Ack! Ill Atmosphere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I-is that...my technique?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>It is the pioneers who pave the path ahead, but it is those who follow that expand the path even further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Unfortunately, you're not the one who has expanded on your own technique...we did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Agh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Captain Othima!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Ug...ghh! Th...this isn't a one-handed technique!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Impossible... Is he using a combined physical and magical attack?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>To be honest, I enjoyed this very much...my hero. I should really finish you off, but...as a way of paying my respects, I'll let you live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>?! Aghh!!! Ackk!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>If you ever feel like joining our ranks, we'll welcome you with open arms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Well then. We've got one more to go. Come on, redhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>N-no...! Captain Othima!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Ar-are you okay? Hey!</td>
