<td>I guess that's all of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>So what were you saying? You wanted to ask me something, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes. Captain, you said that what is needed on the battlefield is power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Exactly that. To win, you need power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But, Captain, you've been the strongest Paladin in the Holy Guard for a long time now, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yet, you still need more power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>As a warrior, there is nothing wrong with constantly aiming for new heights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The quest for power creates an opening for evil to exploit.'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You predecessor, Captain Cadanova, used to say that often.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm worried. Earlier, I felt a heavy darkness coming from you, Captain Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I believe we must pursue a 'heart that believes in justice.'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>When the 'quest for power' surpasses this pursuit, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...And how are we supposed to carry out justice if we're dead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We can enact justice because we are alive. If we die, we cannot do anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>With power, we can survive and justice can be served. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Without power, we cannot defeat our enemies, let alone protect ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Kudan...are you still holding onto what happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I told you to let it go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Even if you had persuaded Captain Cadanova to take you with him, it wouldn't have changed the results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wadatsumi wasn't your fault either, Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No, you don't! Stop blaming yourself. You don't deserve to suffer anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I spoke a little too much. Let's hurry on.</td>
