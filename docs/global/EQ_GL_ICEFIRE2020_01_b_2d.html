<td>Think we can call this place home for awhile? Seems like they could really use some protection around here.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sounds good to me, but to protect all of them with a party of our size? We'll need to get stronger somehow.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah boss, but even then, all I found was the myth and her name. Searching for her is going to be way tougher.</td>
