<td>Tch! Bullets don't seem very effective...!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Get back, Minario! We'll take it from here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What are you talking about? It's you all that shouldâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Are you okay, Minario?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Th-this is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Cool, right? They're Spiritbonders... People of Sephira that can defeat corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>They're not just a fairy tale, huh? They really exist...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Are you all right, Minario?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yeah, thanks to you! It's an honor to meet a living legend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...Legend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That reminds me of something Adaleigh said when he first arrived in the Gula Belt Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Finally... Finally! I'm finally here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Remember when I told you what can be mined from the land here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There are always some ruins close to a deposit of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>They have existed since before anything in our history books, maybe by eons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Within them, there are some written accounts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Somewhere in this world is a promised land without sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Those who reside there possess the power of purification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So you crossed the barrier on the hope of something so uncertain...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I won't apologize for doing what I had to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No, I'm actually quite impressed. There aren't many people who would put their own safety on the line with only that information available to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It was reckless, without a doubt. But it was also quite brave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh, uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What an unexpected kindred spirit for Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>They get on surprisingly well, those two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(Legends of the Sephira were told here...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(Did it really speak of us? Or some other people, with passing similarities?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ascend from the depths of the sea, oh shapeless one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What's wrong, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We must focus on the task at hand. Do Fallen often come out of the mines like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Now that I think of it, there has been a significant jump in the number of people falling victim to the Fallen recently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Do you think this might be some kind of omen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I don't know, but it would be best to be cautious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(Adaleigh's senior Icona is nowhere to be found, just as the number of Fallen suddenly increases...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Worst-case scenario, she may already be...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I have a bad feeling about all this... I hope I'm not right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hellooooo?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hello? Anybody home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Are you listening? Just how long are you going to have me locked up here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Pursuer of Sloth! Your choice cannot be permitted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Humans must accept sin. That is why the Cursed Beasts were born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You're wrong. I don't believe that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Sin is just one part of the human condition. It is each individual's choice to accept, or reject, that fact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And if that means the destruction of the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I won't let it come to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>This conversation is going nowhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The time between each earthquake keeps shrinking... It's waking...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oh no, no, no, this is not good... Our preparations aren't finished yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>This is so not looking good.</td>
</tr>
