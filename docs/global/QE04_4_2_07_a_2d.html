<td>Voda, what was that power just now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That was my Ouija. We poured all the power remaining in our Matter into Tamis and left the physical manifestations in our temples.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We are no longer bound to our Matter, which leaves us free to use every ounce of our true power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Where's Tamis?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Worry not. She is safe, even after receiving the full brunt of the power from each of our Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Tamis is at the Wind Temple, offering prayer. She is in the midst of the Ritual of Perpetual Time. Soon, the Wind Matter will be restored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's all flowing into me—such power and knowledge! I can see it—the entire history of Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I must protect Saga at all costs. We cannot be the ones to let this age-old tradition of passing down the history of Saga end. Isn't that right, Mocca?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Water nourishes...fire heats...earth creates...and wind carries all that is created from the other elements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I finally understand! You're telling me this is the hidden meaning behind the history of Saga, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Wind Matter, now is the time of your revival. Alia, please grant me strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I see. That's a relief!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yet, why would a dragon breathe water?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wait, maybe that's it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Not only did we fail to destroy its core, but now it has changed elements... What's going on? Tehre, have you any idea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No. This is beyond my reasoning. However, I may have figured out a way to destroy it...but we will need to do it ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It is the same as when I had to face my own shadow in the Trial to acquire one of Asena's Tears. The dragon exhibits qualities of fire, water, earth, and wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We need to wield the same element it is attuned with to destroy its core, as is often the case during the Trials.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Could it be that Asena foresaw this, and thus included such requirements in granting her tears to those of us capable of ascending to the rank of Sprite?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Where is Georgios?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I see. Is he no longer of this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>He died shielding me from the dragon. We swore to him that we would retrieve Beelzebub!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Glurrrppp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Now its chest is glowing? What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>They...look like humans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>How irritating! Things continue to spiral outside of my calculations!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Georgios... I will accomplish your life's mission for you, just as I promised you I would!</td>
</tr>
