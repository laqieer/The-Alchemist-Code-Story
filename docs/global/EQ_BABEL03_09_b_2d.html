</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yeah... Thanks, Balt.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Don't move. We've finally got you, Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hey, Sieba, let's hurry up and take her. I'd hate to have to deal with her making a fuss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That's true. Come on now, little girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If I were to just go with you now, I'd be wasting everything Balt and Hawk have worked for so far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'd rather die than quietly submit to you and your cause!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Carla! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I won't be killed so easily though! I'll fight you to the end!</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Nng!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Carla!</td>

<td>The tea I just brewed to perfection is going cold as we speak, but at least we seem to have made it in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Ankh, please... I'm never late when I choose to be somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ryle?!</td>

<td>I don't know who you people are, but it looks like you've been doing as you please around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It's time you paid...with interest!</td>
