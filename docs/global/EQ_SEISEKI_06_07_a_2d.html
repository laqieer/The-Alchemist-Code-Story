<td>If you can promise me that you'll kill this Kudanstein, then I'll try restoring Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Kill Captain Kudanstein?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I cannot make that promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And why is that? Isn't he the criminal who caused the rebellion, in your eyes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But... Captain Kudanstein is also an important comrade to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I think he just went a little bit astray.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Astray? Do you really think that could ever conclude the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No, I don't. But still, I can't possibly believe that killing Captain Kudanstein could be the right answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I believe I can get my feelings across to him as well. As long as he doesn't realize and face his errors, I don't think it would be a true atonement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Is that your judgment as the Lord Commander?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's not just me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I think Lord Zain would have agreed with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Zain... really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This is what he told me just before he died...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>“I am sure that the Light in you has the power to return Kudanstein back from the darkness.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Until his final moments, Lord Zain wanted to straighten Captain Kudan's errors, to bring him back on the right path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm sure he wouldn't have wanted revenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Geez, how naive can you be. Reality doesn't really work with that kind of idealism.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Miuna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But... I probably would have continued adoring him for sticking to his ideals like that. Alright then. Follow me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The sacred tools required for restoring Excalibur are slumbering in the sanctuary close to the crater ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I mean to say...<br>Because those two put their trust in you, I might as well do the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>T-thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Shadow Messiah, the elite corps formed by Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Tsk... you're probably also one of those assassins, targeting key figures for the sake of reviving Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's true that I was part of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But I didn't necessarily agree with the organization's ideals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Then... why were you part of the organization?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I just wanted to be close to Lord Zahar, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You wanted to be close to Zahar?<br>But why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Why, you ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I suppose you're asking me for the reason why I wanted to be close to Lord Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's something which is very difficult for me to explain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Phuh! We're asking you what you hoped to attain from being close to Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Apart from being close to Zahar, there was nothing else I wanted to obtain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Merely serving Lord Zahar gave me happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Happiness?<br>Being together with that malicious murderer made you happy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's true that he had a chaotic temperament, and that often got him misunderstood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But Lord Zahar was not just a cruel knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>He only seemed that way to others due to his unique sense of justice. So please stop calling him that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Are you serious?! What are you even talking about?! Zahar was just greedy for power, filled with egocentric ambition, trying to rule the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I saw him with my own eyes, and felt his malicious presence with my own skin. He's not the kind of guy you say!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>No, Lord Zahar was not what you think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's a fact after all that Lord Zahar saved my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Zahar saved your life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I was originally born and raised as a daughter of a wealthy noble house of Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But by the time I was old enough to understand, something happened that changed everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>A certain organization that was after the Sacred Stone of Wratharis assassinated countless key figures of the state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>My family too... everyone was murdered by their assassins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>A certain organization, you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'm talking about you guys; the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>In order to avoid future revenge, these members of the Holy Guard were apparently ordered to kill my whole family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>When their assassins approached me, I was prepared to die as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>One of their knights however, came to stand in in front of me to protect me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>And that was Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Yes.<br>At that time, Lord Zahar was still part of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Lord Zahar, who was the leader of this squad, ordered the others to search the mansion, thus saving my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Was that mission really an order from the Holy Guard's central command?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Zahar must have been acting by himself, faking the Holy Guard's command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>He's the type of guy who'd use any method to reach his goals. It's not unthinkable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>So what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Even if that were true, it's still a fact that Lord Zahar saved my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Whatever you may say about him, my adoration for him will never change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Do you even know what you're saying? Zahar may be the one who took your family from you, you know?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It's useless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Whatever we may say, she probably won't take it into consideration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Exactly.<br>So, would you move away now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Wait, we're not done talking.<br>So, your objective must be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>not Excalibur, but the ones who killed Zahar; Kanon and Chloe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Lord Zahar also paid a lot of attention to Excalibur, so I'm quite fascinated by the Holy Sword as well, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>my primary interest is the existence of those two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>In that case, I cannot let you go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Even though Kanon told me not to hurt you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>But having heard your intentions, I won't be able to abide by that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but I'll have to stop you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You're going to... attack me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I don't think you're a bad person...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>but even if you weren't... as long as you're after our Lord Commander's life, I cannot let you do as you please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Wait, Seida!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>She told you not to hurt me?<br>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>?!<br>The Philosopher's Stone is acting as a defense barrier?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but I cannot be wasting my time here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Ugh! We won't let you!<br>Whoaaaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Z-Zahar?!<br>Ugh! D-darn it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>M-my body won't move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Why don't you stay like that for the time being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>?!<br>You're not going to strike at us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>That's not the issue here!<br>Darn it, Kanon is in danger!</td>
</tr>
