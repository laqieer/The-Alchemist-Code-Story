<td>I guess you and Dias are fighting separately now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It was decided that we'd split up and search for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I went with the Blue Flame Guard to the ruins of Fort Mugarde...and Dias went with the Holy Guard to Fort Asard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My actions seem to have caused trouble for all of you. I'm sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You were too reckless... We were really worried, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's why I'm apologizing! I said I'm sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Y-you seem more mad than sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But, trying to broker peace between Envylia and Wratharis...that was "your own way of fighting," wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes. I really believe it's possible. Let's do what we can to make it a reality!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Heheh. I want to hurry up and show Dias how well you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Dias... Do you think he's okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Dias has a tendency to be impatient when it comes to becoming stronger. I'm worried he might go too far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's true he has that tendency, but he's always doing his best and looking to the future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm sure he's okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I hope things can quickly go back to the way they used to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Where father would scold Dias for not eating his breakfast...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>And you would oversleep and make things even worse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Then, I would ultimately have to appease father; I want to go back to those days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Come on... Save the nagging for later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's not what I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm just thinking how priceless those normal days were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Especially now that things have become the way they are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's gonna be okay! If we can build peace between our countries, then things will go back to the way they used to be; I'm sure of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
