<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Lust, Sloth, Gluttony. You sacrificed your human form to seal those three great sins inside of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I thought we got you back after we removed the Cursed Beast's cores but...I have to wonder how much is really left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...I no longer dream. I don't taste the food I eat. I don't even feel pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Which means I'm all right. I can still fulfill my duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...There's still time, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There's still time to change things. What is lost might never come back, but even soâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm afraid that isn't possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This is my duty. I took it from you to continue standing by my brother's side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It doesn't matter how heavy this burden becomes, I will not run away from my responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You two siblings really are a pair of knuckleheads...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If it isn't the traitor. Not satisfied with turning your blade on your countrymen, Andechs? What? You think you can come asking things from us now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Whew! Well. I can't really defend myself there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're pretty much right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I did betray the Ira Belt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And instead I decided to protect the citizens and people living in the Invidia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Did you come here to talk nonsense? Get to the point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ah yes, I came with good reason. We need your power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You understand what's actually happening here, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The real reason you were ordered to invade the Invidia Belt is so that the Ira Belt may steal its territory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You should know that it's already far too late for such a strategy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The king of these lands intends to kill the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That option was never even available to us. I don't think we even considered it a possibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'd...like to see this happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...There's no point in fighting the Cursed Beasts. They're a part of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Kill one, and another will simply be born in its place... That's what that serpent told us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That may or may not be true, but I'd still like to take this bet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That guy who owns the airship, Nimul? He keeps bragging that he's going to save the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...Then you're the same as him. Believing in the future of us humans... Just like the late king Arius.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Actually, about that... I want you to tell me what happened while I was gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What happened to King Arius?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hah, that's very simple. We... Well, we gave up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Completely just gave up on the future of the Ira Belt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Let's begin. I'd like to hear from you, as the people who shall lead the charge against Leviathan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>For starters, as of right now, not a single one of our attacks will hit it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What about that light from your airship? I thought that was Anti-Curse magic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Anti-Curse magic is fundamentally a method that makes contact with a target to strip away sinful magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Basically, if we can't actually make contact with it, it's not going to have any effect. So there's our problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's able to manipulate the ocean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yeah, Leviathan can envelop itself in these corrupted waters to protect itself. It has already repelled our attacks twice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Nimul figured it out pretty early on, but...that power is going to a real pain to deal with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Especially since all that corrupted ocean water attracts our Anti-Curse magic to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>So all we're doing is extracting sin from the ocean, and that's not going to get us anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It's basically like it has another layer of armor over its outer shell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yup, that's it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>So if we want to take down that Leviathan, we gotta find a way to pierce through that wall of ocean water first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Leviathan's territory is the ocean, and this kingdom is surrounded by the ocean nearly all sides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Our odds of facing it anywhere other than the ocean are pretty slim, unfortunately. That is the reality of the situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>In other words...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>We have no methods to defeat Leviathan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>But we've decided to oppose it nevertheless. For now, we must think of the things we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Of course. We're not about to give up now. We'll continue to gather information about Leviathan and devise a way to counter it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Thank you. There's just one more thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Could I ask you to look into a way to repair the Silver Shield?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That big shield? We don't mind doing that, but why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The Legend of the Shield Maiden says that this shield was once part of the ark that protected our people from being swallowed by the sea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>If you look into this matter, I feel like you might just discover a way to handle the Leviathan's "ocean" problem too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Understood. Yna and I will look into that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>A weapon spoken of in legends... It may be imprudent of me to say, but it's got me curious. I'll look into it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>As for studying the Leviathan's behavior and patterns of movement...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Leave that to me and the airship! I'll be able to observe it from relative safety as long as I stay high enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I'll come along in case things get hairy. It'll be better to have someone around who can operate Libra.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Ah yeah, you're right. I'd have to deal with a lag in the initiation if I went about it alone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Sounds good! Where should I go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I'd like you to protect Emmel and Eulalia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>The serpents are likely to target Emmel for being the Vessel of Purification. There's a chance they will try something again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Leave it to me! I'll get ready to ride that big ship...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You sure? Not worried that the ship will be too dirty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You little brat! Don't be so rude to your big sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Imnus, what will you do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I will regroup with the rest of the knights. If we're confronting the Cursed Beast, then half-hearted preparations won't be enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Sounds like everybody's made up their minds then. What do you want me to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>If you're asking, then I have a request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Oh my, a request straight from the king himself? I humbly doth accept.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I want you to cheer up the somber knight who is missing from our meeting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Hey, little lady. It's going to get dark soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Andechs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Your king asked me to check on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>His Highness did? But... There's no good reason for him to worry about me anymore...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Because you broke that big shield of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Exactly. That shield was the pride of the Invidia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>And I've gone and tainted that pride. If I was actually worthy of bearing that shield, it would've never shattered like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>...All right, get into position. We'll spar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>E-excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I thought I'd come here and fix things up with some smooth talk, but frankly, I have no clue what to tell you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Getting some training in is the best thing you can do in that kind of situation! You can clear your head by moving your body! And before you know it, you'll figure out a way to deal with your problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Ehm, well, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I don't have my shield...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>It's not like you can't fight without that shield, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Just go grab whatever weapon is easy to use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Y-yes... Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Um, I'll go with this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Oh, look at that. That looks battle-worn, yet well-maintained. What a nice shield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>This is the shield I used to train with before I was selected as the Shield Maiden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I see, like an old friend then, hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You ready to start then? Put your back into it and don't give up, 'kay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Ah, no, wait a moment! I got a little caught up in the moment, but when I think about it's there's really no way that I should be traiâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Gh... Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Nice move! You're doing better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Perhaps, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Look, I understand what you're feeling. Really, I do... Not living up to someone's expectations is rough for both parties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>But you survived, and that means you can continue to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>This isn't the end yet. There's still chances to make up for your defeat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>But the Silver Shield is already broken...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Is the shield really that important? I'd say there's a different, far more important thing to think about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Something that's more important...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>You may have lost your shield, but you didn't lose the ability to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I mean, sure, that shield was pretty amazing. This whole thing might even be a lot easier if we still had it, but!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Shield or no shield, it doesn't change the fact that we'll keep on fighting! So I'm sure you can get back up too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>You just gotta close your eyes and listen to the voices that are begging you to save them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Let me repeat myself. Your shield isn't the important thing here. All that matters is that you remember how to wield it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>At the very least, you saved my ass out there, so I feel confident saying the following.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>You're a brave little lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>In that moment, I could tell you were prepared to lose it all if it meant protecting someone. As a knight, I admire that kind of resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>That's just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Nobody here wants to see you look so down, so have a little more confidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Lemme tell you, in that moment you were practically a goddess to me, descended from the heavens to come and save my simple soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>...Uhm, now you're just exaggerating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Haha, am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Well, regardless, this battle isn't over yet. So if you've got time to stare at the twilight, well, why not spend it struggling alongside the rest of us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I won't even laugh if you're a little awkward, promise. I've got no room to talk. I'm certainly no better than you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I'm over here talking big about saving this kingdom, as if that doesn't mean killing my fellow Ira Belt knights with these very hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>If that isn't betrayal, I don't know what is. That's just where we're at now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Do you regret it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>No, I don't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I took a vow to uphold justice, and I wield my sword accordingly. If I spend my time wallowing in regret, why, I'd be dragging the name of every life I ever took through the mud. To me, that is blasphemous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Well, at least that's the selfish excuse I tell myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>You're...a very strange guy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Oh? Hmm... I'll take that as a compliment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I will too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>(Will there ever be a day that I can look to the future without any regrets about the past?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Hm? Did you say something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Excuse me, Vice-Captain! The lookouts sent us a report!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>What did they say? More Ira Belt forces?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Ah, well, yes, there are, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>We spotted their warship, but they're being attacked by Leviathan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Leviathan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>We don't know how we're supposed to respond to this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>First, calm down. Report to the castle, and the captain will take it from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>U-understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Andechs...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>...I know, they're my enemies now. There's no way we could go help 'em out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>...Are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>You sat here and listened to all my disgraceful worries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>I'd like to return the favor, and besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>It's not like the citizens of this land particularly want to see yours wiped out or anything like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>If anything, I hope that this might be the act that could put an end to this war...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>...So, we'll help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>I will arrange for a ship. You should go ahead and make your way to the port.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>So that's the Shield Maiden...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>She doesn't hesitate to lend a hand to others, even though she's drowning in her own worries. As long as it's for someone else, she can make decisions just fine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>You're already plenty amazing, little lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Well, I better pull myself back together too!</td>
</tr>
