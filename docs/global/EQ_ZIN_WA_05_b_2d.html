<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Look...the village... There's smoke rising.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What's that? Is that a signal fire?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm not sure... Let's hurry back down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What the...are these...people?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What a horrible way to be killed...the houses have been burned... Was it bandits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sen... Where is Sen?!</td>

<td>Sen...she's bleeding...</td>

<td>What happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The villagers...they didn't want the disease...to spread anymore...so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...They didn't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>They killed each other...?</td>

<td>Like a demon blade...it is sealed with a spell...that absorbs my blood...transmuting it...into Alchemy...</td>

<td>Please, use my blood...and the blade...</td>

<tr>

<td>How dare you come into this village...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You! Are you the one who commanded the villagers?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Indeed. This was all to protect the traditions passed within this village...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It was a treatable sickness! They would've lived! The traditions you speak of killed those who could have lived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The blades of this village can only be made here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>These arcane secrets surrounding the creation of these blades...must be protected by us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And you believe that is more important than the lives of your people?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That is how we were taught to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Enough. Please, leave this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>There are no longer any sick for you to save.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hey, Jin! Are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The medicine will only work on those who are living. There's nothing more for me to do here. Let's go, Arkil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...All right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Elder...take generous care with the dead...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>This country may be sick...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Things like tradition, law, and legend sound good, but...are they really more important than life itself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I don't know. Hey...Jin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It may be strange for an outsider like me to say this, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Is this country really worth it for you to save?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>The person I really want to save...is my younger sister...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Your younger sister...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I want to save her...from the sickness called the law.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I see. Well then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Until a medicine to cure law is created, you've gotta run away as far as you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Well, I'm leaving now. I feel like I want to freely roam this country now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You're not really a traveling merchant, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I was asked by your sister to find you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>So you were watching over me from the start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Sorry I deceived you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>No... Is Yomi in good health?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I see...as long as she's healthy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>All right then, you stay healthy as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Are you sure you don't want to capture me and take me to Yomi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You wouldn't surrender yourself that easily, would you? It won't be easy to keep you restrained. Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>She didn't ask that much of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Well then, if you see Yomi again, tell her: 'We will meet again someday. I am prepared. However...'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>"I want to save you. Until I find a way to do so, I cannot meet you."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>All right, I will. See you then. Oh, before that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You said when you came back to Wadatsumi, you ate something that was so delicious it made you cry. What was that again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Are you talking about the rice ball with pickled plum?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Yeah, that's it. Pickled plum, huh? I'll remember that. See you around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Heh. What a strange man. He truly is free like the wind, appearing and disappearing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Arkil...thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>(Yomi...wait for me! One day I promise to save you! I swear I will find a way!)</td>
