<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I walked alone, with nowhere to go and no place to call my home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I swung my blade. Not to gain anything, but to avoid losing anything more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Though I didn't have anything left to lose, I could never forgive seeing someone just...take something from someone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's all there was to it. That's the only purpose I ever needed. And yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It was only when I swung my sword that I was able to forget that feeling. Only in those brief moments...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I can just leave the bucket here, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yeah! You're so strong, Setsuna. That bucket was full of water!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You'll be able to pick it up soon enough, Jayme. As long as you keep training, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'll be as strong as you one day, Setsuna! Heheheh! I can't wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Training's not all fun and games, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, yeah...but I'm just saying things have been great since you came here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I really like having you around, Setsuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Welcome home, Jayme.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hey, Sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You, too, Setsuna. Welcome home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Macherie... Uh, hi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm so sorry. I shouldn't be making our guest draw water for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This is the least I could do. I appreciate the two of you letting me stay here for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>For so long? Why, you've only just arrived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I should have been gone a long while ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What? Setsuna, you're not leaving town, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well...I should.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I promised myself not to get attached to anything or anyone. I convinced myself that I don't need them, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I don't want to hold you back from what you want to do, but I still haven't had a chance to repay you for saving my life yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Please, stay for a while longer. I'm sorry. I know we don't have much to offer, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, I haven't thanked you enough yet, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh, not at all. You've done plenty for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Still, I feel like I could do more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You two are weird. Stop thanking each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Heheh. Kid's got a point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If we continue on like this, we'll end up repaying each other for the rest of our lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Don't worry, I'll be gone before then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But...I'll stick around for a while longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>After all, I have to train you up, Jayme.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yeah! I'm gonna be so strong after I get through your training!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Heheh. Well, for starters, you have to be sure to eat well and grow bigger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Perfect! I was just thinking about how hungry I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Then let's go wash our hands and have some breakfast. I'll get the plates ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh, lemme help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Sure. If you don't mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>How long has it been?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>When was the last time I lived a life like this with others?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>And for so long?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I ask myself questions I already know the answers to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I already know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The most important things I lost...they're right here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>They're here and flowing with the passage of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'm stuffed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Thank you for the meal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hmhm. You're very welcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You're taking your time this morning, huh, Sis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The shrine maidens told me to come in a little later than usual today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I would have thought that an apprentice like you would have to be there early to make preparations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's usually how it is, but they said they needed to make preparations for some ritual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>A ritual?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Some kind of ceremony. They said there are parts that they can't allow me to take part in yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Oh! Does that mean you get to watch me train with Setsuna for a bit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'm not sure if I have that much time to spare...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Why don't you ask Macherie to look over your homework?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>That should be fine. Jayme, will you show me your notes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Really?! Yeah! I haven't had Sis help me study in forever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I'll leave you two to it. I'd like to spend some time getting to know this village better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>All right. I suppose you don't need to hear this from me, but please do be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Yes. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I mustn't forget that I won't get back what I lost just by spending time with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What am I doing? Ridiculous...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I should just go around the village once and head back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>And then, Setsuna's sword went fwoosh! I couldn't see it at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>That's amazing. I bet you'll get so strong since you have such a talented teacher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>No, no, no! That doesn't matter! Setsuna said it's daily dedication that'll make me strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Hmhm. Then I guess you'll have to work really hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Oh! Hello, Setsuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>How is the studying going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Well, I asked him how his training with you is going, and we seem to have gotten sidetracked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You're so awesome, Setsuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Hmhm. Jayme keeps saying that. He is really very fond of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I didn't think our training would make for such an interesting tale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>How couldn't it?! It's exhausting, but I'm getting super strong because of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>It's only a wooden sword, but it looks so much cooler in her hands compared to when I hold it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>There's nothing cool about it in my opinion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Is something the matter, Setsuna?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Oh, uh... It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I know! Tell me about that time Setsuna fought with a real sword again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Do you mean the time Setsuna saved me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Yeah! You took out a giant bird, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Well, I don't know if it's a story that's as interesting as how you've made our training sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Oh man, I wish I'd been there to see it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Well, I for one am glad you weren't there in harm's way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Okay...but I still wanna hear about it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I suppose it's fine. It's just a story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>If Setsuna's all right with it, then so am I. But to be clear, I don't want you ever going out too far on your own, Jayme. Do you promise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Well... I'd gone out of the village to read the wind, when I was suddenly attacked by a giant bird.</td>
</tr>
