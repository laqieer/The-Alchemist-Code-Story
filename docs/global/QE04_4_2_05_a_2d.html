<td>I've seen it before, in a book I once read! I see... That tattoo...and your purification powers... Don't tell me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Georgios, we have to treat your wounds right away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No...it's too late. Beelzebub...has been taken from me yet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Why...? Why did you shield me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I have told you before: the responsibility is mine alone. Therefore, I should be the one to fight it till the bitter end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Is this the end for me? I was to reclaim Beelzebub with these very hands... To be unable to fulfill my clan's duty will be the greatest regret I leave behind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What are you rambling about?! We're not done yet! I will not allow you to die here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I wanted...to prove...that my clan was strong. I...wanted to fulfill...my clan's mission...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I knew it. Your clan is the one Tamis mentioned before... You're a survivor of the Sephira!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The people of Sephira...had the power of purification...and thrived under the Sephiron tree...but in the end, were completely exterminated. You're saying Georgios is a survivor of that clan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The Sephira were the original guardians of Beelzebub. To that end, you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yes, we were the keepers of Beelzebub. Its fate was ours to bear. That was our duty. For that sake, I continued to pursue you time after time, and now I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Georgios...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>As the last survivor of the Sephira...I swallow my pride...and beg of you... You must re-take Beelzebub in my stead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Don't speak any more, Georgios!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Were we exterminated...because we were...weak? Are...we humans...mere insects in the sight...of nature?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Nay... I refuse...to believe it! You...must...live on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What...are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Haha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This isâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I have bestowed upon you what little remains of my strength... The power of purification now dwells within the cloth wrapped around your arm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Georgios!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You now have the power to reverse Beelzebub. I regret that I cannot be the one to reclaim it once more, but I entrust that duty to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Once you defeat it, we may have a chance to meet again... Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Enough. You've said enough, Georgios!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hahaha... So this is what...it's like to have someone you...can trust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I...leave the rest...to you...my strong comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Georgios! You can't die yet! Georgios!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Glurrrp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>They just won't give us a break!</td>
