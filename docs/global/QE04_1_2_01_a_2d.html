<tr>

<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>Paza village starts from around here. It's a neutral trade village with a vast marketplace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>What do you mean "from around here"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>This village of Paza was formed when people began to gather and form a market along the main road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>In theory, the center of the town is a little further ahead, but there are no clear territorial boundaries. There are a lot of villages like that in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>That's why even the customers need a "permit" from the chief of a tribe, or else the land would be overrun by intruders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>Wow! So it's like the entrance gate into Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>This road is connected to each tribe's village. It should be easy to get to any one of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>Um...what did you mean earlier when you called it a neutral trading village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>Ah. In Saga, the individual tribes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>They are roughly divided and belong to one of three factions based on their code of conduct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>There are deep chasms between each faction and, unless you have a valid reason, you can't move freely between villages of different factions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>That being said...there are some things that just can't be supplemented for within an individual community, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>Oh...so it's a village where anyone can enter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>Yep. It's a neutral area that goes beyond tribe or faction where you can obtain whatever it is you are lacking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>That's what a neutral trading village is. It's a village where individuals from any faction can come and go as they please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>I thought it would be the perfect place to first take a foreigner like you, young lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>So, even though it's a place of freedom, there's still quite a bit of friction going on here. What are the three factions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>There's the "Tehre of Earth" faction that merchants like myself belong to that actively tries to incorporate new cultures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>Then there's the "Fuu of Fire" faction that is a warlike tribe responsible for Saga's military.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>Finally...there's the nature-worshiping faction called the "Voda of Water." They place an emphasis on training new shamans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>Tehre...? Fuu...? Voda...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>They're the names of the three great shamans they call the Sprite Trio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>Tehre is the shaman of earth...Fuu is the shaman of fire...and Voda is the shaman of water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>And they're the ones who manage the artifacts called Matter, which resemble Philosopher's Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>In the past...the Wind Sprite also existed...and together they were called the Sprite Quartet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>Wa-wait...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>There's so much to learn. Why didn't you tell me all of this during the trip?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>Weren't you the one who told me not to talk to you because you were feeling sick?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>Sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>In any case, the Sprite Trio consists of the three ultimate shamans gathered from amongst the various tribes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>Essentially, they are supposed to work hand-in-hand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>Unfortunately, due to their beliefs, I would be hard-pressed to say they were united. That's the current state of the tribes in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>How could that happen? You're all from the same land of Saga.</td>
