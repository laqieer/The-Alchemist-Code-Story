<td>Are you sure it's okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What is okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Leaving the village. Now that Chief Adone has died, you're the chief, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The village is protected by the Elder and the support of all the villagers...it will be all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>For starters, you were the one who wanted to take me with you, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Right. If we can revive the power of the wind...of Matter, we should be able to suppress the outbreak of Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I want to protect Saga. That feeling still hasn't changed, but...when I think about your tribe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. It was my father's wish for me to leave the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Not that I have any idea how all of this will end up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You're strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>With Chief Adone dead, I thought you might be discouraged, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My father said he'll always be watching over me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>He still lives in my heart. I have nothing to mourn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Heh. Don't worry. I'm sure it'll all work out. We'll do everything we can to restore the wind...agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ye-yeah... If I can overcome the pain and fever, I should be fine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That being said, the time is approaching. We must hurry to Voda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>First of all, let's take a break in the village. We're almost there, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Paza village, huh? I've always wanted to go there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's got one of the biggest markets in all of Saga, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It faces the main road that connects with the other villages. For the tribes around here, it's something of an intersecting village. It should still be flourishing more than ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It should still be...? Don't you always pass by it when you visit Voda?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I usually avoid Paza village and go through the forest. The reason why we're heading there now is so that you can get some rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You usually avoid Paza village...? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Paza is a neutral trade village where people from different tribes come and go. Because of that, the strife between tribes never ceases there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We of the Voda faction dislike conflict. That is why we avoid the Paza village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>There is strife between the tribes even in the famous Paza village with its free market?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes. In order to avoid any unnecessary conflict, my father often told me not to go near Paza village if possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If you had the physical strength to make it through the forest, I wouldn't be stopping by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I see. Naturally, there'll be plenty of merchants at the marketplace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We may be able to gather information regarding the outbreak of Jam. We're almost there, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Wait here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...?! Where are you going...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It'll be faster to confirm how far we are from on top of a tree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Wh-whoa! No wonder they call the Voda faction the guardians of the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That being said...it's hard to believe that the strife has spread to the point that even they are shunning this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I can see it! It shouldn't take more than 20 minutes for us to get there. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Bleeaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Honestly...I've never had a customer who got so dragon-sick before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Aren't those broomsticks that you witches ride on a lot more uncomfortable?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We...well, this dragon...it shakes and smells like a beast...and...bleeaaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Gluah...you're making me feel sick too. Anyway, we've arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>This is Paza village. It's a fairly large one where a market is held.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Paza village... I've finally arrived...in Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>So this is Saga! Wow! There's a lot of people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Paza village starts from around here. It's a neutral trade village with a vast marketplace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What do you mean "from around here"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>This village of Paza was formed when people began to gather and form a market along the main road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>In theory, the center of the town is a little further ahead, but there are no clear territorial boundaries. There are a lot of villages like that in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's why even the customers need a "permit" from the chief of a tribe, or else the land would be overrun by intruders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wow! So it's like the entrance gate into Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>This road is connected to each tribe's village. It should be easy to get to any one of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Um...what did you mean earlier when you called it a neutral trading village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ah. In Saga, the individual tribes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>They are roughly divided and belong to one of three factions based on their code of conduct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>There are deep chasms between each faction and, unless you have a valid reason, you can't move freely between villages of different factions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That being said...there are some things that just can't be supplemented for within an individual community, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Oh...so it's a village where anyone can enter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yep. It's a neutral area that goes beyond tribe or faction where you can obtain whatever it is you are lacking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's what a neutral trading village is. It's a village where individuals from any faction can come and go as they please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I thought it would be the perfect place to first take a foreigner like you, young lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>So, even though it's a place of freedom, there's still quite a bit of friction going on here. What are the three factions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>There's the "Tehre of Earth" faction that merchants like myself belong to that actively tries to incorporate new cultures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Then there's the "Fuu of Fire" faction that is a warlike tribe responsible for Saga's military.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Finally...there's the nature-worshiping faction called the "Voda of Water." They place an emphasis on training new shamans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Tehre...? Fuu...? Voda...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>They're the names of the three great shamans they call the Sprite Trio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Tehre is the shaman of earth...Fuu is the shaman of fire...and Voda is the shaman of water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>And they're the ones who manage the artifacts called Matter, which resemble Philosopher's Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>In the past...the Wind Sprite also existed...and together they were called the Sprite Quartet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Wa-wait...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>There's so much to learn. Why didn't you tell me all of this during the trip?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Weren't you the one who told me not to talk to you because you were feeling sick?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>In any case, the Sprite Trio consists of the three ultimate shamans gathered from amongst the various tribes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Essentially, they are supposed to work hand-in-hand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Unfortunately, due to their beliefs, I would be hard-pressed to say they were united. That's the current state of the tribes in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>How could that happen? You're all from the same land of Saga.</td>
</tr>
