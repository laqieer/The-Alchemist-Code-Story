<td>...Hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>How long are you gonna sleep for? Hurry and get up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Mm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You finally got up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey, you haven't forgotten the face of your business competitor, have you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's not what I'm asking you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm asking what the Vice-Captain of the Sand Hawks is doing here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm here for work, of course. Who would come here out of their own volition?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I see. Then hurry up, finish your work, and leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Seriously. Just when I was dozing off comfortably...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I still haven't finished talking to you yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? What are you talking about? Didn't you have work to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Unfortunately...my work involves you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh?! What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Don't get so worked up. If I was after your life, I would've taken care of it while you were asleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>My job is to bring you back to the Guild.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Are you an idiot? Why would I believe such an outlandish tale?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Here's the contract.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Is that the Guild's emblem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's because you're coming in and out of a Special A-Class Danger Zone like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's up to me where I choose to rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I got a request to bring you back because of your actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What they did was unnecessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well, anyway, that's why I'm here. According to my contract, I'll bring you back by force if I have to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hmph. Sorry, but I have no intention of following you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm gonna stay and relax here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm here for work. Sorry, but what you want isn't my priority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Tsk. Here comes a monster. This is on you for wasting my time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm the merchandise, right? In that case, you'd better be careful not to harm me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What are you talking about? According to my contract, it doesn't matter whether I bring you back dead or alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If you want to get back alive, then you'd better protect yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well then, let's start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The worst rendezvous in history!</td>
