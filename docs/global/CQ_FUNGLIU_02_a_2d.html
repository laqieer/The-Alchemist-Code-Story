<td>A human...weapon?</td>

<td>Yes...but...those are Greed Dike soldiers out there. It's dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>All the more reason for me to answer the door.</td>

<td>033</td>
<td>It's unacceptable for Greed Dike soldiers to act in such a manner here in Lustburg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Polin, it's dangerous!</td>
