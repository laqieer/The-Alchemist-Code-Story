<td>Grooooooarrrgghhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I spotted an opening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This is our chance! Little lady, are you ready for this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>L-let's go! Our goal is right in front of us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Then let's finish this!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>GroooOOOOOogghhhh—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>――――</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We did it! Now we just have to purify the core—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Whew, thanks for sparing me the trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That voice, here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I thought I'd come and see if you guys needed some help, but you wrapped it up so quickly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Though I got to say, little sloppy, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Don't complain. Even if I had been able to create a path, I couldn't have joined you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Guess I should do my job... Newbies have it so hard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ignacio! What are you planning to do with the core?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh, piqued your curiosity? We would like to use it, of course. Silly Pursuers of Sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's just like I was told, I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You Sephira really will do anything to save people, even if you destroy the world in the process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hand over the core! If the corruption within were to leak out this whole area would be—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh, I know that all too well, but I'm afraid it's all a necessity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>As you know, the Ira Belt is right on brink of destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...Serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So that was your plan? Were you the ones who made the king succumb to corruption?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oi, Ignacio, can you cut the jabber? I can't keep the pathway open much longer. Get back in here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah, I got it. Well then, everyone, I hate to cut our time so short, but I bid thee adieu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm feeling a little magnanimous today, so here's a little warning. If you Pursuers intend to visit the Ira Belt, you better watch your step out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That land has long since become a rather lawless place after all—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If you approach it as sloppily as you did the other lands, you might just find that your luck runs out this time around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...Nrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Nimul, we've got to get on the airship and evacuate. Leviathan's defeat is making the ocean go out of control... The ocean currents are picking up speed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So it's creating one final massive wave?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Exactly. If that happens it'll swallow up our ice path too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm lowering the ship! Everyone get aboard quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You say that, but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh? Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This isn't good! Those two will get swept awa—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Bzzp bwrip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ah... That sound...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>They didn't fall into the sea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Oh. I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Bwrii bwriizp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Selsieg! That means that—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh, thank goodness, I made it in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...Don't overdo it, Nicaea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Of course. My apologies, Imnus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Lady Nicaea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You have done well, Daphne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>No, this victory is a shared one. I couldn't have done it without everyone here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh, that's not what I meant to say at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I mean... You finally managed to stop dwelling on your worries rather than looking forward, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You look just like Imnus and my father. Like someone who can fight to protect others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I-I look like the Captain and His Highness...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You are my beloved, wonderful Shield Maiden. I am so proud! Why, I'd say more than anything else—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Please, my lady, I am not worthy of such praise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Oh come on, I'm going to get sad if a friend of mine keeps acting that terribly humble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Huh? Your...friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Oh dear, here I was thinking about how I wanted to be friends this entire time... Is that a problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>N-not at all! It'd be an honor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...Good, it seems like we didn't lose anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Let me extend my gratitude in place of my liege. Without your assistance, we'd all have perished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>We are also grateful for the warm welcome we received, but I'm afraid that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...Yes, it appears our fight isn't over yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>At the very end we were faced with another problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>King Arius... He was clearly being manipulated by someone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>How unfortunate that my problems insist on multiplying...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I must find out what happened in the Ira Belt while I was gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Andechs...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Oh, sorry, I'm really spoiling that sweet hard-won victory vibe we had going here, huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We should be happy about this win. At least this area won't be terrorized by Leviathan any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I'd say that's definitely worth celebrating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Yeah, that's true enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>At least the Invidia Belt no longer has to deal with that threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>This is a joyous moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>With the Cursed Beast defeated, the Invidia Belt will be able to enjoy some fleeting moments of peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>But the Leviathan's corruption-filled core fell into the hands of the Infinite Serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>We'll have to set our sights on that blistering scorched landmass next, the Ira Belt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>That's where we will witness it... The end of this world.</td>
</tr>
