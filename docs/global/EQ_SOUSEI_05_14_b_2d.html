<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>As you know, the Ira Belt is right on brink of destruction.</td>

<td>...Serpent.</td>

<tr>

<td>So that was your plan? Were you the ones who made the king succumb to corruption?!</td>

<td>Oi, Ignacio, can you cut the jabber? I can't keep the pathway open much longer. Get back in here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah, I got it. Well then, everyone, I hate to cut our time so short, but I bid thee adieu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>I'm feeling a little magnanimous today, so here's a little warning. If you Pursuers intend to visit the Ira Belt, you better watch your step out there.</td>

<td>That land has long since become a rather lawless place after all—</td>

<td>If you approach it as sloppily as you did the other lands, you might just find that your luck runs out this time around.</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>King Arius... He was clearly being manipulated by someone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>How unfortunate that my problems insist on multiplying...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
