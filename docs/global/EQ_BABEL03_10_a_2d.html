<td>What is this? You think getting more people involved is going to help?! You're all just toys for me to play with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Things are getting out of hand. If this is going to take time, we should retreat for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What?! We came all this way, and you want to leave?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Remember, we were told not to let our presence be made public. This needs to be dealt with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ryle, you—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I came here to ensure the safety of my property. I'm not here for some high-and-mighty crap like protecting people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Nefertiti, we know you have a lot on your plate. I'm not crazy enough to say I'll help you deal with your issues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Then...why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I just can't let these fiends have their way. There's nothing I hate more than cleaning up messes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Although, I'm not quite lazy enough to lay around while some miscreant is marauding in my domain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ryle...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Lucian, Retzius...change of plans. I take back the order to protect Carla.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What are our new orders?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Protect our home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ryle... I knew one day the seeds of Hawk's will would take root even in you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hmph, get up. Carla, you too! If I don't get to lie down, none of you get to either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Uh, right! Ryle... Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm not here to help you. Get that through your head, okay? I'm a selfish, selfish sod with ulterior motives...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But I'll tolerate having you along with me on this fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hehehe. Isn't that what we call helping each other out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wow, we really won't know what'll happen unless we try. Just like Hawk said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yeah, this must be what Hawk wanted to see happen someday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I didn't think it would be possible to come to this without officially banding together as a unified country, but I guess I was wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Haha! Now we just have to win! If we lose here, we'd be acting—um...what's that word... Negligent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I-I don't think that word means... Never mind. Ramses, are you ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes! If that's what she, the sweet angel of the desert, asks of me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Master Ryle, may I join you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Do you really have to ask? Lucian, Retzius, you have your orders. Well, I guess it's been a while since I did any sort of exercise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It doesn't matter how many of you insignificant fodder there are! Prepare yourselves! I'll gorgeously scatter your remains across this desert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm gonna crush you all to pieces!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Balt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I know. We have to win for Hawk's sake, and for everybody who lives in this desert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>For our home! We can't let them trample these sprouts that are about to bloom! Let's go!</td>
