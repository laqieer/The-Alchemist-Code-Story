<td>We weren't even the ones who hurt it! It's not listening at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Seeing its own child hurt has made it lose its mind. I want it to calm down so it'll listen to us, but how do we do that with such a big Ratty?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh! The trees! The trees, Hayate! If we climb the trees and try to calm it down from above, maybe it'll buy us some time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Right! In that case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(There should be an old, giant tree near by! If we lead it there, then—!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oi, over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Numa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Okay, if it's from this high up... Hyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Numa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You did it! You hit it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Nu...ma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh no! Rin, look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Grrr, if only I could make it in... Instant Tanuki Teleportation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>R-Rin, are you all right? Sorry about that. I couldn't stop my momentum...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That was so much fun! Was that your technique?! That's amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh, oh, that's... I guess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It was so cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You handled the Ratty situation and saved me! You're so cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>R-really? N-no, I'm not cool or anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I didn't even think of climbing a tree in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>And it was a fifty-fifty toss up whether my technique was going to work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Then it was our win together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Even though I thought of climbing a tree, I wouldn't have been able to do it on my own. And I almost got squished, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Thank you so much, Hayate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No, thank you. It's thanks to you that things went well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I wasn't annoying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You're never annoying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That's good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Watching you try your best made me want to help you, too. I'm so glad I got to help you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Th-thanks. But I've still got a long way to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's not true at all! You were so cool that—whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Are you okay?! You're surprisingly clumsy, Rin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hehehe, I did it again. Sometimes my friend gets mad because of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Be more careful, would you? Sigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I have to get stronger so I can protect her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hm? Did you say something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>N-no, nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You really saved my bacon today. I suppose getting help from someone isn't all bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>See!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It feels good to know someone's got your back and getting help allows you do things you couldn't do alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It's a win-win situation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Heh. Trying it out, I finally see you're right. You're...an amazing person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(What I need right now is not to struggle on my own, but to rely on the right people to guide me on the road to growing stronger.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's thanks to you that I've made up my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I am going to become a special soldier so I can go with you to the human village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You'll come to the village with me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Y-yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Yay! Then we'll be able to hang out there together! And I won't be alone when we go home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>This is going to be so fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>No, that's not what I'm saying! I'm not going for fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Protecting you... That's why I'm going to get stronger!</td>
</tr>
