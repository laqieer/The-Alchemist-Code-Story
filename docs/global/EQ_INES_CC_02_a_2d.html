</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nasa.png" alt="Nasario" height="128"><br>Nasario</td>
<td>But at least outwardly, and inasmuch as I can tell from introductions alone, you do not fit any of these categories. I can't read your motives at all. As such, I find you rather curious.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/claris.png" alt="Claris" height="128"><br>Claris</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/claris.png" alt="Claris" height="128"><br>Claris</td>
<td>But that's why this festival is so important. We need to better understand each other's pain, mourn our collective losses, and pledge never to repeat the tragedies of the past.</td>

<tr>

<td>Thank you so much! That means a lot to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nasa.png" alt="Nasario" height="128"><br>Nasario</td>
<td>Be that as it may, however, I would ask that you rein in your curiosity a bit. It will be difficult to rely upon you as a guide if you cannot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/claris.png" alt="Claris" height="128"><br>Claris</td>
<td>Right. Sorry. Again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nasa.png" alt="Nasario" height="128"><br>Nasario</td>
<td>You will be leading us to the royal capital, no? The journey ahead is a long and treacherous one. And it will be doubly so if we are unable to trust you along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ines.png" alt="Ines" height="128"><br>Ines</td>
<td>Now hang on just a moment, Nasario! There's no reason to be so rude, and...blunt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/claris.png" alt="Claris" height="128"><br>Claris</td>
<td>No, no, it's my fault for displaying such poor tact. I am not offended, I assure you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/claris.png" alt="Claris" height="128"><br>Claris</td>
<td>And from this point on, I shall proudly and dutifully guide you to the royal capital, so please do not be concerned even one moment longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/claris.png" alt="Claris" height="128"><br>Claris</td>
<td>Shall we be off, then? I have a carriage waiting for us just beyond the edge of the forest.</td>
