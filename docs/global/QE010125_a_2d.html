<td>Lord Gabirond! We've managed to grasp the movements of the Blue Flame Guard under Zeke!</td>

<td>They are currently near Old Fort Agilev, advancing across the wastelands called the "Ruins of Death."</td>

<td>Fort Agilev...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's a fort that used to belong to Wratharis.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I will! Even if we must cross swords, I will correct my father's sins!</td>
