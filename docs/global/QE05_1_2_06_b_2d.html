<td>Wow!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This is it! The last one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Man, but when did the Jam start getting this aggressive? Things have changed a lot since I was a kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Has the seal on the Sacred Stone really become so weak?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>This is definitely becoming a problem. Gluttony can't hold off the Jam without the power of the Sephira that is capable of destroying them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>With this civil war going on, if a bunch of these show up and start eating everyone out of house and home, there's not much we'll be able to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I said as much to General Leordas of the Liberation Army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>When the fertility of the fields in the South was lost, the balance of this country was destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The destruction of this land was not all at the hands of us humans, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If not for the Sacred Stones, this level of catastrophe would not be possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Kamui...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I am no soldier, no noble, and certainly no king. There is nothing I can do for a war waged between people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>However, there is something I can do about the Sacred Stone in this country... There must be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh. That face says that you've made some sort of big choice. Careful that it doesn't get stuck that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes... Isidore, I have decided to pursue the role of Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Protector... The role my father once held?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't really know that much about it, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Nice! Sounds like Chief Iakov has finally come to recognize you as one of us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>One of...? What does that mean? I thought Kamui was already one of the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Did I not tell you? I am like you, one who joined the Sephira village from the outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>There is a blood connection, but a weak one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It wasn't until I came to the Sephira village that I understood this mark, this sephirah, that is upon my body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I lost my family to nature and happened upon the hidden village while wandering the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I remember feeling that it hadn't all been for nothingâ€”that all that had happened was for a reason, and that reason was for me to find the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Instead of "finding" us, it might be more accurate to say that you "returned" to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>For what it's worth, I've always seen you as one of the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ha. Thank you, old friend. You don't change, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm so proud of you! My boy, stepping into his own, taking his place among our people! Brings one to tears. You're one of us, too, Hisham! Don't forget it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I-I won't!</td>
