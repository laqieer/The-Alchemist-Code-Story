<td>Wha...?!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Finally awake? This is a really bad time to be oversleeping, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Sorry! What's the situation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Demons have breached our walls. Captain Ugachi and Captain Tanosuke are leading the counteroffensive at the entrance, but they can't keep all of them out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And inside?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I finished most of the work myself while you were off in dreamland!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hmph. With their numbers dwindling, they're starting to get reckless. It's become quite easy to see through their ruses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...So, are you going to tell me what happened? I'm guessing that was no ordinary sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're right. It wasn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Just another random, disorganized assault? I don't get it. Either way, everybody stay on your toes! Watch out for Hidden Ogres!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The same trick won't work on us twice. Let's make sure they understand that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Whoa! Captain Ugachi! Heads up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Quite the commotion, isn't it? Do you require my assistance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ah, it would appear that demons have breached the line, so my sword may be needed within. I'll leave things here to the two of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Just like that, huh? And by himself, no less. What do you make of it, Captain Ugachi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Not much I'd care to say out loud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But we have to clean up this mess before we can worry about that one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yeah, I guess we do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Celis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Let's wrap this up quickly, and then get some answers out of Judius. Give it everything you've got, so we don't waste any more time than we have to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Captain Ugachi is right. But I don't think he realizes what "giving it everything I've got" would entail. If I were to answer that voice, I'm sure I'd have more to give...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Strength... I must gain the strength...to protect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(...but I wouldn't be able to come back from it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hah. Of course! I've never given any less than my all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmph. Whatever you say. Let's go!</td>
