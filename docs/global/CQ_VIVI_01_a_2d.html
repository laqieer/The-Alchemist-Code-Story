<td>All right! The day's work is done. Time to hit the town and find something to eat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey, Vivi! Come here for a sec. Are you still in contact with the Supreme Commander?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The top brass want information on her. Give me something, will ya? Anything will do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Anything? That's vague. Who wants what, now? Try being more specific, or I can't really tell you anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is top secret information, but I guess I'll tell ya. A recently appointed Officer of hers has had some kinda backroom dealings with one of ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The dealings actually aren't all that important. It's the relationship itself that could cause trouble. Depending on how this comes to light, we may need to be prepared to react.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I see. I don't have any information on that. Sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'll keep it in mind, though. If I notice anything, I'll let you know! See you around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Information about Mei Fang, huh? I guess she is the Supreme Commander of Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Whereas, I'm a spy for Wratharis. I guess it is pretty weird that we're friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Ah, thinking about Mei Fang makes me want to see her again! I might have to go pop in for a visit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Reporting! It seems that Wratharis' National Secret Ops has begun collecting information on the Officer you recently appointed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We have also become aware of the presence of assassins. We advise you to be wary of any unidentified persons in the area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Understood. You may leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wratharis' National Secret Ops... So long as Vivi is not involved, I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hey, Mei Fang! How's it going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Vivi. You're as impertinent as ever, I see. I am well, as always. And you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, I'm all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What is it? Is something troubling you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ah! No! I'm fine! I'm great, actually!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see. I would like to talk to you, but I have a war council scheduled. I will be leaving shortly. What will you do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well, I just wanted to come and see you. I guess I did that, so I might go home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hmm... I see. All right, then. Goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yeah! See you later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'll see her off, at least. I should be able to watch her from the roof.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There she is! I've got a perfect view from up here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>H-hey! What's he...? Hey! Mei Fang! Behind you, there's—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I am well aware!</td>
