<td>But, how?! Last time I saw you, you were—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You think I could stand to just sit by wallowing in defeat? All it took was a bit of training and rehabilitation, and I'm good as new.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But, your arm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>As Second Captain of Blade Fox, I'm not about to let losing an arm prevent me from fulfilling my duties!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well, you certainly haven't changed, have you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's some frightening precision. That blade is being held at just the right angle to lop off someone's head, cleanly and with little effort. Looks simple, but it takes serious training to learn that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What are you doing? We're withdrawing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But... Can't we win?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I can't take on every single one myself. Maybe if you fell in line a bit more, we could eke out a victory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah, that's no way to talk to a lady, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Even so, your judgment may be spot on. Question is, if we're withdrawing, where are we withdrawing to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Shut up and follow me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...Home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The Blade Fox! You're all okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't know if I'd say we're okay, considering how much our numbers have dwindled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But the Demon Elimination Corps, Blade Fox, is still at least hanging in there. And we'll continue to do so, if only out of respect for those who've made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So this is...everyone? All under your command?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Jubei and I share command over what little regiment we have left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Jubei?! Whereabouts might she be? And... Umm, Captain Ugachi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Even without your arm, can you... Uhh, that is to say, are you...still able...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I know what you're trying to say, rookie. Next time, just get your words together and say it. Don't be so mealy-mouthed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Gah! So abrasive! Yet strangely nostalgic...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Jubei is currently out on another mission. We knew you'd be returning shortly, so the timing seemed apt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And you needn't worry about me. I only require one arm to wield a blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>How could I live with myself if I didn't fight—if I didn't do everything I could to uphold her memory?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Then hurry up and give me your report, rookie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>All right, I've been mostly quiet so far, but I don't think I like your tone of voice with Amane very much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...You can start by explaining to me just who this irritating man is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>He looks more like a rooster than a soldier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You've got some nerve, you know that?! I barely know you and my blood's already boiling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Good. Maybe you can channel that. We wouldn't have any use for you if you couldn't fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm not sure where you came from or what your story is, but we'll have to see if you're truly ready for what's to come when you stick your neck in Wadatsumi's business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Edgar! Captain Ugachi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Bring it on. Hope I don't leave you crying too hard in front of your troops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>And I hope you can back up all that bluster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>How did it come to this...?</td>
</tr>
