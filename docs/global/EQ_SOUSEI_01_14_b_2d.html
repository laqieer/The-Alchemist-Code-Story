<td>Aahhh...mortal. I pray unto thou... Forgive me...for I...have...sinned.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This is it... The final core of the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Will you cleave it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There's no need. It is no longer plagued by the corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Whoa! What the hell was that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The dragon has lost its final core—it's beginning to deteriorate. If we don't do something quickly, we'll be trapped!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Then what are we waiting for?! We need to run! Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Right. We've come too far. I'm not about to die here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I will save them all myself! This region, Sephiron, the Sephira people...and Emmel! I will not allow any of them to come to harm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Emmel...? What are you doing here?! Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>N-Nimul... Julia... Julia is...!</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Look, guys, we've gotta go! Hold on tight, okay? We're gonna blast our way out of here at maximum speed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmph... And so...the Great Nidhogg sinks into its eternal slumber amidst the Forest of Suga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>All living beings, regardless of their might, will one day return to the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Their spirit will in turn nourish new life, and the cycle will go on, creating order anew for all the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Nothing is wasted under the circle of life.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I get that you're upset, but can we get back to the village now? I mean, the Matter is complete, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It is. All that is left is for us to return and put an end to the tyranny of the Cursed Beast, once and for all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hold on... What is that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What's the matter, Waginau?</td>

<td>Look! Over there, in the direction of the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Nidhogg...is no more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Twas the last friend that mortal filth has known for some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hence...the time of the covenant has passed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Mortals... Filth thrown unto the world... Know that no one is left to watch over your fruitless floundering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>All that remains for you is my way... My salvation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Now, it is time. Awaken! Sins borne of mortal flesh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Unto the mortals, you will bring nothing less than their deserved punishments...and thereby save the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wh-what is that? It looks like something's falling from the Cosmic Egg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Nnngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Emmel...?! Are you all right?! What's wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wh-what's...? My...head...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The time of...awakening? N-no! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Emmel! Wake up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What?! What is that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>S-something just...popped right out of the ground and...woke up the Cursed Beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The Light of Judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What?! Have you seen this before?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Unfortunately...yes. My homeland was destroyed by light just like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What? Not by the Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No... I don't know anything about the light myself, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Damnit! Adaleigh, turn this ship around! We need to get as far away from the village as possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh? But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaarrgghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>No! Aaarrgghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Everything happened in the span of a single moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Our bodies were rent by vibrations and rocked by a thunderous roaring so terrible that it threatened to tear us apart. Everything went dark, until...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Nnnghh... Is everyone all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What was...? Of course... We must have been attacked by Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
