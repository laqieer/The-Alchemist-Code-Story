<td>The horn isn't resonating... Why? I've done everything I was supposed to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Has Sumeragi been broken for too long? No, that can't be possible. It's all right here:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Strike both the sword and horn thrice with uniform strength, bearing the wishes of those for whom you forge it in your heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The horn shall resonate, and become the blade itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>So many people are counting on your return... Please, listen to the wishes in my heart, Sumeragi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Help us defeat the demons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hear our pleas! Don't let Celis' death be in vain. We need your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'd gladly give my life if that's what it takes... So please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Tch. Just when I thought we had things under control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hyaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Your movements are so predictable. But that doesn't even matter right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There. What is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>A broken horn? Whose could this be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Mine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It is... It is my horn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ahh... Aaaah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Aaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Why...? Why isn't it working?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We're running short on time. Hurry up and fix Sumeragi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yeah, hurry it up, Jubei!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What trickery is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wait, Edgar! Tanosuke? Is that you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yep. Sorry about all of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What...is happening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Tanosuke, you moronicâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You said it yourself. There's not much time. I can only hold back Tamba for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm sure you've got a real earful for me, but save it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Fine. Then you say your piece. I know you wouldn't do something like this without a good reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I figured you'd understand, Captain! What I want you all to know is that Tamba's desire to protect is still present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Malice is twisting his mind, though I don't think he even knows it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Or, maybe he just doesn't want to acknowledge it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>So? Are you suggesting we let him loose? Are you trying to get us all killed?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Of course not! Just...believe in him. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Please don't forget who our true enemy is. Rrg... I thought I'd have a little more time than this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The rest is up to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hyaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>He's as irritating as ever. He has no idea the trouble we've gone through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What are you talking about? Get out of my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Every time... Every single time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>He just says whatever he wants and then leaves us in the dust!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ugachi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Stop dawdling! Get Sumeragi fixed! Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But the horn won't resonate. I've followed the procedure exactly, but it just...isn't responding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...You're many things, Jubei, but I never took you for a fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You've piled too much onto yourself. Celis' death was not your fault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That's not true! That's why... That's why I have to defeat the demons in her stead now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What would Celis say if she heard that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What do you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You think that the desire to kill demons will fix Sumeragi? Is that the hope Celis left behind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Think of what it was she wanted to protect. That's exactly what that idiot was just trying to tell us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hmph. Next time we see that Tanosuke, we're going to have some words!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What she wanted to protect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Ask yourself: Who's our enemy? Tamba?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Judius, maybe? He was the one who took Celis' life. But even that's not quite right, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It's the demon known as Malice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'm counting on you, Jubei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What she wanted to protect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>(I see. I had begun wishing for the destruction of the enemy in front of me...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>(But Celis...didn't fight just to kill demons. It was never about that with her.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>(She fought to protect peace. How could I have forgotten something so fundamental?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It seems my young pupil has one-upped me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Then here I pray. Become a blade once more, so that we may protect this land from the demon known as Malice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I will strive to be one who wields my blade not of hatred, but of love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I will protect this land, its people, and its peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I won't forget this again. I will see Celis' wishes made manifest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I will protect the way of life of those who dwell in Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>So I beseech thee, resonate with these proclamations, Treasure Blade Sumeragi, and return to us once more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Ohh! This is it! It's the Treasure Blade Sumeragi! It still needs reforging, but this shine truly is befitting of the name!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Lend me your strength, Sumeragi!</td>
</tr>
