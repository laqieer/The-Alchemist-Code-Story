<td>Hmph, they do seem stronger than normal... But they're still just beasts, and I can take them out all the same.</td>

<td>GRUUUAAAAAAA!!</td>

<td>Judging one's strength by their race is a bad habit of dragons, Schmeier.</td>

<td>I wonder...</td>

<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>But these beasts, they seem to have been corrupted by Magil somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>They seemed almost like dragons. But there was some sort of stagnation within them.</td>

<td>I'm Carnet. I was just...hunting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Oh, are you out here cleaning up these beasts too? Sorry, but we already took out all of the ones in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carnet</td>
<td>That's too bad.</td>

<td>Well then, I'll try somewhere else.</td>

<td>All right. ...Should we bring something back to prove they're dead?</td>
</tr>

<td>...Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/math.png" alt="Matia" height="128"><br>Matia</td>
<td>That's why I said I was gonna cut off their heads. Pretty efficient, right?</td>

<td>A dragon...</td>

<td>I had no idea any still existed in this layer.</td>
