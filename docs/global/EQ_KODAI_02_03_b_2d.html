<td>Hmph, they do seem stronger than normal... But they're still just beasts, and I can take them out all the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>GRUUUAAAAAAA!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What a pathetic roar. You're about to die and that's all you can manage? You should be fighting with every ounce of your being!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...How are you this strong? Are you even human?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Judging one's strength by their race is a bad habit of dragons, Schmeier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>With enough training, anyone can reach this level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I wonder...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But these beasts, they seem to have been corrupted by Magil somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>They seemed almost like dragons. But there was some sort of stagnation within them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You mean this is something even you've never seen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well...I can't make any conclusions just yet. For now, let's just collect a sample and head back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Sure, let's get back to--Who's there!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Busted...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Umm, who are you exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm Carnet. I was just...hunting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh, are you out here cleaning up these beasts too? Sorry, but we already took out all of the ones in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's too bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well then, I'll try somewhere else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, well, be careful out there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What is it, Matia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(That girl just now.. I could sense her bloodlust. It wasn't aimed at the beasts...but Schmeier.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Come on, let's get back to town for our reward. We can talk about what's next after we get back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>All right. ...Should we bring something back to prove they're dead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's why I said I was gonna cut off their heads. Pretty efficient, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>A dragon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I had no idea any still existed in this layer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...I should probably report this back to Aedith.</td>
