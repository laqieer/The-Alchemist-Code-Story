<td>How about it?! Did you see the power of my artillery?! My own abilities frighten me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Well then! Let's go for a little more showmanship!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Megistos, we've received a report from the lookout!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>A battalion of enemy forces is headed to Amis' unit! Furthermore, it appears these enemy forces are moving in from where we positioned earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What?! Wait, if we'd stayed and protected our position...</td>

<td>Argh! What have I done! I should've listened to what she said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>At this rate, even my beloved ammunition will run dry. Let's go, guys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ack... This isn't looking good...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>?! Artillery?! From where?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What accurate shooting in! In this intricate terrain, they've managed to pinpoint just the enemy forces...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There's only one person who could be responsible for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yo!  Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Megistos!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>All right. Fire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're right. I was just thinking about the turret itself, and I lost sight of my surroundings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Turret artillery is fundamentally supposed to serve as ally support. I can't believe I forgot something so simple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sigh. Seriously... It took you long enough. C'mon, hurry and clean everything up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Alrighty! Leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Is Megistos here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wh-what is it? I told you I've repented. I won't act out again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hmm. In that case... Here, give it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh, that blueprint...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Whoa! You finished making the piece in a blink of the eye! So this is magic...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>All right. Is it okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yeah! It's perfect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Just be sure that you refrain from using the development budget in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm gonna attach this thing without a moment's delay! You people help out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No doubt there will now be amazing improvements in both distance and accuracy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm starting to get worked up... We'll begin right away with mass production. First of all, I'll need to work on reducing the weight though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Seriously! You're not listening again!</td>
