<td>Move it!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Tch! Where did these guys come from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I will show no mercy to those who disrupt the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We thank you for your cooperation. We've been having trouble catching these poachers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>So long as the forest is safe; that is all I need. I leave the rest to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Now, a promise is a promise. We caught those poachers, so it's time you accepted my challenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I never promised anything. Besides, as I've told you, I have no reason to fight you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ugh! You're a stubborn one. Almost as bad as that monk. Do we really need a reason to fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Say what you will. This is my creed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Creed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>All those who fight must have a creed to live by. I choose to fight for the forest's sake, and I will not exert my strength for any other cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Gaining power for the sake of power is different from gaining power for a specific purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Strength for the sake of the forest, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Sorry, little ones. That must've been frightening. You're safe now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>In order to protect all of you and every other life in this forest, I promise you that I will become stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Averting your eyes from what you must become, allowing your rage to drive you... How is this different from a child throwing a tantrum?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This is why you must become stronger, Tsang Lei. You have the potential to surpass my expectations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Should you succeed, that would be proof that my words have reached you. I wait anxiously for that day to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Tch! I guess I really was just dancing like a puppet for him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't have anything so noble as a creed to call my own, but I just can't stand losing like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So I'm gonna travel the world, fight formidable warriors I come across to refine my skills, and then show that monk what I'm really made of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Though I cannot agree with your blind pursuit of strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I can respect it as your creed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Creed? I just said I don't have one of those.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh really? Your eyes tell me otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmph. I guess I get it now. I finally see that that stupid monk was the only one who ever really cared to look at me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well, I'll make that monk recognize me. Forget all that complicated creed nonsense. I'm just going to get stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm sure there are other ways to come to an understanding with him besides fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But...I suppose that is simply your truest desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It is. It is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Are you heading back to the temple, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Not yet! I have to surprise him with power beyond anything he has ever imagined!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>For I am he who lays waste to all those who stand against him! I walk the path to becoming the strongest man alive!</td>
