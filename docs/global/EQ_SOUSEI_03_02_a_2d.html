<td>Ugh... Why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What's wrong, Adaleigh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I-Icona?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yep! It's your big sis! Did the others bully you again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Th-they...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm not a genius or anything. I try my best, I study and work hard...but they...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>They all say I'm just lucky to be born, that it doesn't count if I'm just smart...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, that's just rude of them! You know, crying like this only makes it worse, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You're only going to encourage them if you let them get to you! When they come at you with the same line again, you smile and tell them this:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If only you were smarter than me, then maybe you'd have something more interesting to say!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wake up, Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh...? I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Thanks! I got some excellent data!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But, Adaleigh, your performance was disappointing... That was a seriously poor showing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You were in charge of designing the default settings for the Engineer Soldiers. You couldn't predict its moves well enough to dodge that attack?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Just talking nonsense, like always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Aside from that, this was truly a revelation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So this is Spiritbonding of the Sephira... It's quite interesting! Especially you, Emmy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>M-me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yep! Nimmy's pretty interesting too, but you're out of this world! I mean, you're the—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah, never mind. I'll get back to work for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Work...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The Mayor's calling me! I have to look over things in the Clock Tower. Being a such a skilled technician is hard work, y'know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You guys can help yourself to anything you need here in the lab. Anyway, toodles!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That girl is really....something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Even then, she's usually much more than...that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That's the norm...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Icona stands on the border between genius and crazy. She expects others to understand things in the same way and at the same level that she does, but they usually don't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>She's definitely an "Ambrosia-type."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So anyway, what will we do first, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ah... Let's start by having a look around town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We still need information about the Cursed Beast and the materials to repair the airship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That's right...! I'll go ahead and put in the order for the materials!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I hope my usual shop is still open.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What?! You can't sell them to me? Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Adaleigh. The material suppliers on the surface have been unreliable lately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Not to mention the mayor. He's moving forward with some project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>At the moment, they're taking almost all useful materials to be used for that project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The mayor himself is planning something? But what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I don't know that much. The Chief Engineer probably knows more than I do. Try asking her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I didn't expect things to be like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Icona... She should have at least warned us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I can't say this has started out well for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Ugh... It would be so much better to have an airship of our own if we're going down to the surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Perhaps I can help with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I got my hopes up when I heard that an enormous ship just docked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm pleased to see that it was you after all, Adaleigh! How've you been? Good to see you alive, you stubborn guy, you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Minario! How've you been?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Isn't it obvious, bro? Pretty good! How're things with you? Any interesting stories?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Of course! We got so much info that it wouldn't fit in a rep—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ahem... May I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ah, I shouldn't make too much of a ruckus in front of your guests! I'm Minario! You're friends of Adaleigh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I am Nimul. Adaleigh has helped us on many occasions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Along with my companions, I've been traveling on Adaleigh's airship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I'm very pleased to meet you! Hmm, glad to see you finally making friends, Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What's that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I just never expected shy little old you to let such a crowd ride your airship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That alone tells me you've been having some pretty damn good adventures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>C-cut it out, Minario! What are you talking about? I'm not shy...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You're blushing! Making new friends is always a good thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'm not sure if I can call them friends. More like comrades, maybe, or...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Comrades? Don't tell me, you lot are also...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You're also trying to defeat the Cursed Beasts, and really change the ways of the world? Haha, this is precious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Are you not surprised?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I am! It's just that, well. Forget it. Everyone has the right to dream, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Oh! Minario, since you're here, I've got a question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You happen to know anything about what the mayor's getting into?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Why would you ask me something like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You're his son, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What was he called? Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The Honorable Mayor Fedele, you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yeah, that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>He was so cheerful a moment ago, but now he looks so gloomy...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Looks like he can't stand to even hear that name. Are they mortal enemies or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>But Adaleigh didn't seem bothered by the name at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Are you in the middle of a fight with him right now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>A fight? Ah, I guess you can say that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>To be honest, I haven't seen the man's face in months.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Why's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It just seems like we've got fundamentally opposing views. Father has had something against me since I became a Special Detective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>What?! You—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hey, don't give me that look... I'm well aware that engineers hate people in my line of work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>The people of this city don't care about anything but their own affairs and their own research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Not a single one cares if they're getting in the way of someone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>But that's why we have to keep a close eye on anyone who might be up to no good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>That makes sense, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Hmm. It must be difficult since there are so many people here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Right. We should be careful as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>In any case, I have no idea what Father might be up to. Probably another harebrained scheme.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Whoops, I got a little sidetracked. You were looking to get materials, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>That's right! I have a list right here. It would help us out a lot if you could somehow—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Don't you worry! I know some people down below that can pull some strings for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Mmhm... Yeah, I can get this stuff, no problem. Where should I send it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Hmm. How about Icona's laboratory?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Right... So you've been hanging around her again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Yeah? Is there some kind of problem with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Never mind. I guess you two are close. It's natural.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>All right! That should do it. It'll take some time but everything should be fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Thanks, Minario!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Don't mention it! We're buddies, so something like this is absolutely no problem!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>We're a little busy right now, but let's find a time to grab a bite together soon! My treat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Sure, I'll be around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Your friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Of course! What's with that doubt in your voice? He's my friend, no doubt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>No, I'm glad. I was worried that we were your only friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Excuse me! I don't think either of you have any room to talk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>We didn't exactly have a lot of options.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>We're working on that now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Still... I don't like the sound of what's going on here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>The leader of this city, with the most advanced technology at his fingertips, is gathering materials from all across the region in secret for some scheme...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>That does sound like something we should be concerned about...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast threatens the whole of this region. I had thought to meet with him at some point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>About the Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Yes. I learned in the Luxuria Belt Region that to fight the Cursed Beasts, we need the assistance of the people of each region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I would like to forge an alliance here as soon as possible, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Hmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I suppose we will need to make an appointment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Yes. Adaleigh, could you show us the way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Are you really sure this is it, Adaleigh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Yeah. This clock tower is the center of Redington.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>The power that keeps the city in the air is managed here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>It's become tradition for the mayor to hold office in the heart of the clock tower because of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Then why aren't there any employees in sight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>The mayor's infamous for not liking people. They say he prefers to entrust everything, including his security and the cleaning, to robots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I see. That's quite curious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>That said, it's weird how quiet it is. There should have been some response already. Maybe the system bugged or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>This place is really quite a sight. Not only do the cities here float, but the towers too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>There is an incantation that can make things levitate, but keeping something this big in the sky isn't easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Magic doesn't solve everything. Luckily, we have a natural resource in this region that can't be found anywhere else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>By "resource," you mean fuel? I can see how levitating something of this size would consume a lot of magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>You'll understand when we get there. I was surprised when I saw it in the Luxuria Belt Region, actually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>At our place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Wait. Something's wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, that motor sound? It's just the Engineer Soldiers in charge of tower security.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Everything's fine. I helped design this place and I've got my personal ID tags, so there's no way they'd attack—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Uh, wait a minute...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Are you sure your ID is good?! Because their weapons are totally locked onto us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>They look to be on a rampage. Is there no way to control it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Wh-what? It's no good, the security system's been overwritten!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>We have no choice but to defend ourselves!</td>
</tr>
