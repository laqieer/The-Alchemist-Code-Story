<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Well then...the question is how will we deal with Tehre.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wait, Fuu. Before that, there's something I need to tell you</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You saved me back there. If it weren't for you, I would've likely lost my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You have my gratitude. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What's gotten into you all of a sudden? There's no need to thank me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So...will you join forces with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There's no need to bother putting it into words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Words can be important at times like this. Besides, we have youngsters here with us as well. So, what do you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Fuu...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Fine. I will indeed join forces with you. Let's protect Saga together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Thank you, Fuu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I told you there's no need to thank me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The situation still hasn't changed. Don't let your guard down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, at least now we can be certain that Tehre and the Gluttony army's goal...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...is to get their hands on the Sacred Stone Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Indeed. That blasted Tehre, what is he thinking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well, when it comes to that brat, he could very well be under the deception of Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I agree. For better or worse, he's an honest kid. There's a possibility that they're exploiting him. That being said, he's a tough one to talk sense into.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Perhaps it has something to do with him being the youngest of the Sprite Trio. He's got quite the imagination and tends to run headlong into things... Now that I think about it, he's always been that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hm. From my perspective, you're still practically a child as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Um...Voda, are you...that much older than Fuu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I am. I am the oldest out of the Sprite Trio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Whoa! I can't tell at all. Actually, there was something I wanted to ask you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>From listening to your stories...it's been quite a long time since the Wind Sprite Alia died, hasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's been about...let's say, 100 years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And even back then both of you and, um, Tehre were Sprites, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I was thinking that all of you...well, you've lived for a super long time. Does everyone in Saga live as long as you do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...Bwahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>How funny. Right, of course, a foreigner wouldn't know about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>In order to serve as a Sprite, you must be appointed before drinking the blood of the Beast Leoferes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It is not very common for one with enough power to be selected as a Sprite to appear. When they do, by drinking the Leoferes' blood, they are promised longevity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ah. I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>During the Lion Monarch's Charge, Tehre had just been appointed Earth Sprite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, it was Tehre who had the hardest time accepting Alia's death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>After all, there was a time when he was greatly fond of Alia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>His grudge against me was equally as great. Perhaps there was a weakness in his heart that the Gluttony army was able to exploit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Then...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Indeed. It'll be quite a task to pull Tehre away from the Gluttony army and bring him back to our side.</td>
</tr>
