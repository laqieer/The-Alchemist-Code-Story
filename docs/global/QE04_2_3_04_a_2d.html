</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/hoo.png" alt="Fuu" height="128"><br>Fuu</td>
<td>I agree. For better or worse, he's an honest kid. There's a possibility that they're exploiting him. That being said, he's a tough one to talk sense into.</td>
</tr>

<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/hoo.png" alt="Fuu" height="128"><br>Fuu</td>
<td>Perhaps it has something to do with him being the youngest of the Sprite Trio. He's got quite the imagination and tends to run headlong into things... Now that I think about it, he's always been that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/voda.png" alt="Voda" height="128"><br>Voda</td>

<td>Whoa! I can't tell at all. Actually, there was something I wanted to ask you.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/hoo.png" alt="Fuu" height="128"><br>Fuu</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>From listening to your stories...it's been quite a long time since the Wind Sprite Alia died, hasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/hoo.png" alt="Fuu" height="128"><br>Fuu</td>
<td>It's been about...let's say, 100 years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>And even back then both of you and, um, Tehre were Sprites, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>I was thinking that all of you...well, you've lived for a super long time. Does everyone in Saga live as long as you do?</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/hoo.png" alt="Fuu" height="128"><br>Fuu</td>
<td>...Bwahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/hoo.png" alt="Fuu" height="128"><br>Fuu</td>
<td>How funny. Right, of course, a foreigner wouldn't know about it.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>In order to serve as a Sprite, you must be appointed before drinking the blood of the Beast Leoferes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/voda.png" alt="Voda" height="128"><br>Voda</td>
<td>It is not very common for one with enough power to be selected as a Sprite to appear. When they do, by drinking the Leoferes' blood, they are promised longevity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>Ah. I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/hoo.png" alt="Fuu" height="128"><br>Fuu</td>
<td>During the Lion Monarch's Charge, Tehre had just been appointed Earth Sprite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/voda.png" alt="Voda" height="128"><br>Voda</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, it was Tehre who had the hardest time accepting Alia's death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/voda.png" alt="Voda" height="128"><br>Voda</td>
<td>After all, there was a time when he was greatly fond of Alia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/hoo.png" alt="Fuu" height="128"><br>Fuu</td>
<td>His grudge against me was equally as great. Perhaps there was a weakness in his heart that the Gluttony army was able to exploit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Then...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/hoo.png" alt="Fuu" height="128"><br>Fuu</td>
<td>Indeed. It'll be quite a task to pull Tehre away from the Gluttony army and bring him back to our side.</td>
