<td>Hi, Logi! Are you done with your duties for today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yeah, I finished up just now. Have you gotten used to this place yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well, there's still a lot that perplexes me. I suppose that's because I still can't remember anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But everybody's so nice to me! Tina in particular seems to really be concerned for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You look...tired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Not at all! Uh... Well, that's a lie. To tell you the truth, I am a bit worn out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I still haven't heard from the Blue Tongues, the friends I've traveled with for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You mean since those blobs attacked?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah. Even with Kamui's network, we can't seem to find them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>O-oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Uhm... Logi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm sure they're fine! I mean, I don't have any basis for saying that, but you just have to believe, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yeah... Yeah, you're right. Thanks, Agatha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>They're doing all right somewhere, and we'll soon be seeing each other again. So for now, I just have to do what I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Captain Logi! Where is Captain Logi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The scouts from the east have reported signs of a group that very well may be the Blue Tongues!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Is that true?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes, sir! It's just...we didn't get much out of the reporting scout before he passed out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The scouts seemed to have been attacked, and he was the only survivor. His wounds are quite serious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I have to go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Captain Logi, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't stop me! My friends could be in danger as we speak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I understand how you feel, but please, go see our boss first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>He's already making preparations for a rescue after hearing the report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>All right! Sorry, Agatha. I gotta go now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Please be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Logi. Good, you're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The scouts were stationed in a ruin northeast of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>They all know how and when to retreat. For them to be decimated like this—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Means such a threat could be facing the Blue Tongues!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>We should hurry. We desperately need their strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Don't get in my way!</td>
</tr>
