<td>...It's over.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes...it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh! Look! I can see the sun! The eclipse is over...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The three look up at the sky...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The rays of the sun begin to unleash even stronger light as they emerge from behind the shadow of the moon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The sun that shines over the continent of Ragna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The sun that warmly glows over the continent of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The sun that watches over the people of Zipangu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Three symbols of our trio's bittersweet memories...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's dazzling...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I guess it's thanks to...Amaterasu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Was this really...how it was meant to be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I know how you feel, but...it was what Amaterasu wished for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There was nothing we could do about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But...the truth is...all of us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Lisbeth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Th-this place...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...! You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Watching you is making me really frustrated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You have the power to change your destiny, but you haven't realized it. You want to save Amaterasu, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>There is still something that can be done. Something still not realized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Something still not realized...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We should try to remember...no, come up with something new.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hmm. I'm not really good at thinking. Oh, Captain, can you think of something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Let me see...Amaterasu said that the captain of this pirate ship can go back and forth between worlds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>She also said that this Golden Compass points to the Twilight Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Amaterasu said it was hers, but if she stays in the Twilight Zone all the time then she shouldn't need it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Now that I think about it... a compass is a necessity for a ship, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's more natural to think of it as a pirate's possession.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Exactly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So it was originally a pirate's possession that was handed over to Amaterasu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Well done, Captain! In other words, the previous captain had sailed to the Twilight Zone before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Are there no records that he left behind? Since this is a ship, there must logbooks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>They have those in the captain's cabin! Just a second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes...there's a record in the logbook of them having gone to the Twilight Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Wait, more importantly, look at this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What's the matter? Did you find out anything new about the Twilight Zone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh...well...we've found out a little more about what the captain thought of Amaterasu, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>There doesn't seem to be any new information regarding the Twilight Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I guess it's not gonna be that easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>But we did find something interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>"When the sun, moon, and world overlap...ride the three drawing forces and move beyond time."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>If we could travel through time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Maybe we could go and save Amaterasu...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Indeed. Well done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>"When the sun, moon, and world overlap"...that's talking about the solar eclipse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>In other words, doesn't that mean right now is the time when we can travel through time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>In that case, we should hurry. The sun is beginning to appear again...the solar eclipse will be over soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I'm not really sure about whether or not we can really travel time, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>With this ship that has traveled through worlds and this Golden Compass that points to the Twilight Zone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>As well as the determination that rests within this pirate hat...I'm sure all of these things will lead us to Amaterasu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>We will travel through time and, this time, we will save Amaterasu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Just so you know, there is a limit to a pirate's power as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Once you travel through time, you cannot reverse it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>In that case...wouldn't it be best if we re-fought our last battle with Kayako?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>No, that would change the situation very little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>We might as well prepare more carefully by returning to when we first met.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>That makes sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hey, little dog?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>When we travel through time...can we only select from within the time period that we knew Amaterasu from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Is it possible to go back to before we met her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That will depend on the power of the pirate who wields it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>If you can firmly imagine where you wish to go to, you can go anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Oh...in that case...it doesn't have to be before the other Sun Keys were stolen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Then we should go back to way before Kayako showed up, that way she won't get in our way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>But then we would have to hold onto the Sun Keys until she attempts to take them...I don't think we can keep them that long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I remember something that Amaterasu said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>She said that the Twilight Zone is protected by the sun so that only she can enter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>The Twilight Zone was engulfed with negative energy that removed the sun's protection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Oh, yeah? All I remember is that she let her guard down...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Kayako aimed for when Amaterasu was busy and she disabled her absolute defense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Kayako's plan was a clever one...but if it's known beforehand, it can be stopped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>That's it. We can go back to right before Kayako attacks and help protect the Sun Keys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It's decided then. Let's go, <p_name>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Let's return to the Twilight Zone, right before the Sun Keys were taken!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>All right. This time we're going to save Amaterasu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>O, once-legendary pirate...give us your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>When positive energy grows stronger, there's a possibility that it will give birth to an even stronger negative energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>An ambitious endeavor like this might be worth trying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>This is the Twilight Zone...but with none of the heavy atmosphere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>The Twilight Zone we know must've been engulfed in darkness because of Kayako.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Amaterasu...oh, there she is! But she doesn't seem to be in very good spirits...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Sigh... Always alone, day and night, night and day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Ohh, everyday I'm just repeating the same thing. There's no stimulation and I get tired...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I'm always alone...but I guess it can't be helped since a lot of people would suffer if there was no sun...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>People wouldn't be able to go on adventures. Isn't that right, Captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>...Um, Amaterasu? Sorry to bother you while you're working...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Eeek?! Wh-who are you people?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You appeared so suddenly! How did you get here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>...You seem really surprised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>...I see. I guess this situation would make it easy to launch an attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>An attack?! N-no...did you come here to steal the Sun Keys?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>No, it's the opposite, Amaterasu! We're here to help you stop the Sun Keys from being robbed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Help?! I don't need your help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>This is the Twilight Zone where I manage the sun. You can't come here without permission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>If you don't leave immediately, I'm going to make you leave with force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>...Oh, in that case, how about we go play somewhere together! You just said you wanted stimulation, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Y-you were listening?! Th-that was just me talking to myself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>It doesn't change the fact that I'm the only one who can enter here! I'm chasing you out now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Please don't do that! Considering how we'll have to engage in battle with Kayako after this, I don't want to use unnecessary power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>We are not your enemies, Amaterasu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>We came to help you from the future. We're your friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Friends...? I have no need for friends...and...I don't have any...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>That's not true! We were called by the future-you and we became friends while traveling across worlds together...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>The future-me? Wait...hey! That hat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Why do you have that pirate hat on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Why? Amaterasu, you're the one that gave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>You prepared the pirate ship for us and you gave me the Golden Compass that leads to the Twilight Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>We used the logbook in the ship as a guide to travel here from the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Umm...something about "the sun and moon and stuff overlap...making three forces or something beyond time..." Wasn't that it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>How do you know about that?! Besides, I keep my cherished Golden Compass close to me at all times...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>There's no way I'd give it to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Is that because it was a gift from the pirate who came here to the Twilight Zone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Eeek! How...how do you know about that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Because it said so in the logbook that the pirate left behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>It said that when he was using the Golden Compass to head for the sun...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>He "met a girl that was like the sun..." I'm sure he was talking about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Huh...do you mean...o-oh, I see...a girl like the sun, huh? Heheh♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Um, Amaterasu, what kind of relationship did you have with the pirate who wore this hat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>A long time ago, there was a pirate ship that arrived here in the Twilight Zone. Just like when you guys came, I was taken by surprise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>The captain of that ship turned out to be a legendary pirate...I found out later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Discovering that I would not leave here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>He delighted me with many stories of his adventures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>As I listened to his stories, it made me long to go on an adventure with him, but I couldn't allow myself to leave my post.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I told him how much I envied his ability to live freely and go on adventures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>In response, he said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>"The reason we live happily is because the sun is in the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Without the sun, no adventure, taste of wine, or experience would be worth it."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Saying this, he thanked me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Those words gave me the will to do my job and made me realize how useful I was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Ultimately, I wasn't able to go on a single adventure with him. But when we last parted, he gave me that hat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>He said it was a symbol that I was one of his crew members...and that, one day, I would also find my own friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>But, you know...my true desire was to be his friend and go on adventures with him, I guess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Then why don't you become our friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>We can go on adventures together! Any trouble you encounter, we can help...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Well...when you put it like that...a part of me wants to go along with it, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>But no! My work is very important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>If I make any mistakes, it can really cause problems through the many worlds. Besides, managing the sun is something I have to do alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>When I remember his gratitude, it keeps me going on my own...I can keep doing my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>If someone were to exploit the management of the sun, it could lead to dire consequences. Okay? So leave now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>It's a good thing to have a strong sense of responsibility, but...if you continue to shoulder all the weight on your own, you'll always be alone, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Ugh?! We-well, that might be true...but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>But what choice do I have?! I can't necessarily trust anyone who tries to get close to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I shouldn't be making friends! I need to keep working hard on my own...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>That's so sad! Don't say that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Yuri's right! If you don't make friends and just work all the time, you'll go crazy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>There are times when I want to be alone and even times when I feel like fighting alone is easier, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Still...having friends is...something good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Even if it were a different time and place than now, we were once your friends, Amaterasu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>That's why we still consider you our friend...are you really sure you don't want friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Well...I mean, all things considered, we've just met and I don't know what type of people you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I understand that, but...how about we start by trusting in each other...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Wh-what was that?! The light just broke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Was that...negative energy?! That negative energy was strong enough to take down the power of the sun surrounding the Twilight Zone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>It looks like Kayako's assault has started. She should appear any moment now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Huh?! What are you people doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Wh-what is going on?! Another intruder in the Twilight Zone...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>We won't let her. That's what we came here for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>How did you know I was coming here?! Well, never mind. Don't get in my way!</td>
</tr>
