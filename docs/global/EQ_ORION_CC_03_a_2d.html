<td>Hyaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>A poor excuse for a lunge, that! Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You took the bait! This is what you should've been anticipating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oho!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I got you! For once, I got the upper ha—aaagh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ngh... How...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Fool. You discarded your weapon! Of course you would come at me bare-handed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Here's your consolation prize, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No! Ghaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Not being a coward anymore and actually defeating me are two very different things. It would pay for you not to let your guard falter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Though you are welcome to just give up, if you'd prefer! I know that's what you're used to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Nnrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I will say, your fighting has improved. I hear tell you volunteered yourself for military service, and have made quite a mark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Your skills have made you the talk of the town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Everyone is convinced either you or I will become the next emperor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What they skirt around is the fact that the other candidates are all useless cowards who only slow us down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I have a long way to go before I can reach your level, but I am well on my way. Tell me, though: how did you hear of my military service? Did you speak of me with His Majesty?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He is my father. I speak with him of many things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Never mind that, though. Come on. We're leaving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What? Where are we—? Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You don't need to know anything. You lost, so you're going to do whatever I say, and you're going to like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...An arranged marriage? With a member of the royal family of Wratharis?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>A blood relative to the royals, but not a direct successor to the throne. The aim here is simply to strengthen the relationship between our kingdoms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You mean to say we're going to Wratharis, right now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>But we don't know how Mammon will react! It's unknown territory! What if the locals are hostile toward me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Being attacked by a successor trying to usurp my position is one thing, but if an ordinary citizen in another land should draw my blood, the result could be catastrophic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'm sure it'll be okay for a few days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>If it weren't, the next emperor wouldn't be able to go on any expeditions at all, ever, and that just doesn't seem right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Besides, you've been wanting to see other lands for some time now, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I suppose any attempts to make you turn back would fall on deaf ears. Are you sure it's okay for it to be only the two of us, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't need a bodyguard, if that's what you're thinking! They just said I needed to bring one other person, so I chose you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Generally, a successor shouldn't be allowed out of the country until after their coronation, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Do the rules truly matter, though? It's not becoming of a lion to hold onto a dream like yours forever, without simply acting upon it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You've never been on a journey like this before, have you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>An unfortunate state of affairs, that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Now's the time to expand your horizons. Look! You've made it to the outside world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This is...Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It is indeed. Do as you please until I return. But don't go causing any trouble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And just what kind of trouble would you expect me to—?! Ugh, left without so much as a hint of hesitation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So, this is what it's like outside Greed Dike. The architecture is different, just like the books said. The people's clothes, too. Are they unique to this place, I wonder?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Food and goods I've never seen, too... To think the climate and topography could change so much even within the Continent of Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>There's so much that I never could have even imagined, were I to continue spending all my days in Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes... It's just as I was told.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Well, I'm here now. I see no reason not to explore a bit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What?! Even all the way out here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Do as you please until I return. But don't go causing any trouble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well, she said not to cause trouble, but she did also say I could do as I please...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You really think you can handle all of us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I didn't make it widely known I was leaving the kingdom. Who told you I'd be in Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Fine, then. Your numbers don't matter, it just means this lion will feast well tonight.</td>
