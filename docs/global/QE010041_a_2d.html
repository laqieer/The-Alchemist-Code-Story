<td>There you are. I'm sure you've heard...we've discovered a settlement where the Wratharis troops have gathered.</td>

<td>There's nothing to regret... You plucked the buds of rebellion. You should be proud of your actions.</td>

<td>There are always two sides to the same coin. Great historical feats, depending on how you look at them, can often be seen as villainous massacres.</td>
