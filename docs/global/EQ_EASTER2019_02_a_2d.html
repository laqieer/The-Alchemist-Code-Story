<td>Purses and jewelry... He stole a lot of different things, but we didn't find a single egg on his person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>A thief at a festival?! That's the lowest of the low!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well... I suppose that would have been a little too easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I wonder if the person who stole the Imperial Easter Egg took it because it looked expensive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If so, rest assured that they will not get off lightly. I cannot believe that someone would try to ruin a festival that everyone has been looking forward to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Not to mention that Neica herself made it, so if someone were to try and abuse its powers, we'd all be in trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>For now, why don't we split up and search? Our priority is to find the egg before the public realize that it's missing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(What's wrong with me? Everyone else is searching for the egg seriously.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(But here I am, half-hoping that the egg will never be found, so that the whole event will be called off.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>All right. Then you and I will search over here, Neica.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh? Wh-what?! Y-you mean I get to p-pair up with you, T-T-Teona?! Wh-why? Is this a dream?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I know that the disappearance of the egg must have come as a shock to you, but I can assure you that this is no dream! Now, let's get moving!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wow! Look at this! There was an accessory inside this egg! It's so cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That looks like something Neica would make! I love her accessories, 'cause they're always in style, no matter how many years pass!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Would you like to keep this one, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh? B-but that's yours! Thanks anyway, but I'm gonna find my own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I can't rely on you for everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Then you've gotta find yourself one so that we can match! These accessories will be our special memory of today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(A special memory, huh...? Those girls really seem to be having a blast together.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Everyone is so absorbed in the thrill of the Egg Hunt! It is all thanks to you, Neica, for making such adorable accessories and eggs for everyone to enjoy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>O-oh! N-no, that's just... I-I mean, I really don't evenâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hold that thought! I just saw something glittering over there. I will investigate it immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ah-hah! Look at this! This egg is beautifully painted and exquisitely decorated!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This can only mean that it must be the one, the only... The Imperial Easter Egg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>O-oh, um... A-actually, that's just one of the regular eggs I made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What?! Regular, you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Y-yes. You see, the Imperial Easter Egg is quite a bit bigger, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You little witch! I dare you to say that again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>A-all right. It's quite a bit bigger than these regular eggs, and... Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm the one who found that egg! Don't you go stealing it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You wish! I saw it first! It's mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You want a piece of me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>W-wow... So people really do fight over the eggs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Indeed! Everyone takes this grand event very seriously!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But that does not mean that fighting can be condoned! Let us put a stop to this, Neica!</td>
