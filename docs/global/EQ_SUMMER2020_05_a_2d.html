<td>W-wait a second! What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pirate C</td>
<td>We commanded them to not attack people and we have been throwing away garbage on the beach!</td>

<td>We're just having them collect the materials we need!</td>

<td>Pirate A</td>
<td>Our ship got damaged in the storm the other day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pirate A</td>
<td>It was run-down to begin with, so it couldn't be helped. And then we ran aground on this shore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pirate B</td>
<td>If we can't fix our boat, we can't return to the sea. So, we started gathering materials on this beach to try to fix it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>You mean the boat at the mouth of the cave? I agree it's very beat up... Wait, you want to fix that?! It's like swiss cheese!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pirate B</td>
<td>She's been well used, I'll give you that. That ship's full of our memories. That's why we want to fix it up and head out on the seas with it again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suzu.png" alt="Suzuka" height="128"><br>Suzuka</td>
<td>Which is why we had them collect the materials we need.</td>

<td>An error?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/albe.png" alt="Albea" height="128"><br>Albea</td>
<td>That's what caused them to not follow orders correctly. Where did you get those Alkaroids?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Huh? We pulled them out of the water from a beached shipwreck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>Th-they were in water? Isn't that, you know, bad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/albe.png" alt="Albea" height="128"><br>Albea</td>
<td>That's definitely the cause of the malfunction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/albe.png" alt="Albea" height="128"><br>Albea</td>
<td>You commanded them to pick up materials while avoiding people as much as possible so as to not bother them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/albe.png" alt="Albea" height="128"><br>Albea</td>
<td>However, those conditions were erased by the error so that their goal only became collection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suzu.png" alt="Suzuka" height="128"><br>Suzuka</td>
<td>I see. That's why they started picking up anything from the beach and attacking people out of nowhere in order to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>They're needlessly sturdy, they'll continue to move as normal despite having errors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pirate C</td>
<td>I had no idea they were bothering people. That's terrible! Oh, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/albe.png" alt="Albea" height="128"><br>Albea</td>
<td>But?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pirate A</td>
<td>But we didn't throw out any trash! We've been piling our trash here. We were going to throw it away later—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pirate A, B, C</td>
<td>It's gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hey! Cut it out! That's important booty—bleck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/albe.png" alt="Albea" height="128"><br>Albea</td>
<td>A-are you okay? That octopus is really mad for some reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>It's probably mad because you all moved in here without asking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/albe.png" alt="Albea" height="128"><br>Albea</td>
<td>So that's why they started coming outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suzu.png" alt="Suzuka" height="128"><br>Suzuka</td>
<td>Maybe they're throwing out the things the pirates have brought in into the sea in protest for stealing their home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/noah.png" alt="Noah" height="128"><br>Noah</td>
<td>What a disaster. Which means the trash is your fault in the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pirate A</td>
<td>Th-that may be true but if we can't fix our ship, we'll lose our home, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/albe.png" alt="Albea" height="128"><br>Albea</td>
<td>You can't get yourselves a new boat? There's tons of better boats out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>It's gotta be this ship. This ship is full of our memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/albe.png" alt="Albea" height="128"><br>Albea</td>
<td>It's really important to you, isn't it?</td>
</tr>

<td>Ooo, ooo! I've got an idea! Albea should fix up their ship!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>Then they won't have to collect materials, they'll leave the cave, and the octopuses will get their home back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pirate A</td>
<td>Y-you will?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/albe.png" alt="Albea" height="128"><br>Albea</td>
<td>If it's this kind of mechanism, I can probably fix it. But in return, you have to stop the Alkaroids and return the things that got stolen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/noah.png" alt="Noah" height="128"><br>Noah</td>
<td>Oh yeah! And the comb, her comb!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Of course we'll give that back, too! Comb... Comb... I don't see it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/noah.png" alt="Noah" height="128"><br>Noah</td>
<td>Really? Did you check everything?! An Alkaroid did take off with it, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/albe.png" alt="Albea" height="128"><br>Albea</td>
<td>It's all right if they can't find it. If they just return the other things that got stolen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/noah.png" alt="Noah" height="128"><br>Noah</td>
<td>No. We will find it. Does it have any other characteristics?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Other characteristics... There is another one but I don't think you'd understand it.</td>
