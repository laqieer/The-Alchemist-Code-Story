<td>Oh! What's going on?! What did we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What did you do? You know what you did! You sent those Alkaroid to attack the beach!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Your actions are threatening the peace of the beach! What with sending the Alkaroids to attack it, all the illegal dumping...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>W-wait a second! What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We commanded them to not attack people and we have been throwing away garbage on the beach!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We're just having them collect the materials we need!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Our ship got damaged in the storm the other day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It was run-down to begin with, so it couldn't be helped. And then we ran aground on this shore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If we can't fix our boat, we can't return to the sea. So, we started gathering materials on this beach to try to fix it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You mean the boat at the mouth of the cave? I agree it's very beat up... Wait, you want to fix that?! It's like swiss cheese!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>She's been well used, I'll give you that. That ship's full of our memories. That's why we want to fix it up and head out on the seas with it again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Which is why we had them collect the materials we need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Then...why are they...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It seems it's true that you gave them orders, but something's causing an error.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>An error?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's what caused them to not follow orders correctly. Where did you get those Alkaroids?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh? We pulled them out of the water from a beached shipwreck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Th-they were in water? Isn't that, you know, bad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's definitely the cause of the malfunction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You commanded them to pick up materials while avoiding people as much as possible so as to not bother them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>However, those conditions were erased by the error so that their goal only became collection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I see. That's why they started picking up anything from the beach and attacking people out of nowhere in order to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>They're needlessly sturdy, they'll continue to move as normal despite having errors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I had no idea they were bothering people. That's terrible! Oh, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But we didn't throw out any trash! We've been piling our trash here. We were going to throw it away later—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh! Look! That octopus is carrying something away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hey! Cut it out! That's important booty—bleck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>A-are you okay? That octopus is really mad for some reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's probably mad because you all moved in here without asking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So that's why they started coming outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Maybe they're throwing out the things the pirates have brought in into the sea in protest for stealing their home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What a disaster. Which means the trash is your fault in the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Th-that may be true but if we can't fix our ship, we'll lose our home, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You can't get yourselves a new boat? There's tons of better boats out there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's gotta be this ship. This ship is full of our memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's really important to you, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ooo, ooo! I've got an idea! Albea should fix up their ship!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Then they won't have to collect materials, they'll leave the cave, and the octopuses will get their home back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Y-you will?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>If it's this kind of mechanism, I can probably fix it. But in return, you have to stop the Alkaroids and return the things that got stolen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh yeah! And the comb, her comb!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Of course we'll give that back, too! Comb... Comb... I don't see it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Really? Did you check everything?! An Alkaroid did take off with it, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It's all right if they can't find it. If they just return the other things that got stolen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>No. We will find it. Does it have any other characteristics?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Other characteristics... There is another one but I don't think you'd understand it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>My brother put a mechanism in it. But only I know of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's just something really small. And not that big of a deal, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm going to fix the boat, so I'll leave the rest to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(You don't really think that, Albea, do you?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>(I've got to roll up my sleeves and find it! But I need a clue... Hmm...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(Glows white... White... Didn't Bertha and Sharon say that the octopuses like collecting white things?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hmm, but where would they take it? Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Is that—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>A power unit failure... This I can do something about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Everyone! Things have taken a turn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What's wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>A lot of octopuses came to the beach and things have gotten out of hand! We can't handle them by ourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>We've received a request for aid! We're going back to the beach, so please come with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Oh no! We must return and defend the beach—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Sorry, but I can't leave this right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I took on this ship repair job as the proprietor of the repair shop Magbea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>If I fix this ship, the pirates will leave here and the octopuses will return to their home. That's why my priority has to be repairing this ship right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I-I see. You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>But we can't just leave you here by yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You'll be so focused on repairing it that you'll be defenseless. That's not safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>N-Noah! Calm down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Our job was supposed to be guarding the beach. And I understand where you're coming from, but the octopuses are really swarming the beach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The Alkaroids are malfunctioning, octopuses are swarming, and your comb's missing... What should we do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I-Is this a silver spoon situation? I don't have one on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Noah! I guess this will do. Noah, take this—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Hold down! I'll keep myself calm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ssssss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>With my abdomen expanded...breathe out... Deep breathing... Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I'm good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Oh! Noah! You've got the deep breathing technique down perfectly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Whew, that's good! Now then, let's stay calm. We'll divide and conquer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Suzuka and Noah, head to the beach! Albea will be fixing the ship! And I'll stick around here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>This way there's no problems, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I see... This way everything's covered. Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Now then, I'm interested in what's going on in this cave. I'll just go take a look.</td>
</tr>
