<td>A small quantity of Alchemia was discovered in the sample of Giant Taurus flesh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It means that an even larger amount of Alchemia—think of it as a kind of energy—must be contained within its core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>As I have already explained, there are aspects of the Giant Taurus that greatly resemble the Ancient Dragon Bone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>A creature that as the name suggests, had armored scales that were as hard as bone. As a living being, it is very likely that the Giant Taurus too, has something like a core functioning in the center of its being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>When you say core, do you mean like a heart?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I suppose so. According to the legends of the Saga region, the Ancient Dragon Bone's core contained an incredible amount of Alchemia. Do you know what part of the Giant Taurus this flesh was taken from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Its foreleg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Considering the amount of Alchemia found in that sample, it is safe to assume that the beast's core would be reasonably far from its forelegs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I would prefer to avoid drawing conclusions from incomplete information. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I believe that destroying the Giant Taurus' core will mean its defeat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I see. In that case, we should do what we can to pinpoint its core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>From what I can tell, it could be in the middle of its stomach, or even towards the tip of its tail. Does that sound about right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes. We cannot rule out either possibility for the moment. We will need to investigate other parts of the beast—although that is no simple matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>True. If we can get a general idea of its location, and then blast it with everything we have... All right. Looks like we know what we need to focus on now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Leave the Giant Taurus to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's what we're here for. The Holy Guard, the Blue Flame Guard, and the Scarlet Flame Guard are a united front today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You can count on us. We're rearing to go! We won't let you down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I certainly hope not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>As for how we can destroy the core... We will be needing Judith's help for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Indeed. I believe that the strongest weapon we possess is her...Mecha Weapon, or what have you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Did you say Mecha Weapon?! You don't mean the forbidden weapon that was made to destroy the Giant Taurus, do you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I think you just answered your own question. Do you have a problem with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Of course I have a problem with it! As leader of the Holy Guard, I cannot allow that weapon to be used!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's a cursed thing! It shouldn't be used to uphold the justice of the continent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Shut the hell up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Tch. I thought I told you to stay quiet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>My dad made that to bring peace to Babel! It's not cursed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>My dad wished for this world to be at peace with all his heart, but you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You can't even do anything about the Giant Taurus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But you killed my dad anyway! And yet you stand there and insult his invention?! Who the hell do you think you are?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You disgust me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The Mecha Weapon drew its power from the Philosopher's Stone. That's why... Your father was... We had to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You've done your homework, huh? Good work, magnificent Lord Commander of the oh-so-righteous Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You don't understand! That kind of power is dangerous! It brings nothing but misfortune! I've seen it too many times! You don't want to go around messing with Philosopher's Stones, either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's why...it had to end like that. You have to make some sacrifices to serve the greater good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>How can you say that?! The Giant Taurus have taken countless lives! The entire continent is suffering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And what have you done to stop them? That's right, a whole lotta nothing! So who's the real one bringing misfortune, huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I will complete the Mecha Weapon without using a Philosopher's Stone! I will save this world myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And I will show you, all of you, that my dad did nothing wrong! He was wronged, and I will get justice for him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>He made the Mecha Weapon to bring peace to Babel! I won't let you insult it in front of me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I won't forgive you, or the so-called Holy Order, for trampling over his dream!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ngh! I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Give me back my dad! Give him back! You monster!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Judith... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I don't want to hurt a girl. Put your weapons down, man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ungh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I hate you! I despise the Holy Order! Get the hell out of my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'm gonna have to have you take a little nap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Wh-what?! What's going on over there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It's the Giant Taurus! Judith, let's finish this later! Knights, engage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yes, Lord Commander!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Tch. I have a bad feeling about this, but we can't just stand around doing nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>On it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I have to do it! I have to take down the Giant Taurus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Dangit. He knew we were out of gas, didn't he? Reiner, you ba—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Huh?! R-Reiner?! I've seen this Titan before...but that means...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Here they come! Bud, Victor! Get ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Tehre, you handle the evacuation! I don't want any more casualties!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Do not give me orders!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Here I go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Wait, Eren! Save your strength for the Giant Taurus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>This isn't an enemy that you can keep chipping away at until it falls down! We need to save our resources and hit it with everything we have all at once, as a last stand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Ngh... Fine. Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Judith, prepare yourself! Reiner is an enemy, all right?! Get that through your head!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>We can't fight properly without our ODM gear, so we're counting on your Mecha Weapon for this battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I... I just can't believe it. Reiner can't be a Titan. He can't be! I... I can't fight him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Tch! I guess I have no choice! I'll slice you open myself, Reiner!</td>
</tr>
