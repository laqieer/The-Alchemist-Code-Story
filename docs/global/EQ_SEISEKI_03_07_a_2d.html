<td>I'm so relieved that there was a clinic near the ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Thanks for telling us about it, Almira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The injury was bad enough that our emergency first aid equipment wouldn't have been enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's nothing. I'm glad I could help! At least I was able to play the role of a guide a little!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That being said, don't you think it's inefficient from a management perspective to build a clinic in an area like this with so few people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Who knows? All I know is that it's a standard clinic for the hunters and nomads passing through this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The fewer the better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The fewer patients I have the more I can concentrate on my research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Kagura! Can you stand already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Somehow I seem to be able to. Dr. Alexis really knows what he's doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Thank you, Dr. Alexis! I am really, really grateful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's nothing. An injury like this is no different than a scratch when using my medicine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Cough! Cough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Excuse me. Recently, my health hasn't been very good. It often happens that a doctor will neglect his or her own body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm going to take some medicine, so please excuse me for a moment. It will still take some time for her to completely heal, so how about you hang out here for a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>He's gone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>More importantly, what happened inside the ruins?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ri-right! We don't have time for this! We need to hurry back into the ruins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That man was chasing Kudan. He's extremely dangerous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Vice-Captain Monzein should be heading deeper into the ruins. Are you talking about Waginau? The man dressed in black...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No...that's not him. I think he's someone even stronger who wields a deadly power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>He was leading a large herd of monsters that attacked us. They took us by surprise and it was all we could do to defend ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>A large herd of monsters? Wait, could he have been behind the monsters that attacked us on the hill?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Who exactly are you talking about? Was it someone you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No, but Kudan seemed to know who he was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>He went chasing after him into the ruins with a just small band of knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No way. That's the same thing that happened last time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes. He might discard his own justice and become possessed with the desire for power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The stronger the opponent's power is the more danger there is of this happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh dear! We need to stop Captain Kudan before it's too late!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wait, what do you mean? Are you gonna stop Captain Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'll explain the details to you while we run! We need to rendezvous with Vice-Captain Monzein and head inside the ruins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Dr. Alexis...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Don't jump out suddenly like that! You scared me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Monsters...?! What are they doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh? You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What is going on?! Wait...are you working with them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Here they come! Get ready!</td>
