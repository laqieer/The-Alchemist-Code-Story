<td>My lord!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Stand down, Master Li Wang, or we answer with steel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>All right, all right. No need to get so serious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>With a snap of his fingers, Li Wang's men retreat without another word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Only a heated discussion, you understand. We merchants do get passionate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>My apologies for the misunderstanding. I shall take my leave now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But before that, may I strongly recommend giving my words some thought, Lord Zheng Yi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>After all, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. I'm sure we both want the best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Failing that, well... I'm sure you know what happens to those who dare threaten the peace and security of our great nation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I am sorry, my lord. Had I been more swift...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's not your fault. Are our guards safe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>None the worse for wear. I found them tied up and knocked out behind a shed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Is there no level he won't stoop to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You and I both know the other nobles will do little and less to aid our cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Not while Li Wang has most of them in his palm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I can only imagine the extent of his grasp in Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If only we knew more about him and Goetia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I've not heard from Shion in some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Troubling news indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It would behoove us to plan our moves accordingly from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I do not believe Li Wang will make too overt a move against us for the moment, but there is no telling how much worse he will do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Let us pray Shion makes it back safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Meanwhile, in the streets of Slothstein...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Spread out and flush them onto the streets! They couldn't have gotten far!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(They're everywhere...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(It's almost staggering to imagine the reach of Goetia's forces.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Shion approaches a concealed door, glancing furtively at her surroundings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Glad to have you back. Come on in.</td>
