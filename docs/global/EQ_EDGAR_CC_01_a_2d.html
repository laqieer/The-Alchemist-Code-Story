<td>Renegade A</td>
<td>On the first-floor corner room. He's sleeping beyond that window. There's no doubt about it, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Innkeeper</td>
<td>Yes. There's no doubt. I totally recognized that weird-shaped head. He's the rumored cleaner.</td>

<td>Renegade A</td>
<td>Edgar L. Leonhart...! Hey, you guys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Renegade A</td>
<td>Just to confirm. You don't mind if the bullets inadvertently end up hitting a different customer, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Innkeeper</td>
<td>Heheh. Well, I have received my reward and it's a prepaid lodging. What happens after that, whether a customer gets unfortunately involved in the crossfire...well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Renegade A</td>
<td>All right. Back down. Let's go, you guys. 3...2...1!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Renegade B</td>
<td>Heheh. This place is so disgusting it's hard to call it a room. The rumored cleaner seems to have met an unfortunate end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Renegade A</td>
<td>Don't let your guard down. Let's confirm the body first just in case.</td>

<tr>
<td>Renegade B</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>

<td>Renegade A</td>
<td>...!!! I-it's a bluff! With all three of us, one of us should at least have a shotâ€“</td>

<tr>
<td>Renegade B</td>
<td>Wh...whoaaa!!! I-I'm backing out of this! This guy totally knows already!!!</td>
