<td>The clashing of swords... The ringing of shields... The sounds of battle echo forth, far and wide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ghh. She's no joke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(She is incredibly strong. But she's not untouchable.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(Both her techniques and her form are outdated. It's like seeing a fossil in action.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yet no matter where I aim, whether it be the neck, elbows, knees, fingers, or even the eyes or the stomach, it doesn't seem to matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm confident that at least half of my hits connected, and I put my full strength behind them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And yet, they do nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This doesn't make any sense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Phew... Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Daphne, are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes... I can still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(She's reaching her limits. Of course she is! How many times has she taken those powerful blows? Her arms must be aching so!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Delightful! So, this is how people fight in this age, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>She really does seem to be thoroughly enjoying this. On the other hand, we're barely holding on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(If my sword doesn't have any effect, I guess I'll just have to use magil instead!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Prepare yourself, and think fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I couldn't completely dodge her attack, and so I had to meet it with my sword instead. I'm left barely able to hold my own. Just keeping her at bay is draining my stamina rapidly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(There's no outlasting an opponent like this. We have to end this quickly, or we have no hope of winning.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(But...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We also have no technique capable of attacking her. Or rather, no technique capable of successfully attacking her. Nothing we throw at her has any impact whatsoever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(My sword just isn't doing anything!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What should I do? What can I do? There's really only one option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I must overcome my own limits to win this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Haa... Phew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Your ability to defend against my attacks is faltering. How...disappointing. Is this all your future is worth to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Nnfgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Breathe in. Breathe out. Find your center. Put everything into this next strike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(Only one option...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Remember that feeling of bounding through time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(Only one way out: through that door I saw.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That place Nimul's voice beckoned me to. That place in the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>My Wrath is a righteous flame...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh? This ought to be interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I shall commit the full power of my Wrath into my blade!</td>
