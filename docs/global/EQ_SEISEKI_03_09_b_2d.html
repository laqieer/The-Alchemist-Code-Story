<td>Heheh. So you still can't find it within yourself to forgive me for the destruction of Wadatsumi and for burying that savior priestess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Watch it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>However, by removing such trivialities, you can now finally obtain true power! I will show you what true ambition is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Shut up! I will never ask for power from the likes of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I will hold steadfast to my justice! I will not let the reputation of the Holy Guard be tarnished by evil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Aghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hold steadfast to your justice? The reputation of the Holy Guard? What strange things to say!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Do you honestly believe that the Holy Guard is an order that pursues true justice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If so, you are an idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wh-what are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Fine. I will expose to you the truth behind that justice you bind yourself to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Nice to meet you. Or have we met before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My name is Waginau. I am one who preaches the teachings of the Holy Church of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The Holy Church? You speak lies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There is no way that one who disrupts the peace of the continent could swindle the Holy Church...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Heheh. Can you say that even after seeing this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What?! The emblem of the Holy Church?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>As you are well aware of, only those who serve within the inner circle of the Holy Church are allowed to wear the emblem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That means that only the Lord Commander, the leader of the 7 Regiments can have an audience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Lies! That's impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Heheh. If you don't believe me then you should ask someone. Maybe you could ask Lord Commander Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No...it can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Do you understand now? Even the Holy Order acknowledges me. They believe my ambitions are justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The appearance of conflict is nothing more than a triviality. All of it is for the sake of ambition. Power and justice are nothing more than part of the process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hehe...Yes. Think carefully about whether or not you want to maintain your own justice. In fact, think about whether that justice itself has any value at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What's the matter, Waginau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's nothing. A small matter came up so please tell me about the final conclusion once we get back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>All right. But the Gluttony soldiers may show up here eventually. We don't have time to be taking it easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I am aware of that.</td>
</tr>
