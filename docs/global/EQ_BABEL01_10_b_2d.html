<td>Ha! You've improved since the last time we did this, Victor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I know, right?! I feel like I'm finally catching up to you, Captain! I'll show you that I can even surpass you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Victor, who do you even think you're talking to? That's Captain Vettel, not some random guy on the street, holding a sword! He's just being nice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wanna try your sword against me? I promise that I won't be nice at all! I mean, it's okay if I murder you a little, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...Victor, don't. You saw how I could barely hold my own against him earlier, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yep! I saw that! I'll be just fine without trying it! Sorry! I will never overstep my bounds ever again! I will never say anything ever again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh no! Ah... I'm so sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Nina, you're so strong for someone your age! Your future holds a lot of promise...and your idea for the dress uniforms was wonderful, as well! I can't wait to see them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Thank you! I'll show you that I can be just as good as Sir Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So... I don't want to overstay my welcome. I'm gonna bounce. See ya, Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ren... Where will you go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Eh... I kinda got that Gerald guy on my mind. Kinda thought I'd go where he'd want me to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well... Now that you're integrating therians into the Scarlet Flame Guard, it gets me thinking... How might Wratharis react to this? What are they going to do next?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>All that typical info you can get by sneaking around and torturing people here and there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Don't worry, I'll be back to get my fill of fun from you all again. Bye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>He's gone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Gerald...had quite an impact on him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yeah... Who would've thought?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hm? What's that? Hey, Nina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh? Oh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The therians are...helping with the town's reconstruction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Even the village chief?! This is...amazing. The future that I dreamed of... It seems like it's coming into reach!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Let's go help as well. We'd better get started if we want to contribute enough to make up for Gerald's absence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Scarlet Flame Guard! Listen up! We hit a rough patch, but we must move forward. From here on out, we have a new mission! We will build a path for the humans and therians to live side-by-side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We will not forget our fallen comrade, Gerald! We shall honor his iron will and become the sun that protects the people of Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Here and now, we swear again! We will defend the setting Scarlet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We will hold in our hearts the Flames to manifest our iron will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We are the wielders of the Scarlet Flame!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We swear that our iron will shall stand indomitable in the face of hardship, in order to ensure the joy and laughter of the people!</td>
