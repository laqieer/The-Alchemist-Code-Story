<td>We finally made it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>To the harbor? I know a lot of imported goods from other lands come here, but what exactly are you planning this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>About that... Oh, there it is! That's what we need!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>So this what you were thinking when I said foundation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>After seeing your reactions to my piece the other day, I did some thinking and made a new arrangement. Please take a look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Here I was wondering what kind of bizarre flowers you'd bring this time, but it seems you've used conventional ones. But this vase is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes, I used one from a foreign land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>A vase from another land... I tried to recreate an image of Wadatsumi floating within a wide world. What do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So you've tried to part with tradition again by using a vase from another land. What are you trying to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Is this one unacceptable, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...There's something weirdly intriguing about it. It's as if the otherworldliness of the vase is accentuating the elegance of Wadatsumi's flowers... I like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The contrast is drawing out a different beauty from our flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>N-now that you mention it, this odd unfamiliarity has its own charm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Really?! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Phew. This one got a better reaction than my prior piece.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hozuki! I saw it! Those everyday Wadatsumi flowers really went well with that foreign vase. It was really cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Heheh, thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It'll take some time for them to understand the benefits of incorporating another land's culture in, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yeah... But your piece was the first, big step in getting your fellow students to accept it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Right. Our culture was cultivated little by little over a long time. That's why, just like with this piece...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If our people come to understand other cultures, our culture will also reach those other lands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>And then I'll be able to show people even more shinier, glorious things! Won't that be wonderful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>For now we'll just have to patiently build the foundation for that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I also realized I love Wadatsumi's culture more than anything else, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's why I have to value the feelings of those who love Wadatsumi's culture just as much I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hozuki, you seem a bit happier. Like some of the stress has left your shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Okay! I want to be as strong as you! I'm going to write another book that'll wow you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ugh, please stop mimicking me! It's so embarrassing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But I'm glad your interest in books has come back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It was thanks to you that I could figure out a path forward. If you hadn't given me advice, I wouldn't have been able to clear this hurdle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So let's continue to work hard and motivate each other as rivals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yes, let's do it!</td>
