<tr>
<td>Hozuki Classmate A</td>
<td>...There's something weirdly intriguing about it. It's as if the otherworldliness of the vase is accentuating the elegance of Wadatsumi's flowers... I like it.</td>

<td>Yeah... But your piece was the first, big step in getting your fellow students to accept it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/hozu.png" alt="Hozuki" height="128"><br>Hozuki</td>
<td>Right. Our culture was cultivated little by little over a long time. That's why, just like with this piece...</td>
