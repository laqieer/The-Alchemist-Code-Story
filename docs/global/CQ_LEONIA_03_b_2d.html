<td>Aaahh! Luce, get down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Careful, Leoniaz! Eyes up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Luce...! How much have you been training?! I can't believe how much you'veâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Do you really have time to be talking right now?! Keep your eyes on the enemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>One left!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I hope you've made your peace with the gods...for you're about to face them!</td>

<td>008</td>
<td>Leoniaz.</td>

<td>I realize that I am repeating myself, but know that I will neither lay down my sword, nor abandon my bridal training. I will yet become a fine chef.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ought I not to be skilled in as many areas as possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I am the queen of Envylia, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, when you put it that way... I can't very well hold back when you look at me with those big, determined eyes of yours, anyhow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'll be honest with you, Luce... I've regretted teaching you how to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You should have been living in peace in the castle, but my instruction has driven you onto the battlefield instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There is nothing for you to regret, Leoniaz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I am nothing but grateful to you for your tutelage. It is thanks to you that I stand capable of protecting this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Perhaps the result wasn't what you intended, but you have given me the foundation I need to be able to achieve what I desire as queen of this nation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Heheh. Seems like I didn't understand you as well as I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You might not be confined to a castle, but no one can say that you're not living as a queen should.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You've been prepared for this from the very beginning, while my heart yet wavered in indecision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Leoniaz...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Please, Your Highness. I know that it is presumptuous of me, but I want to devote my entire being to you, body and soul! I will be your Pure White Lion, guardian to the noble name of Queen Lucretia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh? Then, I'm counting on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I won't let you down, Luce.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Now that that has been taken care of, why don't we return to the castle so that I can get cooking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You go on ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Aren't you coming with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I have something to do first. I'm looking forward to trying what you make me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hmmm... Well, all right. Don't take too long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Aaaahh... I think I'm going to have to double my training to keep Luce from surpassing me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>However, I will not yield to any pressure! I swear that my lance will ensure that the path before her is clear as daylight, now and forever!</td>
