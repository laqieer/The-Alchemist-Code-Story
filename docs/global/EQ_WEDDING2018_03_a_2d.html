<td>Gah... What are you doing? Causing more problems?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I will think of a fitting punishment later. For the time being, you are not to leave your dormitory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>All right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No running!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I think I might have gone too far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Maybe just a tad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Moa, I know your heart is in the right place, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We can't just stop now! If it's for a successful wedding, I'll...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>About that... Why do you care so much about weddings?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well...it's just that...weddings bring true happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If that wasn't true, then I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Moa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We can't just sit around! We need to find the perfect venue for the bridal rehearsal! Come on, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh? Wait a second!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Moa truly is reckless, isn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry everyone... I swear she's a good kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>She just gets like this when it comes to weddings... Do you know why, Eve?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I don't know the whole reason, but it seems like something happened back home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I think that's why she wants to prove that marriage truly is a thing of happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So she continued to harbor those feelings even after she became a Phantom?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Moa, you're so caught up on this one idea of what happiness should be. I can't just ignore this because...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I was the same way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Uzuma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah... Looking at her, I just remembered how I used to be as well. I was so sad back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I wish for Moa to understand that there is more than one way to be happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I want to thank the both of you for thinking so much about Moa, even though she wrapped you up in all of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What can we do to help her, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We must be careful. If we do this half-heartedly, it may just end up upsetting her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yeah, she did seem like she was getting a bit antsy earlier. It'll probably be pretty hard to convince her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Heeey! Hurry up and get over here, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hmm... I wonder what happened this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hey, we found you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You're the lot that's been stirring up problems all around Lustburg, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Looks like we've gotta get rid of this group before we can get started.</td>
