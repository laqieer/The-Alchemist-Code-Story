<td>...! Huff...huff!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What's the matter, Logi? Are you not gonna attack?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I...I'd very much like to, but...you have no opening! How can you obtain so much power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I obtained my power only for myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Logi, you are going to obtain an even greater power than that which I could obtain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The power that you obtain to protect yourself will, ultimately, only protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Find people that share your aspirations and do whatever you can to protect them. That's how you must obtain your power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>All this time, I have blindly wielded my blade. I couldn't achieve that level of power, but you can, Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I can do something that you couldn't...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Those who surround themselves with friends and allies are always the ones with the power to choose justice. This choice is not born from a sword that ends lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Logi, first you encounter friends and allies whom you wish to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Find friends and allies and protect them? Do you think I can find them that easily? And can I succeed where I've failed before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>N-not good! The bandits are here again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ack. They're coming in droves! There's nothing left for them to steal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What?! Bandits have made it this far?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Se-Setsuna! Please wait. There's too many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Why? You're coming with me too, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh...um, yes! Of course, I will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I want to protect this village that let me stay all this time, but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Logi, you just asked me whether you could succeed where you've failed before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm not one to give you kind words of comfort and I doubt they would be of any help. Instead, let me just tell you this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You will never succeed unless you resolve yourself to making this happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>First of all, as practice, you can try by doing your best to protect me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Let's go. Those who aim to take have no empathy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's not just Setsuna. I need to protect all those who are dear to me!</td>
