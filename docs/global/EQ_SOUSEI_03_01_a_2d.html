<td>Where am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I can't see anything. What is this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What was the point of such relentless suffering?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Emmel? Are you there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Who are you talking to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What's this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The road you have chosen is an untrodden wasteland.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>To disavow sin, to punish it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>How do I...know this? That's right, I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Understand this well. This is what it means to relinquish your sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Relinquish...sin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>W-wait! That gate! That's the gate I've been...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>—mul, Nimul! How long do you plan to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ah, you're finally up...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Adaleigh? I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're the one who offered to help! Then you just doze off like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Day in and day out, I've been navigating this airship. I could use some sleep too, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ugh, well, I'm used to that, but I would have at least enjoyed having someone to talk to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What's wrong? You don't look so good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Lately, my sleep has been quite poor. I've had horrible dreams every night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You're tired. Go to your room and rest like everyone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No, I'm fine now! I'm completely refreshed already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>So, this Acedia Belt Region we're headed to... What kind of place is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Curious? Well, I can tell you a little bit about it, or...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You could see it with your own eyes! We'll be crossing the barrier soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This is the Acedia Belt Region, the domain of the Cursed Beast Belphegor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And the place I was born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I can see some mines here and there. What's that floating island over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That would be our destination. It's the largest research complex in this region, the floating city of Redington.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That floating piece of land is a city? What's that tower in the center?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh, that? Uh, don't worry about it for now. Everything will be explained in due time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I see... What a sight! A city that floats in the sky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Isn't it? This is the power of our magic! But we didn't put our cities in the sky for no reason, you know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ah, right. If I remember correctly, this region—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Let's save the details for later! I'm bringing the airship alongside!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's going to be a little rough going in. Can you go tell everyone to brace themselves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Alright, docking complete! Perfect, just as expected!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This is a city of the Acedia Belt Region, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Incredible! The city's really floating! And there are so many airships! They're mostly smaller than ours, but there are scores of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I had already known from seeing Adaleigh's airship, but this is truly a region on the cutting edge of technology!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>A place of such development... It really puts Sephira Village to shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Everybody I see is carrying some kind of machine. It shows how deeply technology has permeated this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Those machines enhanced with magic are characteristic of what we research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Our research is focused on developing the technology to control magil in-line with the principles of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It requires some very specialized tools to maintain, so it is less adaptable compared to your Spiritbonding or the magic of the Luxuria Belt Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But any individual can use it, regardless of what strengths or weaknesses they might have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Basically, its advantages are that it's reliable and anyone can use it as long as someone understands the system, so—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Adaleigh, you really love to prattle on about your favorite topics, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Come on, Mira. Let him go on. Experts like him need to get a sense of satisfaction from listening to themselves talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You both know that you don't always have to speak what's on your mind, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Anyway, I'll be happy to have a place for us to settle down for a while. Will the airship's repairs take a great deal of time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yeah. A complete overhaul will take at least a week.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Many of the specially ordered parts are busted, so we need to start by getting those.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That being said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>So that airship we were talking about has returned? What does that have to do with anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>But really, to bring in people from another region...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Are they seriously planning to do something to the Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That isn't any concern of ours. We have no time to spare on this matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>There's just not enough time. In order to keep everything on schedule, we must complete our current research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Despite all the attention we're getting, not one of them seems to be interested in speaking to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Adaleigh, do people here...not like you? Are you all right? You do have friends in this region, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>It's none of your business!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>The people of this city are just like this. Everyone has their hands full with their own research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>So they're all so absorbed in their own world that they can't be bothered by anything outside of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hmm, this attitude sounds familiar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Don't look at me like that. There's absolutely no way I'm as bad as they are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Your silence is hurtful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>In any case, pretty much everyone here is like this, so try not to mind it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hah! I knew I recognized the sound of that motor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What's with this wear and tear, Adaleigh? How much time are you gonna spend running around in corrupted regions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Oh no... I know that voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Hey, you could at least pretend to be happy to see me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I came all the way out here to greet you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>What a touching reunion, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Why are you just standing there with your arms wide open?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Statistically speaking, this kind of reunion should result in a big hug and joy and that kind of thing... Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>No way! Why are you trying to embarrass me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>That's adolescence for ya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Adaleigh, who might this be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>This is Icona. How should I put this... She's my senior, er...fellow researcher?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I'm delighted to meet your friends! For the first time! I've never been so proud. Brings a tear to my eye... My little boy's growing up...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>My name is Icona. I'm the Chief Engineer here in Redington.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Chief...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>That means I'm the head honcho of engineers here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Even the mayor listens to what I say. You could say I'm something of a VIP around here, a member of an elite, privileged class of people, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>You're not supposed to brag like that. You're embarrassing me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>There's nothing wrong with a little bragging! The people in this region don't care about anything but their own affairs. It's terribly dull.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>If don't do this, no one would know to appreciate my excellent achievements!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Right. No one here seems interested in the people around them. Well, except you, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Isn't it sad? Technology would progress by leaps and bounds if only we could manage to cooperate better with each other around here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>If you isolate yourself completely, then you're bound to make a ton of errors and get stuck in uncertainty without any way out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>...Icona, you don't think much before you open that mouth of yours, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Ahaha! Well, I did actually have a reason for coming here. Your airship needs repairs, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Yeah. The environment of other regions is more than I imagined, and our specs aren't as good as I'd like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Gotcha, gotcha! Still looking for the Sephira, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Finding a way to deal with the Cursed Beasts isn't going to be easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>With a quest like this, you'll fail time and time again. But then you can—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Actually... I've found them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Apologies. We haven't introduced ourselves yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>My name is Nimul, and I come to this region to save it from the threat of the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>...Give me all the details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I see. So you're saying...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>So Nimmy and Waggy here, plus Emmy too, are all people of Sephira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Emmy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>And you guys came all the way here to the Acedia Belt Region right after beating down Asmodeus, the Cursed Beast of the Luxuria Belt Region?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Put that way, it does sounds pretty unbelievable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Even I can barely believe we really did all that, and got ourselves all the way here to boot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>So the Sephira are capable of subduing corruption and Anti-Curse magic, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>That's a pretty selfish way of going about things...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Icona?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Nah, it's nothing. So this is to say that you guys think you know how to deal with the Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Yes. We plan to release all people from the threat of the Cursed Beasts. In fact, we consider that our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>I know this might be difficult to believe, but we would be honored to have your cooperation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Nah, I believe you. I'm not so distrustful as to doubt my own brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Uhm, you two are related?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>We're not blood-related. We were both orphans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Icona...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>It's fine, Adaleigh. It's not like it's a rare thing in this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>So, have you guys already worked out how to defeat the Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>No. We were able to defeat the Cursed Beast of Luxuria, but we cannot expect the same method will work every time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>So first, we'd like any information regarding the Cursed Beast of this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>If that's the case, I do think I can help you out. I was planning to go down to the surface for an inspection of the mines sometime soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>I can share whatever info I gather there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>There's rumors of illegal mining that I need to check out, though that's not really an engineer's job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Mining on the surface? So your cities are floating above ground, but people live on the surface too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Ah, it's time to explain things for our guests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>You'll need every advantage you can get, and to do that it's vital you know what kind of nightmare you're dealing with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>The floating city of Redington was built to avoid earthquakes caused by the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Earth...quakes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Simply put, it's a shaking of the earth. The ground shakes so violently that everything on the surface is reduced to rubble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>That's right. The land of this region was reduced to a wasteland.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>It's all thanks to the earthquakes caused by that Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>So you built your homes in the air to avoid the shaking on the surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>The technology required to make something like this... It's truly remarkable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Though unfortunately, the city isn't large enough to house all the people of this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>And it takes fuel to keep the city airborne, the same as an airship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Something the size of an airship can make due with magil from the air alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>But for something this big...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>So you mine for fuel on the surface?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Exactly! This region is composed of the elites living in the sky and the laborers living on the surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>To be honest, there are far more people living on the surface than in the air.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>All commodities and necessary resources are made in factories in the floating cities, then distributed to the population below.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Only after collecting a ton of tariffs from them, though. It's the peak of ineffectiveness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>If we were to defeat the Cursed Beast, the circumstances here would change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>If you believe that going down to the surface would be helpful to our cause, then... The Cursed Beast is on the surface?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Not quite. According to the legends, the Cursed Beast lives underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Legends? You're saying that no one has ever seen it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>I'm sorry to say it, but there is no record of anyone laying eyes on it for centuries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Still, the earthquakes are real and there are many tales of corruption swallowing miners in the mine shafts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>At the very least, there is no denying that there is something underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>That means that we should start by locating the Cursed Beast. When will your inspection of the surface begin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Well, it could be right around the corner, but I haven't been told that it's an urgent matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>I mean, the fact that they have a technician taking care of this inspection instead of the Special Detectives, Redington's so-called "hunting dogs," shows that they're not too pressed about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>I suppose they just want to be able to say on paper that they did indeed take a look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Special Detectives...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>What's wrong, Adaleigh? You don't look so good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>No, it's... It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>A long time ago, Adaleigh was tied up in allegations of embezzling research funds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Wow, you were a real bad boy, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>It wasn't me! They targeted me because I was an orphan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>I didn't know you've led such a difficult life, Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>In any case, the first thing to do is to get ourselves situated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>It's possible that we might encounter the Cursed Beast, so it would be wise to make sure we're in the best condition to handle it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>That's right. We've been cooped up in the airship for too long with barely any physical activity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>I'd like to try and get back into shape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Aha! Exercise! So you'd like get moving?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>I was just griping over how there's not enough combat data for the new Engineer Soldier models.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>I'd be incredibly grateful if you could help me collect some data with a practice battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>That woman is a vital ally. Got it, Waginau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>It doesn't matter if you agree or not, okay? All right, let's move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Very well. We'll show these tin men what we can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>W-what? Me too? Me too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Well, it's not a bad chance for me to test this out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Target acquired! Target acquired! Confirmation of enemy units. Commencing with elimination.</td>
</tr>
