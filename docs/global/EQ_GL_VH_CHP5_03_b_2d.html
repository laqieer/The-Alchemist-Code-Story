<td>Ugh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(My arm...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I got you now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Gwaagh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That was close. You all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I suppose this makes us even, does it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're in pretty bad shape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Too much has happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Is the Professor in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yeah. Everyone is. I'll take you to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?! Zheng Yi's entire house has been arrested?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Damn Goetia and their lackeys! Are they satisfied only with blood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>They were imprisoned, from what little information I could glean from a few drunken guards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>As for my lord and my sister... I do not know where they have been taken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Knowing Li Wang, he will not hesitate to torture them if need be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What about the Core? If they get it up and running...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Rest assured my lord prepared for the possibility that such information might fall into the hands of his enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It will not be such a simple matter for them to reactivate the Core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's a silver lining, at least...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(First Roxanne, and now Zheng Yi... No, this can't go on.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Soren and the rest can keep running, but I won't.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(Not when Roxanne is still...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Siegfried?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's good to see you again, Shion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But there are things I want to look into. It's better that I go at it alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The others need you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'll be there. I promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...Very well. Take care, Siegfried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Shion watches as Siegfried's retreating form blends with the snow-touched trees in the distance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I hope you understand the path you walk, my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I must confess, I didn't quite imagine coming back to such a turn of events.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But after what happened in Greed Dike and Goetia's increasing aggression, I do not find myself surprised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Looks like Goetia will stop at nothing to restart the Construct project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If we can't stop them, we can at least try to beat them to the punch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You mentioned Zheng Yi had failsafe measures for the defunct Core?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yes. It was to ensure that if anyone ever got a hold of the Core, there would still be a backup measure to prevent it from functioning as intended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It was partly a stroke of luck he chose to implement such a system, and partly the genius of the design.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You must have thought of it as well, Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's one thing to be grateful for, I suppose...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I can confirm that, Master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You were never one to leave things to chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What else do you know about Atropos?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Mm... Well, she was created to lead the Constructs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>So she looked really different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Right...those golem-looking things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Pardon me, but I cannot help but notice how...human you are. Forgive my lack of a better word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Master intended it! And it helps me put people at ease!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Fufu... That is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Considering Goetia's immense power, it won't be long before they make something of this Core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Eira...help Big Bro! And La...Laky...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Um...Lucky Sis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ahaha! I like that name!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ehehe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Well, then I believe we should chart our course of action sooner rather than later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Time is of the essence, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But before that... Has anyone seen Siegfried?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ah. Yes, about that...</td>
</tr>
