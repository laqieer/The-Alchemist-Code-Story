<td>"Nihil", was it? As in nihilism? You really are a show-off, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Tch! So what if I am?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Your magic is as unoriginal as your martial skills. You've made no progress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I will soon enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Build your strength with those who understand the foolishness of it. Learn that imitation is the secret to surpassing the authentic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>These are all things you will share with your comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The more the merrier, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Make sure to run away after losing, villain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Damn...it...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'll be waiting for you higher up. I'll count to ten for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You will fall, but I expect you to climb back up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Pretty cool, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Cool...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Seeing your will become a path for someone to follow. The possibility of undoing this dark world of death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Are you scared of losing your humanity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You did not turn like the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I do prefer to be a pioneer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Those who are to climb Veda, those who desire strength... They are following after you, are they not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So you will be one who takes my dark power and stands by me to draw the world to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We can learn what it all means together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We'll essentially be roommates. Don't be surprised. Would you prefer me to be a weak-willed inhuman?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I will be your vanguard, and you will help Lost Blue. Let's get to know the world together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why would you... You're going to shoulder all the hate and jealousy to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>—move on. So we can all move forwards. I can, they can, and so can you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Naive! You two are oh so naive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Looks like you got a visitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Your naivete is making me sick to my stomach! Like eating pudding slathered in melted marshmallow and honey...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Don't you agree, Nero?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Did she just appear from a tear in reality?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I am Lil' Ouroboros!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I am the Continental Observer, the one who peers into the abyss. Nero, not unlike you, I am one who is altered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You...know who I am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh, not at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I simply have a feeling that you are as I said, but there is something irregular with your existence along with this Tower Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I haven't an exact answer on this matter. It is your charge to find that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What is the esteemed Observer doing here in some, as you say, irregular Tower, then? Just here to make small talk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I was watching from my plane. I saw those with power going in and out of the Tower Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I have never seen such flow of power. The Tower Veda's pulse quickened... I couldn't help myself. I had to come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Not to mention, I just couldn't bear listening to your naive chatter any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You must've been bored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>So bored!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>O-oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Nero, if you wish to know yourself and the world, you needn't follow the plans of this self-important fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>That's rude. I mean, you're not wrong, but still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Vanir, the fate of your friends is none of our concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I assumed as much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You want to measure your strength by giving it to another and seeing their progress? How tedious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>But...Vanir said if one who I gave my power to changes the world, then I can understand the meaning behind this power of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What's the point of giving an ant a lollipop to watch it take it to its nest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>That analogy is confusing and roundabout.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If destruction is to be the end result anyway, why leave it up to the imperfect and limited humans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Surely we would be a better option than humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You mean I could find out the purpose of my power myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Heheheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>If I destroy this world with my own hands...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Then I can learn of this world without anybody's help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Exactly! What better way to understand humans and the power of their indomitable will?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Don't you think that would be a more entertaining idea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Heheh... Hahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Vanir. Am I mistaken?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I'm humbled. I never expected to hear such extreme logic come from purely innocent curiosity with no hint of malice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I'll take that as a compliment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Vanir, would my destruction of the humans be undesirable to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>That sounds as arrogant as a dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Regardless, Vanir wouldn't be able to do anything about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Is...that true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Vanir has paid what he owes you. But yet you hesitate to give power to Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Even though that was his price for staying with you eternally. Perhaps you do not trust him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Though it seems Vanir is not about to raise an objection over this matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Well, it was my idea to begin with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I-I don't mean to...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I don't mind. It keeps me from straying too far ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Well then, let us go slaughter the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Lil', have you ever had a parfait?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Okay, wow, you're quite familiar all of a sudden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>What would you hate to see on a parfait?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Honestly? I cannot tolerate dried fruit and bland granola placed only to fill space. Unforgivable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Putting your spoon to something like that is just depressing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Exactly! Still, I adore the moment you put your spoon to a parfait to consume it, shattering the perfected harmony of brilliance and color. Now that is pleasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Even the time spent waiting for the parfait to be built is pleasurable, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I might even go as far to say your confrontation against the parfait begins at the moment you see its picture. You wonder where to strike first, what to taste in what order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Then would you mind waiting until it is complete?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Vanir...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>A parfait?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Yes, of a kind... The delicacy called Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>That is a horrible name for a parfait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>It's not a parfait. Though I will admit, it does sound a bit tacky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I thought we were talking about parfaits! And that name is so tacky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Even if they are thoroughly defeated, a true villain will escape only to come back and fight another day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>That boy... Nihil, was it? You want us to give him and Lost Blue time to grow first?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I will lend my eye and effort to the ingredients and Nero will flavor them through guidance; and then we will together shatter them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Sounds quite worth your while, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Like I said earlier... So naive...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>The destruction of the world can wait until we see this through, can't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Nero, I understand your disappointment towards humans, but just this one last time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Can you give Lost Blue a chance? Will you share your strength?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Vanir...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Who doesn't love an underdog story?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Maybe...I'll speak to them a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Speak to them, listen to their will, and just when their naive dreams are coming to fruition...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Let us slaughter them. Along with the dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I'll need to keep things simple. Ten members in the group should be enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>We'll take on dirty jobs while we train. We'll take the Sacred Stones for ourselves to turn this world on its head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>We'll engrave and carry commandments on our backs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>We'll be the Veda Templars!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I will lead them, and I will bring the sky to this world. I will drag the weak-willed, apathetic scum into the light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>My name, then...is Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Sol?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I will be the sun that Lost Blue needs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I can't afford to be nihilistic anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I must gather my ten to vanquish the dragon of Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Vanir...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>You will be the Templars' first enemy.</td>
</tr>
