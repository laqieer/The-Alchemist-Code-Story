</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Well done. You defended it until the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How much will it be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Please, you saved my life! The least I could do is give it to you! I won't take any money for it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I will...excuse myself now! Thank you, truly, for everything!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Heh. A piece of poetry created by a true master, huh? This far out-values the life of that merchant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well then...now that I've managed to safely procure the squirrel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...?</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Lord Zahar? What is the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What the...? The squirrel's tail...there's a crack in it!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This crack wasn't present when I viewed it at the marketplace! That merchant! He hardly protected it at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Those blasted bandits! Tsk! Such a thing like this...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh! The tail...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I have no need for something that is flawed!</td>

<td>017</td>
<td>...Honestly. What a waste of time!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(Yes...of course...a day will come...when I'll no longer be able to remain by his side.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(When Lord Zahar obtains a power so great...that he will no longer need my inferior strength... When that day comes...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(I...won't be needed any more...like this squirrel.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Lord Zahar, this squirrel figurine...may I keep it for myself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's rare for you to express such a desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You're aware that it's blemished, right? Are you fine with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes. I wish to have it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Fine. Do as you like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Thank...you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Heh. You're a strange one to want something that is broken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Um...Lord Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
