<td>And so we ran and ran, dodging demons and townsfolk alike. From this time forth, there was never a moment of rest for either of us; we were forever pursued.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Who knows how many demons we may have felled along the way? Yet even as Sumeragi's sword became slicked with blood, the onslaught just kept coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>And that's not even to mention the townsfolk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hey! It's those demon spawn! I hear they ran away from the castle! If we let them go, they'll probably kill us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Then we'd better kill 'em first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We were outnumbered on all fronts. After just a short while, our bodies were mottled with wounds. We were hated—scorned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yet our resolve never buckled, even when we were hounded to the very edge of our physical limitations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huff...huff... Wha—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Mikaboshi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sumeragi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So, this is it, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What are you saying?! You can't give up now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Or was that oath you made to me that day nothing more than a lie?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Of course...it wasn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Then prove it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The future that Mother and Father envisioned...will be realized. I know it. I can feel it. Lady Mitsuha...has the same vision, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Even if I die...I know...someday...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No... Nooooo! You can't die! I won't let you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Don't worry. I'm...not about to be killed by demons. I have an oath to uphold...after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>By my own will, I shall make this body into a sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Sumeragi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The sword will drink up my blood, and the fierce resolve of man that I inherited from Father will be embedded deep within its blade...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...along with Mother's tenacity to stand against the malice of the present-day demons, and against the very demon Malice itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>With Mother's demonic aspect incorporated into it, the more demon blood it absorbs, the stronger it will become.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It will drink and drink and drink its fill of demon blood. And then one day, when it is engorged to the point of bursting, the blade itself will become a demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>My father's will, and my mother's will, and my own will... All will be placed in the hands of future generations...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...and all you demons who kill, devour, and overtake will be hewn asunder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I offer up this body now, that it may become a Demon-Splitting Blade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Even without magnificent horns like yours, Mikaboshi...I'm still your other half. So I wonder if I'll wind up taking on a form worthy of you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Sumeragi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This is goodbye. Until we meet...again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I didn't even have a chance to call out to him again. It was clear that he'd breathed his last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I didn't know what to say. And before any words passed my lips at all, the demons swarmed onto Sumeragi's remains.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Sume...ragi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>He... He was being devoured. I almost couldn't process that it was happening. I could barely process anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Why does it have to be this way? I just stood there, silently asking myself, why must I lose even his remains?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>All I wanted was to live out my life with another person—with a partner in crime, so to speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>"Even in death," we vowed. But that part of our oath was just lip service, as far as I'd been concerned. I wanted us to live together, and fulfill our oath together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>My beloved other half...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Why did you have to be taken away from me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>This is all wrong, I thought! It shouldn't be this way! It's just... It's too sad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Even if it were too late, I had to fight back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Don't touch him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I want to save all those who are dear to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>We swore we'd see this through, even in death. And I'm not just going to stand by and let you eat away at the hopes you've so callously torn down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Sumeragi's body...and the will he's left behind within it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I won't let them be taken away, too!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Beast Art Evocations! Book Two, Tigris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Grrraaaaaarrgh!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I won't be killed by some heartless demon. I... I despise demons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Demons must be eradicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>There can be no recompense for what you've done to this land... For what you've done to its people... For what you've done to Sumeragi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You've taken everything from me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Demons? Hardly. You are malice incarnate. A malice called Demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You took my father...my mother...my brother...my life...our future...our resolve...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...No, wait. You haven't gotten those last two yet. And I won't let you. I won't ever allow you to take away the future we've envisioned, or our resolve to see it through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>With this eye, I shall bear witness to every heinous thing you do. I will behold your actions, and judge them accordingly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Even if it costs me my life...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I shall not falter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>This eye will root out all demons born of malice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Even if I can't fell them with my own hand, I will reveal them for what they are. And to ensure you can take nothing further from me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...this eye will drink up my blood and carry on my memory...so that even when the flow of time has weathered it into a stone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...you'll know well that my will—my resolve—has not and will never be faded!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
