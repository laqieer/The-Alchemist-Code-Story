<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wh-what's going on, man?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Guess you won't be lowering that sword of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Of course not. Why would I when I have no idea whether you're friend or foe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'll ask you again; who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Very well. Allow me to answer. We are travelers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We appear to have lost our way. We are unaware of our current whereabouts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What country are you from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Country...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You can't even tell me where you're from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...We're from the Kingdom of Lucis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...Lucis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Judging by the look on your face, you've never heard of it before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Now would you kindly answer our question: where are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This is Northern Pride. We're just on the border of Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Where the heck is that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So, you really do know nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Those names are unfamiliar to our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Let me ask you another thing: do you know who those soldiers were?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That would be the Imperial Army's Magitek Axemen. They're pursuing us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So, you know their names...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Are the appearance of those soldiers and monsters somehow related to these individuals?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Um...couldn't you put away that sword of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Fine. I'll believe your story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm Dias. And you are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...My name is Ignis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, um, you can call me Prompto.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...I'm Noctis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The name's Gladiolus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So what're we gonna do from now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well, obviously we've got to find a way to get back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>A way to get back? I came here on a mission to investigate the mysterious soldiers and monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If you know their identity, that makes my job a lot more convenient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Most likely, their appearance is connected to yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Indeed. It appears the Magitek Axemen are somehow relevant to our situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If we can get you back, most likely they'll be gone from here as well. Would you accompany me in my investigation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That appears to be a convenient solution for us as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Enough talk. Looks like they're back.</td>
