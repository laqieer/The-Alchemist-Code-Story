<td>Did it work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Kamui! It worked! We were so in sync!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yeah, somehow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(But it certainly wasn't easy. To think that my duty as a Sephira to purify corruption could be so difficult...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It seems that I still have much to learn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Heheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Malta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What do you think? If you ever have any trouble again, just remember that you've got me to help you like I did today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No, that won't happen. I'm going to get strong, strong enough to protect everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Kamui... You don't have to shoulder everything on your own, you knowâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Malta!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Kamui!</td>

<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's...Hisham and Isidore? Why are they...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I was so worried, so I snuck out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hehe. If father finds out, he's going to be so mad at both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Uh, if you could get him to let us off the hook...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, what do you think we should do, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>K-Kamui?! I'm sorry I couldn't just sit quietly and wait at home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I was just super worried about both of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I beg you, Kamui! Please help an old pal out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hmmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Let's discuss this when we get back to the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(That's right, I'm going to get stronger. I have to.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(That's the only way to protect the happy, peaceful life I have with my friends and family.)</td>
