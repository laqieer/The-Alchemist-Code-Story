<td>What were you thinking, Creto? Letting that assassin walk free...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It never hurts to spare a life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'll tell you what really hurts: a dagger in the bloody back! I won't be able to sleep tonight, not while knowing someone out there wants me dead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's necesary to live and let live, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>How can you say that?! What good is mercy at a time like this? None, I tell you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'll find myself another bodyguard, but I won't be calling upon the Sosenko's services ever again! You can count on that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>W-wait! Perhaps we can...! And there he goes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh dear. I suppose this means I've lost another job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This is no good. Our disciples grow fewer by the day. I must do what I can to gather sufficient funds, or else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yet killing that assassin would have meant betraying everything I stand for...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The sword need not be an instrument of death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It can be a tool to save lives or spare them. That is the way of the Sosenko: our swords must never become assassin blades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We of the Sosenko are proud of that fact, and must believe that it is what guides us to cast light upon this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You're leaving? Your family has been with us for generations...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I am sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I admire the Sosenko's ideology, I do, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I can't be like you, Creto.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I cannot bring myself to ignore the fact that I could use my strength to avenge my friend. I can't just...suppress that desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Do you know what everyone calls you behind your back, Creto?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>A coward. A weakling who can't bring himself to kill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>A blade that doesn't kill can't save anyone either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>A blade that doesn't kill can't save anyone either... Gah! I'll never forget those words, but...simply dwelling on them isn't going to solve anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I still have one other job today. I've got to pull myself together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I-I'm so...hungry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This isn't going to work. A few small dumplings aren't enough to get me through the day. If anything, they just made me hungrier. I'm starving...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I suppose I should have carried out that job earlier, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No... No, I shouldn't have. I did the right thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The way of the Sosenko is mine to keep. I must never bring it dishonor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If only I wasn't so very hungry, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I can't handle this life of poverty. I'm not like you, Creto.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I understand. Of course I do. It's only natural to get fed up with this miserable lifestyle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>All righty, here we are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The legendary flavor brought to you by a business that's been going for a century. A big bowl of our special sweet bean dessert, topped generously with homemade brown sugar syrup made according to our secret recipe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Mm... Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Do you need something? You've been fixing that harsh glare of yours on me for some time now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wh-what?! I... No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>M-my apologies. I meant no offense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Then what the hell is your problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You want some?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>N-no, not...exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ahah...hahaha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Jeez. Hey, miss? Can I get another one of these? Give it to this man here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Certainly! Another big bowl of our special sweet bean dessert, topped generously with our homemade brown sugar syrup, coming right up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>A-are you sure?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I can't really enjoy this while you're looking at me like that, so yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Wow...umgf...this is so good! So sweet, but with that hint of salt and spice. I can feel it seeping into my very being!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>And this syrup! It's so thick and rich, without being too much... It's absolute perfection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What the hell do you normally eat? Straw?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I'm not sure... I think lately I've been eating mostly just rice, soaking it in hot water to bulk it up a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It was getting a bit much, even for me, so I've been taking on some jobs as a bodyguard, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>But?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Well... If they turn out to be jobs that require me to kill somebody, I end up turning them down. So I'm stuck being stone broke...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>And so hungry I could eat a horse. Or two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Why do you turn them down? Looks to me like you're hungry enough to stomach spilling a bit of blood, even if it makes you squeamish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I will not kill people for money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Well...I do not want to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Alas, as you can see, I might not have a choice. My disciples cannot handle this life of poverty, and it's only a matter of time before I become too desperate and flee from it as well, just as they have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What's...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You're Reimei, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>So what if I am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Aaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>You're dead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Drawing your sword in a place like this... Are you out of your mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You a friend of Reimei's? Then you'll meet the same fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>There's no need for you to interfere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I owe you for that delicious meal. I will aid you in this fight!</td>
</tr>
