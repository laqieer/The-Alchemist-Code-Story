</tr>
<tr>

<td>But, how did I protect her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>No memory, huh? Best not to concern yourself with that right now. Let's just be grateful everybody's okay.</td>

<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>Yup!</td>

<td>Claybelle...</td>

<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>This is where we part ways. Staying any longer would only cause more trouble for everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>I understand. Seeing what they're willing to do, it would be unwise indeed for you to stay in one place any longer than you have to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>But where will you go next? Don't tell me you're already plotting to raid Ophioneus' stronghold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I thought I'd head toward the Envy Layer—to Melvillei's domain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Ah, the credulously good-natured Melvillei. It's a good thought. Ophioneus' forces aren't likely to set their sights there too soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>I can write you a formal letter of introduction, to ensure your safe pass—</td>

<td>Ack! Gah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>I'm just glad it accomplished its mission. I would've hated to see the death of a like-minded dragon amount to nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/shah.png" alt="Shahel" height="128"><br>Shahel</td>
<td>We are a sort of a colony of beings, so ordinarily my death would be meaningless. But in actuality, when one of us dies, it causes such an irritating noise for the others! So I must respectfully retreat. You understand.</td>

<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Agh! Th-this magil...!</td>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Get back! Don't touch me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Don't mind...me! Take my disciples, and...run! Ghhhah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>I see. This confirms it. The illness born in this Stratum...comes from sin. Be it mine, or the humans'... Any sin, from any source...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>It's our fault. Our failures have brought this about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Claybelle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Do not...try to save me. Touch me, and you too...will be corrupted.</td>

<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>(This magil emanating from Claybelle... I can only imagine the effect it might have on humans and dragons alike...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Lil, take that girl with you and run into town. You must warn the people there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>But what about you, Zafeiris?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I will...try to stop her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>L-let me help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but I cannot fight her and protect you at the same time. Claybelle is one of the seven great dragons. She is a dragon who still preserves her primordial form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>But you can trust me. You know I'll do everything I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>O-okay... But you have to promise you'll come back to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Claybelle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Fool. I told you to...run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I can't just leave you like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>There is no way to save me now. This illness infects not the body, but the soul. My magil is contaminated...corrupted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Still!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I can't abandon a friend. I won't! Not again. Not anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Hmph... Haha. A friend, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>Then you know what you have to do. Don't hesitate. Kill me. I don't want to harm my disciples, nor any of the other humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>That is the greatest mercy you can give me right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle?</td>
<td>Ooooooghh!</td>
