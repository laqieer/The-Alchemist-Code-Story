<td>All operations completed. Enclosure of the consolidated territory confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The lid had been tightened upon the end days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Allocating all resources to environmental conservation. Activating Ring of Ouroboros. Severing all access to outer world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wait! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>All routes blockaded. All destinies anchored. Activating bypass of destruction through continued circulation of present time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Future survival of dragon species...confirmed feasible. Preservation of species is possible through the continuation of current operations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Isolate the cycle. Devour my tail to transmigrate. Ouroboros ensures a tomorrow much like yesterday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wha— How?! Ouroboros?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That voice... It's the same as back then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...So, she's connected with the Shell to ensure her survival. It seems contact with Ouroboros as Schmeier envisioned may occur sooner than expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Why the long face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Zafeiris? Ah, Sia! You have to help her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Don't worry. She's all right. Thank you for protecting her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, good! That's a relief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But, how did I protect her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No memory, huh? Best not to concern yourself with that right now. Let's just be grateful everybody's okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Can you stand, Lil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Claybelle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This is where we part ways. Staying any longer would only cause more trouble for everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I understand. Seeing what they're willing to do, it would be unwise indeed for you to stay in one place any longer than you have to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But where will you go next? Don't tell me you're already plotting to raid Ophioneus' stronghold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I thought I'd head toward the Envy Layer—to Melvillei's domain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ah, the credulously good-natured Melvillei. It's a good thought. Ophioneus' forces aren't likely to set their sights there too soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I can write you a formal letter of introduction, to ensure your safe pass—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm afraid that won't be necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Urgh! What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>A high elf... One of Ophioneus', I presume! What did you just do to me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ack! Gah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh, my. Number 73 was quite a stout specimen. Who would've imagined it would go down in one hit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm just glad it accomplished its mission. I would've hated to see the death of a like-minded dragon amount to nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>My apologies. I understand you must be furious, but I cannot permit you to take out your rage upon me right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We are a sort of a colony of beings, so ordinarily my death would be meaningless. But in actuality, when one of us dies, it causes such an irritating noise for the others! So I must respectfully retreat. You understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Agh! Th-this magil...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Claybelle! Allow me to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Get back! Don't touch me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Don't mind...me! Take my disciples, and...run! Ghhhah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I see. This confirms it. The illness born in this Stratum...comes from sin. Be it mine, or the humans'... Any sin, from any source...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It's our fault. Our failures have brought this about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Claybelle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Do not...try to save me. Touch me, and you too...will be corrupted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huh? Wh-what's happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Ah... I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(This magil emanating from Claybelle... I can only imagine the effect it might have on humans and dragons alike...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Lil, take that girl with you and run into town. You must warn the people there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>But what about you, Zafeiris?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I will...try to stop her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>L-let me help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but I cannot fight her and protect you at the same time. Claybelle is one of the seven great dragons. She is a dragon who still preserves her primordial form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But you can trust me. You know I'll do everything I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>O-okay... But you have to promise you'll come back to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Claybelle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Fool. I told you to...run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I can't just leave you like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>There is no way to save me now. This illness infects not the body, but the soul. My magil is contaminated...corrupted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Still!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I can't abandon a friend. I won't! Not again. Not anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hmph... Haha. A friend, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Then you know what you have to do. Don't hesitate. Kill me. I don't want to harm my disciples, nor any of the other humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>That is the greatest mercy you can give me right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Ooooooghh!</td>
