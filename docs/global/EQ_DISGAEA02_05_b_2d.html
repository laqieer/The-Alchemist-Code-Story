<td>The light that the Phantom Soldiers emerged from is disappearing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We...won, dood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Still, I wonder what made it happen so suddenly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Heh. It's obvious! Fearing the power of the Overlord Laharl, they decided to surrender themselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Haaahahahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...Yeah, I'm not so sure about that, but now all that's left is to find the yellow rabbit, Prince.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Right! Well then, yellow rabbit, you can run but you can't hide! Envylia's castle town lies right before my eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>?! Aha...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh? What's the matter, Prince?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Heheh... I've been struck with an idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh? Is it to "abdicate the Overlord throne to Etna"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Is it to "appreciate this Prinny's abilities and give him a raise," dood?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, that's right. If I'm your vassal, I need to be getting paid as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'd prefer to have that Prinny instead of pay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>All of you, enough of your nonsense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No! I was struck with the idea that I should rule this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Did you give up on your search for the rabbit, dood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Never! I'll find that rabbit! I'll rule this world! After all, I'm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...an Overlord!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Right! I forgot about that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You've got this one, Prince! You're a demon amongst demons, dooood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Right? Right?! That "forgot" part was a little unnecessary...but, anyway, it's a good idea, isn't it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So, Prince, how exactly are you going to do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>First of all, I'm going to defeat this country called Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Let's go, all of you! After me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Heheh. Eventually, I'll kill the Prince once he's taken over this world, and I'll rule everything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Heh. And, ultimately, this world will belong to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh? When did you also start aiming for world domination?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh, Miss Rosa, if you become the ruler, can I switch my loyalty to you, dood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Of course, I'll be needing a raise in my salary though, dood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Of course...since you'll be my pet...you'll be working for me for free.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hey, why did the conditions get even worse?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You idiots!!! I am the Overlord!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Having finally pierced the clouds, the witches roam freely throughout the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What lies ahead for Lisbeth, Alma, and Rebecca as they work together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>And what about Edgar imprisoned in the dungeon? Will Dias complete his role within the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>All will be revealed next in THE ALCHEMIST CODE, Chapter 3 Episode 4: "The Silver Lining". Hope you enjoy it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hey, Etna, what's with the serious promo?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh, Prince. Well, since we've been given this crossover opportunity, we can't just be silly the whole time...right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wrong. The sillier the better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I see. Then would you like to redo everything again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hmph. I've got no time for that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Right, of course!</td>
</tr>
