<td>That's amazing Soren! It took us considerable effort to take even a single Construct down, but they're dropping like flies before you.</td>

<td>Perhaps you've found a weakness in them?</td>

<td>I've figured out a thing or two from our battle against Asuka and Atropos.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>A machine as complex as Atropos would require some sort of a power converter, which converts Alchemia into energy for it to function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I figured the Constructs functioned in a similar manner, albeit with smaller power converters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Once I figured out where the converters are, it wasn't difficult to overload them with a small burst of Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>And based on what I've gathered, I hypothesized that the Constructs would be far more vulnerable to Alchemia overload!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Like how I disabled Atropos previously! But without blowing anything up this time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wow...! That's... That's great Soren!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>These Constructs won't be such a big threat now that we have an effective counter to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(This boy is a walking Avatar of Alchemy! Such precise control of Alchemy is almost unheard of!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>(And that is precisely why he must find his path correctly.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(He is destined for great things, for better or worse...)</td>
