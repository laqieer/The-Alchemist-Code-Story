<td>No... They followed me all the way out here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Get him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Nrk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're on my turf now. Prepare yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Y-you! These guys are after me! Please run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Run? Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I do what I need to, and that's all. If I don't have to, I don't bother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh, well. I'll take care of both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The white sands of this desert are my domain. I won't let anyone kill someone who has come here seeking shelter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You want me to be your Vice-Captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Got a problem with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A problem, you ask... I'm just a stray taking refuge here. I don't think I'm fit to become your Vice-Captain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I can't think of anyone else who would work. That's why I'm naming you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Out of all of the members of the Desert Wings, you're the most knowledgeable and efficient in your work. On top of that, you're very well-mannered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I think you're a good fit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(That's just how I was raised living in that house, taught by that person...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm extremely sorry, but could I ask for some time to consider this matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Of course. Do as you'd like. Just know that I'm hoping for the answer I want to hear. You becoming Vice-Captain would make my work much easier...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Allow me to take my leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That which allows you to stand a head above others is not your fortune, but your commitment to the precepts of nobility and dignity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If you say so... I really dunno... I mean, I do not know exactly what you are trying to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It isn't what I am saying, Master Ankh. It is what is inside of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What? I don't get what you mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You mustn't forget. Even if you lose your standing as nobility, you can still live a dignified life as long as you do not forget it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Very soon the assassin your younger brother hired will be arriving to do away with you. Please leave this house and escape. Please...live on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(We haven't seen each other since that day. I've only heard rumors that my brother seized power and eliminated that house.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(And after Master Ryle saved me, he took me in without asking about my circumstances. He protected me as a member of his guild.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(So of course I want to support him. However—)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Of course! We'll take your search request here. But, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What? Is there some kind of problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No, there's no problem, but... Aren't you Ankh of the Desert Wings? I was wondering why you would come here for such a request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It wouldn't do for me to ask the others to get involved in my personal affairs... You understand, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>O-oh, my apologies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(The number of assassins has decreased recently, but my brother is likely still after me. If I make any mistakes, it would cause a big commotion. But even so...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Even so, if I could only meet him one more time, maybe I could find some answers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ah, excuse me! You're the person who just submitted a request, right? Did the receptionist accept it right away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>There's a very long queue now, so... Seems like it'll take a long time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ah... I wonder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I heard this guild was good for finding people, but I'm still on the fence about it. So I'm asking around for more information...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Just between you and me, the guildmaster here doesn't have the best reputation. Do you know what kind of person he is, Mister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Mister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No. I'm not very familiar with this. But now, I'll be going—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>"We have an update about your request. Please report to the location written here. We await your arrival." I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>They work fast...is what I'd like to think, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(...And this is quite a remote location, too...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Thanks for coming! Sorry to make you come all the way out here. I have an update regarding your request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Straight from the mouth of the guildmaster. I'm very grateful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Not at all. This case was very much one that I had to confirm myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You must be Ankh... It's time to die.</td>
</tr>
