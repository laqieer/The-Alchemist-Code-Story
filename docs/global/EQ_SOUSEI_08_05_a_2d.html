<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>So Superbia Belt is actually the vestiges of the dragons' world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Just a small fragment of it, but yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Which is apparently why this is considered to be the only worthy spot to carry out the technique the dragons created—that being the Ceremony of Creation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wait, you mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's why Father calls the people of Superbia Belt the Pride of the region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>They know they're going to be sacrificed, and welcome that fate with open arms. They're actually proud of the fact that they're the ones chosen to be the foundation of the new world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>These humans, so weak and transient in their existence, hold their inevitable demise as some kind of twisted mark of actual Pride!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What a bleak outlook...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Naturally. The very laws of the world—the Truth, as we know it—will be rewritten from dust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There will be no small number of casualties, and many beyond that will be forced to abandon their lives as they've known them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>In a way, though, you're just like them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You're willing to literally lay down your life to fulfill an uncertain goal. How is that any different?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>They really are just like me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So you finally see it too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I do. But there is one difference. In my case...I take no pride in the death that awaits me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's little more than self-indulgence, really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'll stop Shahel, and the Ceremony of Creation. I'll show you that I really can shoulder this burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm sure that my brother, too, would wish just as strongly to save the people of this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Seems pretty prideful to me. Maybe even arrogant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Perhaps so. You would not be the first to regard me as such.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But say what anyone will of me, I intend to see this through to the very end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes, you do. That much is clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Crystal. And I'm afraid it makes you our enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ignacio!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well met, Emmel. Apologies for interrupting your conversation. It's...all I seem to be doing to people today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ignacio, I—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I overheard everything. You're planning to stop the Ceremony of Creation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ignacio...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I may be prone to outbursts from time to time, but I still consider myself a good and loyal son. If that Ceremony is what my "father" wishes, then I will do what I can to see it transpire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>And what of the wishes of your sister? Would you hear those out as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Dear sister, you're not wishing, you're acting. Impulsively, at that. And I can't very well hear out actions, now, can I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You little...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Look. You're not a high elf. You do know what that means, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well... Of course I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I don't. What am I missing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>As I mentioned before, we high elves are the Gardeners created by the dragons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>And gardeners using their gardening tools to take lives would not only be tragic, it would ruin the tools as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>To safeguard against this, we high elves have a warding mechanism in place that keeps us from hurting one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>So your very own life is...bound?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That's a very good way to put it, yes. But this ward does not apply to humans. And right now, we have a human who very much intends to shoot us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Be on your guard. Ignacio might not be the best at using magic, but his fighting skills and, more to the point, his accuracy are definitely a cut above!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Stop moving! You're just making it harder for me to shoot you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>But you are going to shoot, either way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Of course I am! And I'll certainly try not to hit any vital organs, but that would be a lot easier if you'd just stop moving so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You're not exactly selling that plan...</td>
</tr>
