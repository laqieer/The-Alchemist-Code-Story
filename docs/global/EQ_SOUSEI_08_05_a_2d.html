<td>Ignacio...</td>

<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>I may be prone to outbursts from time to time, but I still consider myself a good and loyal son. If that Ceremony is what my "father" wishes, then I will do what I can to see it transpire.</td>

<td>Dear sister, you're not wishing, you're acting. Impulsively, at that. And I can't very well hear out actions, now, can I?</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/helene.png" alt="Helene" height="128"><br>Helene</td>
<td>As I mentioned before, we high elves are the Gardeners created by the dragons.</td>
</tr>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/helene.png" alt="Helene" height="128"><br>Helene</td>
<td>And gardeners using their gardening tools to take lives would not only be tragic, it would ruin the tools as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/helene.png" alt="Helene" height="128"><br>Helene</td>
<td>To safeguard against this, we high elves have a warding mechanism in place that keeps us from hurting one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>So your very own life is...bound?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/helene.png" alt="Helene" height="128"><br>Helene</td>
<td>That's a very good way to put it, yes. But this ward does not apply to humans. And right now, we have a human who very much intends to shoot us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/helene.png" alt="Helene" height="128"><br>Helene</td>
<td>Be on your guard. Ignacio might not be the best at using magic, but his fighting skills and, more to the point, his accuracy are definitely a cut above!</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/emme.png" alt="Emmel" height="128"><br>Emmel</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Stop moving! You're just making it harder for me to shoot you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/helene.png" alt="Helene" height="128"><br>Helene</td>
<td>But you are going to shoot, either way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Of course I am! And I'll certainly try not to hit any vital organs, but that would be a lot easier if you'd just stop moving so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/helene.png" alt="Helene" height="128"><br>Helene</td>
<td>You're not exactly selling that plan...</td>
