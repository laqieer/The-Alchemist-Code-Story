<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>A few hours earlier in Saga region. Where the road diverges towards Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>All right, Kazahaya. I'm sorry, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The main Greed Dike army is currently headed towards Saga. Their final destination is Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes. Assuming the worst possible outcome...that Saga's Matter has been taken...we must tighten our guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Of course. We have no intention of letting them do as they please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Captain Othima...please, you must stop Orion's march.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Trust me. I'd love nothing better than to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Still, even if we cannot stop Greed Dike's invasion...if we manage to steal their Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm thinking we may be able to reverse the tide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sacred Stone...? Are you referring to Envylia's Leviathan? If so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>No...I'm talking about Greed Dike's Sacred Stone Mammon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Greed Dike's Sacred Stone...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes. This is the shrewd Orion we're speaking of. I'm assuming he's not complacent enough to leave the Sacred Stone Mammon in his country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There's a high chance he's carrying it with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I see! An eye for an eye, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Indeed. If we manage to obtain it, we won't be placed at a disadvantage when it comes to the sheer number of Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. However, I doubt matters will go so smoothly...judging by the look Basheeny's face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You really are an honest one, aren't you? It's written all over your face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh... Well, um...how can I say it...I just recalled something that's been bothering me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Bothering you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's just a rumor...one that I heard when I was with Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Apparently, Orion is harboring Greed Dike's Sacred Stone Mammon within his body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The Sacred Stone...is within his body?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ah, well...it's only a rumor. However, if it's true, it can pose some serious problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It was such an absurd story, I had completely forgotten about it. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I see... So that's why Orion has been obsessing over Nimul's power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Sorry, Kazahaya...there's another thing I wish to relay to Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>In fact...it's by far the most important thing she must know about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>The most important...?! What is it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>There is a possibility that Orion is a Vessel of Reincarnation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...I'm sorry, but you must convey this to Kanon...even at the risk of death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Present day. Somewhere in Saga. A windy hill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What a deep blue sky...what bright and warm sunshine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What a wonderful view! It surpasses anything I've imagined!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's a far outcry from Slothstein's foggy sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Who would've thought such a beautiful sky existed in this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Soon, this sky will belong to us, the Lost Blue! The mere thought fills me with excitement!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...Hey, redhead...you'll lend me your strength as well, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>If you're from Wadatsumi, then you must've lost your sky as well, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...Don't put me in the same boat as you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Jeez... Well, I guess that's what happens when people have different definitions of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Never mind. Not only will I change your rigid worldview, but I'll change this entire world as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>This entire world...? That sounds like a pipe dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>A pipe dream...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>How long do you think the Holy Guard and the ruling countries are gonna let your tyranny go unchecked?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>They'll wipe that smirk off your face soon enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Are you sure about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Of course, I am! At the very least...after what you did to Yauras...I will never, ever forgive you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Those who live for the moment...will never carve their names in history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You'll never grasp the world if you remain focused on just one aspect of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It's only the arrogance of those who live in their minuscule worlds who think there is only one truth in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What are you talking about?! Speak in a way that I can understand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>No need to rush things. Eventually, you'll be forced to understand...when this sky belongs to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...Anyway! Enough of that...let's enjoy this deep blue sky for now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hahah! Honestly...it makes me feel lucky to be alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What's wrong with you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Maybe you should be asking them instead of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Them...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...?! What the... Who are those troops?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Halt! So...you're the one who's been working in cohorts with the Greed Dike army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Gluttony Foss, huh? If you don't wish to die then go home. I have no business with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>What did you say...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>The woman called Seida has your Sacred Stone Beelzebub, doesn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I said that I have no time to waste on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...! So...you know about that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I've heard rumors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I also know that woman Seida isn't one to easily reveal the location of the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>In that case, wouldn't it be more efficient to aim for something certain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Something certain...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The sacred crystals which belong to the Saga tribes called Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I plan to quickly get my hands on them. I have no business with you people who have no Sacred Stone of your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>How dare you...! Even if you have no business with us, we have business with you! Attack!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>...Get back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Ack...! Artillery...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>If you don't want to die then stay put there. Honestly. To think I was going to spare his life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>...! What are you gonna do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>A little warm up. I'm gonna destroy Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...Bang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Aghhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Ca-Captain! Our pincer assault was blown apart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Impossible! What happened?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>N-no way... You took out all those soldiers with one blow?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Don't worry. I won't lay a hand on you...not until I can get ahold of your Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Wa-wait! Stop!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Kingdom of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Huff...huff... All that's left are those so-called "experiments," but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Argh... They're too strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...Not good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Huff...huff...! ...Hyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Even though they're  strong individually, if we work together, we should be able to take them down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Exactly! It's not like you to cave in Captain Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>No... I'm not talking about Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Look how much we're struggling against this scouting party. They're not even the main army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>And the mysterious Templars are the ones leading them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>If Greed Dike were to come at us with full force, even Northern Pride may not stand a chance...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...! Kanon is in danger...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>...?! Chloe! Don't let your guard down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>?! O-oh no...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Chloe!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>...That must be quite some skill to catch you off guard from behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>What's is going on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Spica...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Ag...ggh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>...! It's not done yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>...Hyaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Gggaah...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>You gotta be kidding me! You're not getting away with doing whatever you want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Bud...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Spica, please! Head to Northern Pride!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>...? Northern Pride?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Greed Dike's army is making its way there as we speak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Captain Vettel, she is familiar with Kanon as well! I'm sure she will be an asset to the Holy Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>We of the Scarlet Flame Guard can't afford to leave our posts here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>However, with the king now dead...and you of the Blue Flame Guard having lost your role as the Royal Guard, you should be able to move about as you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Bud...I ask you this as a fellow Flame Guard captain... Would you please deliver her to Northern Pride?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Me? But...for the sake of my scattered comrades of the Blue Flame Guard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>If Northern Pride falls...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Not only Envylia, but the entire continent of Babel will be engulfed in darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>After I finish off the Greed Dike soldiers here, I'll follow after you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I understand your dedication to your men, but...please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>...! Captain Vettel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Kanon is in danger! Please, Spica! Lend Kanon your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Meanwhile...in Saga region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>No...way! How could you take out all those soldiers...in such a short time?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>The deciding factor of strength in battle is not the number of soldiers. If you can't understand that...then you have no right to be in command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Ug...ghh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>I was planning on letting you go...but you really are an idiot, aren't you? Goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Wa-wait! Al-alright...! I'll tell you the location of the Sacred Stone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I-I'll tell you the whereabouts of our Sacred Stone Beelzebub!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>So, please, spare my life! I have a newborn child!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Indeed. Well, where is Beelzebub currently located?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>It's been securely kept in the army's headquarters! Let me take you there immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>...I see. You must be executed after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>We have an absolute law that we must never lie. You have broken this law. Thus, you will be executed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Wa-wait...! Please, wait!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>If Beelzebub was in Gluttony, wouldn't they first and foremost solidify their defenses there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>That Seida woman, who is famous for her shrewdness, would never hide it somewhere so obvious...idiot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>!!! Wh...what have you done?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>It's all right. He was instantaneously turned into ashes. He wouldn't have felt any pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>H-how insignificant is a human's life to you?! You crushed him as if he were an insect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Are you saying you'd be fine with me killing an insect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Huh...? No...it's not that I would be fine with it, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Humans, insects, plants...they're all living entities, aren't they? Do you mean to tell me that one life is worth more than another?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>...Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>You people speak of valuing life...but, you're wrong. A life itself has no value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Do you understand your stupidity in valuing each life while their numbers are countless?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Stupidity...?! How dare you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Don't you realize the contradiction in your own argument?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Isn't that very mouth you use to utter such niceties also used to consume animals?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Sacrifices must be made in order to survive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>We pay respect to the creatures we consume as food. We're not the same as you! You slaughter with no regard to the life you've ended!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Heheh. The frenzy in your voice is more than enough to prove you aware of the contradiction in your logic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Humans eat other creatures, thus terminating their lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>No matter how eloquently you put it, that's the unwavering truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>It's in human's nature to lengthen their own lives by robbing other creatures of theirs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Agh... Then...if you say that life itself has no value, then where does value exist?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>It's obvious. It exists in our resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Our resolve...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Our resolve will continue on long afterward our spirit and flesh perish. You understand that, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>All things physical will fade away one day. There is no value there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>There is only one thing that determines the value of life-resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>So...there's no sin in taking the lives of others then?! There's something fundamentally wrong with your way of thinking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>No matter how much I try to convince you, I doubt you'd understand. You've never seen the "dimension beyond."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>...Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Ah, nothing. More importantly, we have company.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Company...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Are they...from the tribes of Saga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Enough talk. Come on...let's go, redhead. The first Matter is already right before our eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Wa-wait...stop!!!</td>
