<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Thank you for saving the village! You're all super strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's right! The supreme one, The Overlord of Scorching Flames, Red Magnus—his super strength transcends all others'! Bwah-hahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Besides, you're also really kind! I'm so glad that such nice people noticed me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Your gratitude is making me blush a little, plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I am, after all, the Overlord of Sympathy with deep compassion for others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I just cannot turn a blind eye when I see someone in trouble. Oh-hohohoho!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well, you did say, "I absolutely refuse to do something that won't even gain me a single HL!"...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Agaaah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh? I thought I heard something earlier too, but what was that sound just now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It was nothing, my dear Miss Rin. Oh-hohohoho!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's just business as usual. Don't worry about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Really? Well, as long as everything's okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I-it's not, dood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>D-did you people protect our village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Thank you! You've saved our lives. Please...let us repay you somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh, it was nothing really, but...I'd be happy to settle for 100 million HL?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We don't need 100 million HL.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Do you think you can provide us with potatoes, onions, beef or pork...or even poultry for that matter, along with some spices?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What? That's all you're asking for? Oh, you're more than welcome to however much you want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The vegetables of this village are our pride! And, of course, the meat too! Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That being said, I'm sorry, but...when it comes to spices, pepper is about all we've got. Will that be all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You only have pepper? That won't do. Could you procure something else somehow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well, you saved our lives, so we'd like to do what we can, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...That's it! How about you pay a visit to Envylia's castle town?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm sure they'll have spices. You can procure anything there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What should we do, Sir Killia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Without spices, I can't make the curry. We've got no choice but to pay a visit to the castle town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This castle town...how do you get there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>First, you leave the village and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(Oh...I'm craving curry, plip...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Excuse me...Usalia? Your mind seemed to be wandering, dood. Were you able to catch the directions to the castle town?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Wha...?! Um, right now, I was considering how to tackle the International Pollution Control Measures!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So, you weren't listening, dood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(Heheh...all right! Don't move, now... Just a little more! Only a little more!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hey! Li'l Usa! Red Magnus figured out how to get to the castle town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh? What was that just now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What's the matter, dood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No, just now...hmm. Ah, never mind! It's nothing! Come on, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Dood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh...we need to go now? The villagers were such nice people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...Don't worry, Miss Rin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>All of you, thank you so much for saving our village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If you're ever in the vicinity again, please don't hesitate to visit our village! You are always welcome!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh, did you hear that? If you come back to this village, they'll befriend you, plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes...you're right! Thank you, miss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You can call me Usalia...you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Then you can just call me Rin as well! Usalia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>O-okay...well, let's go...Rin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(Argh! So close...! Still, there's no way I'm giving up!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>~♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You seem in high spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yep! Envylia's castle town is a real beautiful place with lots of people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It was sad to say goodbye to the villagers, but I have a feeling I'll be able to make more friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I just hope I can meet a lot of people in the castle town!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Rin, it's nice to see you having fun, plip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yes, that's lovely and all, but are we on the right road? This forest is humid and unpleasant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Heh. What's that, Sera? Don't tell me an Overlord like you is getting scared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Of course, I'm not scared. I'm the Overlord of Gorgeous, in case you've forgotten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I prefer places that are more glitzy and gorgeous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>True. I'm the Overlord of Scorching Flame. This kind of gloomy forest isn't to my taste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I like places that are, you know...burning with super erosive magma!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah. Keep eroding until you burn yourself out while you're at it, you muscle-brained monkey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What did you say?! Stop paying me compliments!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>That totally wasn't a compliment! How is it even possible to reach that conclusion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Wait. Something's approaching. Everyone, hide!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Phantom Soldiers...again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hey, did you see that? They appeared from a Dimension gate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>How?! I can't open mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Ouroboros talked about "entangling the Dimension Gate with the Door of Truth." That might be the cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Everyone...at this rate, those Phantom Soldiers will make their way to the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Rin, I understand. We won't let them, plip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What?! We're going to fight again? Haven't we done enough? I mean, we've already saved them once...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Madam Overlord Seraphina...Sir Killia seems like he's onboard, dood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>A Fluffy Cockatrice Meat and Egg Bowl... The rich taste of cockatrice meat along with the lavish use of four creamy eggs...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Um. Sir Killia, I'm not sure if now's the time to be coming up with new recipes, dood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Sir Killia...are you going to fight as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I will. I cannot overlook the villagers' kindness in providing me with ingredients for the curry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Oh well...you're my future husband. If you're going to fight, Sir Killia, then you give me no choice. Let's hurry up and finish them off!</td>
</tr>
