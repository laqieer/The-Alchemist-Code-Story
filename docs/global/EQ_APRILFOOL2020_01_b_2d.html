<td>It's said that those who summon a girl at the foot of the legendary tower can find eternal happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p_name></td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>You were standing right next to said legendary tower when I first saw you. Though it would seem that was not your reason for being there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p_name></td>
<td>Oh! Uh... no. I've never heard that before. I'm not even sure how I ended up outside the Venus School of Magic, to be honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Excuse me? There's no such school in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p_name></td>
<td>Huh? But that's gotta be the Venus School of Magic! If this is TAC, then—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Well, at least you got that part correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p_name></td>
<td>What d'you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>TAC. As in, TAC Academy. It's the name of my school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p_name></td>
<td>TAC Academy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>I see... Nations warring for possession of sacred stones, people summoning soldiers from beyond the grave through the use of alchemic powers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>It's an interesting setting for a story, I'll give it that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p_name></td>
<td>Right?! I really love this one character, Kaya, the Crimson Dragon—it's super weird how much you look like her, actually...</td>

<td>Oh, really? My name is Kaya, in fact. What a funny coincidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p_name></td>
<td>No way! You look the same, you've got the same name—this goes way beyond coincidence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/kaya.png" alt="Kaya" height="128"><br>Kaya</td>
<td>What can I say? This is the first I've heard of such a character.</td>

<td>As for me, I'm the president of the archaeology club here at TAC Academy.</td>

<tr>
<td><p_name></td>
<td>TAC Academy... There's something fishy about this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/kaya.png" alt="Kaya" height="128"><br>Kaya</td>
<td>You think so? I'm not sure I fully understand, but if you believe there might be clues inside the academy... this could prove rather interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p_name></td>
<td>Well, I don't even know if I can get back to my world... but I guess doing a little investigation would be the first step to finding out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Your... world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p_name></td>
<td>Yup. I mean, I'm not sure if I actually want to go back yet or not, but I've at least got to find out if it's possible. I'm gonna head up to the school—thanks again for helping me!</td>

<td>Oh! My bad. You can call me <p_name>.</td>

<tr>

<td>Uhh... Y'know, I hadn't really thought about that.</td>
