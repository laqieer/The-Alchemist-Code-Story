<td>- Greed Dike, Zheng Yi's Mansion -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Sometime before the attack on Roxanne's manor...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Good evening, Lord Zheng Yi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...Master Li Wang. An odd time to visit, would you not agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If it isn't urgent, may I suggest leaving it till the morrow? My servants will be glad to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Tsk tsk. Is this how you treat visitors?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm here to address some...concerns I had from the last meeting, and I'd rather hear it straight from the horse's mouth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Time is money, as you well know. So let's not dance around the subject.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What are you planning to do with Atropos?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I beg your pardon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Don't play coy, Lord Zheng Yi. It doesn't suit you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We both know there's only one reason it isn't public information...if you catch my drift.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That is quite the accusation, Master Li Wang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No? You mean to tell me you're actually doing this for "the greater good"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, it's none of my business what you tell yourself to sleep better at night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Here, I have an offer for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Li Wang sets down a hefty briefcase on the desk, smirking as he clicks it open.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...What is the meaning of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This, AND all the power you'll need in Greed Dike to enact your "grand vision," whatever it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>All I ask is you let me in on it, hmm? A fair exchange, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Surely you know how much they despise you out there. Oh, they're all smiles in front of you, but it's just teeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Your little debacle over that failed project all but dropped you from their favor. Altruism doesn't make money, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But it doesn't have to be that way. You're a clever man, Lord Zheng Yi. I don't need to spell it out for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Perhaps not when you had wanted my head on a silver platter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Your...servants left quite the impression. I do not think I need to elaborate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Tch. Petty, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Assassination, "petty"? Then again, I suppose when the law bends under the weight of gold, anything is possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You have no right speaking of justice to me when it exists only for you and your ilk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hahaha! So that's how it's gonna be, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I gave you an easy way out and this is what I get in return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ah well. I'm sure we both expected this to happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What are you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Li Wang's men burst into the room and begin rifling through every drawer in sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What have you done with my guards?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Those lazy fools? Probably peacefully napping under a tree somewhere or other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I suggest you stay out of the way if you don't want any...accidents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Or you can help speed things up if you'd just hand over everything you have on the Core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You've gone too far, Li Wang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Tch. I hate dogs who need a good kicking to roll over.</td>
