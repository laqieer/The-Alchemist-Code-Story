<td>No. I cannot accept it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Please! Oh, please! I ask only that you wear one of my coatsâ€”just one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There is a magic to the words you speak when you lead us! Your powers are so wonderful, Lady Annika! All that you are is so splendid, and yet...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And yet I cannot focus on a single word you speak! So please, please, slip on one of these coats! I beg of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Enough. I refuse to drape myself in cloth. Now, I am going for a walk. I will return when the winds will it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No! Lady Annika...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ugh... Why must people try to make me wear clothes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>To cover the patterns that adorn my skin would be to sully them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>These marks maintain the sanctity of my very being. I see no reason why they should be wrapped in cloth and hidden from the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>All my cures are made with love! They are of the finest quality! Don't forget to dote upon your vendor, the oh so lovely merchant, Little Miss Margaret!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Heavens! It's Little Miss Margaret!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yoo-hoo! Look this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A merchant? Everyone is crowding around the stall. I suppose I might as well go and have a look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Thank you very much! Do come again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh! She has no patterns like mine, yet she is showing quite a lot of skin... It must be so that she can pick up on the flow of energy in nature!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hi, there! What can I do for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I am not a customer. I was only thinking that your clothes are very nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh? Well, thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You enjoy the feel of nature on your skin, do you not? Just as I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Umm... Sorry, but as you can see, I'm kinda busy selling my wares right now. Could you let me get back to work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Very well. I will wait until your business is concluded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>N-no, you see, what I was trying to say was... Oh, what have I gotten myself into here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hey, you! Who said you could set up shop here?! If you wanna run a stall 'round these parts, you've gotta pay the fee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh, my! Is that so? I had no idea! How careless of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hold on. What are you saying, sir? This place is for everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What, you a friend of hers or somethin'? Well, if one of you doesn't cough up the coin quick smart, I'm gonna knock the both of you into next week!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hmmm... This man radiates bad energy. He must be cleansed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I...have no idea what that means, but I think you might be right. Sometimes you just have to get your hands dirty.</td>
