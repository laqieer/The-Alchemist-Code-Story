<td>I... I thought you couldn’t shoot people?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I found my resolve because I wanted to protect you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Of course, there are ways to protect others without fighting...but that isn’t enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I can’t let you take a detour the way I did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I’m sorry it took me so long! I’ll fight to protect the people I care about too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But I told you to run away! You could’ve just abandoned me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why did you do this for me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...I told you! You aren’t alone! We’re friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This is...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The sound of the orchestral band! Our reinforcements!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>How strange... My ears don’t hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So this is what it means to not fight alone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>See? Aren’t “sounds” amazing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Even though we were just feeling like we couldn’t go on...now we feel relief. Listen... Do you feel the power to fight surging through your body?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(...Yes... She’s right about everything.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(My aspirations were a crutch to help me escape from the pressure... Nina wouldn’t try to fight on her own.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(She wouldn’t be irritated by supportive or hopeful voices... I wasn’t seeing clearly.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(...I’m an idiot. What was I rushing for?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(That’s what “sounds” helped me realize!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Bertie, are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Patty, Alaia! Yeah, I’m okay! Thank you for coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Don’t underestimate the ears of the band! It’s easy for us to guess the position and distance of a sound from its echoes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting! The Envylia Orchestral Band is here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Everyone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We’ve spotted the enemy reinforcements! All right, let’s begin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yeah! Something spirited, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What in the world...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>All right, the parade has begun! Get ready for the finest sounds! Here we go, Mendelssohn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It’s like... the sounds are seeping into my body...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It’s giving me power?! And my ears...don’t hurt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Music can help on the battlefield too. Even if it’s not a weapon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We also want to stand on the battlefield to protect the things we care about... We’re ready to hurt the enemy, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That’s...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>There you are, Bertha! I can’t believe you acted on your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ah! I’m sorry! I’m ready to be thoroughly scolded later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...Anyway, I commend you for sensing danger quickly! And thanks to the orchestral band, morale is high. Let’s annihilate our enemies while we can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Trainees, listen closely to your instructor’s orders and follow us! Let’s work together to crush our enemies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yes! ...Look, our own reinforcements have safely arrived! Aren’t “sounds” amazing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...All right, let’s go. I’ll give you instructions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Let’s win this so that I can fire a “welcome home” shot for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...Yes! I’ll borrow this weapon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...Thank you. I think it’ll be easy to swing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Once, I accidentally hurt a superior of mine while using a gun I couldn’t handle. Even though she was also trying to stop me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...But you’re not like me. You listened to what I had to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Please let me hear the whole story some day. ...I’ll be waiting for your signal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Got it! All right! How dare you hurt my trainee?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I won’t waver anymore. I’ll shoot as many bullets as I need to in order to protect everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>This is my...signal shot of resolve!</td>
