<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Yay! We made it! I'm so tired!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We really had our work cut out for us with all of those monsters attacking us. Now that we've made it this far, the rest should be easy from here on out. We just need to get this to the Court Mage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Then we can divide the Brown Cacao among us so we can all make chocolates together! I'm so excited! Aren't you, Leafah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Uh, yes! Right! I can't wait to see how I fare when making chocolates!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What's wrong, Leafah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh, um, nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hey, does something seem a bit...off to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yeah... People keep looking this way. Seems like they're waiting for the right moment or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Um... Is that Rainbow Cacao? Would you mind giving me some?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hey! That's not fair! I wanted some first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I as well! I know a lot of people that want some!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What is going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Argh... Move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>S-Suzuka? What happened!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Thief! The cacao has been stolen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What did you say! Quick, we have to go after...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Aah! Stop! Don't push! I'm going to be crushed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I can't believe a thief would choose the middle of the day, in the middle of the city nonetheless, to rob us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Argh! I can't believe I let it get stolen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No... With that many people surrounding us, it's only natural that we weren't able to react. I couldn't even draw my sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Itsuki is looking for the culprits now. All we can do is wait. The two of you should go let the Court Mage know what happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What is this commotion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's Valentine's Day, so the cacao...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Another big fuss over Valentine's Day... This makes how many times now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Rather than making cacao illegal, they should just ban Valentine's Day. I wouldn't mind that one bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Please wait one minute! It's true that there was a bit of confusion...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But the blame should not be put on Valentine's Day itself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But trouble like this always happens on Valentine's Day, doesn't it? Now we have to deal with muggings?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Just get rid of Valentine's Day altogether!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Th-that's not...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(To be fair, if Valentine's Day was banned, a lot of these incidents would most likely decrease since it's the source of all this.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(This isn't something to pin on Valentine's Day, but we also can't ignore that it is the catalyst of the incidents...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(...But is that okay?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You really lucked out, didn't you! Having people understand you through chocolate really is the best method out there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>After all, Valentine's Day is all about making your feelings known!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I...rather enjoy Valentine's Day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No... No. It's not okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Leafah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Valentine's Day is all about making your feelings known... I will not let anyone bring it down for everyone else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Leafah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Everyone, please listen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Just now an incident happened and I understand your worries and concerns. However, it occurred while we were transporting this cacao.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>In other words, this happened on my watch. I am the one who should be held responsible. This is not because of Valentine's Day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Valentine's Day is an event where you share your feelings, your future...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>A wonderful day where you take those feelings that you can't truly express and let them be known through chocolate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I am the one who was unable to protect that! And for that I am truly sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I am sorry for causing this! Please accept my apologies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>L-Leafah, it isn't only your burden to bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>No! It is my job as the General to bear the unease and anger of my people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It's fine! Fear not, for I am used to apologizing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Also, it'll take a lot more than something like this to destroy my pride as General!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Leafah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Well, when you put it like that... You know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Yeah... It feels almost as if we're picking on a child...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm not a child! It's just my face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You're right, this incident has nothing to do with Valentine's and the person who caused it should be blamed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'm back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Itsuki! What did you find out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I got pretty much everything we needed to know. These guys are a strong group of bandits that started up in this area recently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>They usually just target merchant carts, but since the Rainbow Cacao is so valuable, they pulled out all stops to get their hands on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Let's go, Leafah. The people won't have peace until these evil-doers are stopped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Let us restore Valentine's Day with our own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>All right! Let's go! I will show these bandits the valor of the General of Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
