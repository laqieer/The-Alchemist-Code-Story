<td>Hahaha! Zafeiris! Over here!</td>

<td>Calm down, now! You're liable to trip and fall.</td>

<td>Lil'</td>
<td>But I can fly! So even if I do, I won't get hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>R-right... Still, you should be more careful! Especially with your powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Your powers are closely tied to the Shell of the World. Enough recklessness and you easily could get hurt!</td>

<td>Ugh. How do I explain it in simpler terms?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>A dragon would have been born with a fully developed mind...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>This is as though I'm speaking with one of those human younglings my brother Nidhogg described to me once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>So, how's fatherhood going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Tell me, why did you leave her intellectual maturity underdeveloped as you were creating her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Were you not the one who said she needs an adequately functioning intellect for us to converse with her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>That's true. I did say that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>What I need you to understand, Zafeiris, is that I don't exactly hold our intelligence as dragons to be quite so sacred or righteous, as you do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>We've made mistakes. We've done many, many things we shouldn't have, and lost much as a result of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>I want her to take a different path than the one we took. I want her to learn things properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>I want her to learn on her own about this world, about us dragons, and about the humans who will replace us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Such optimistic idealism...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>I thought you'd approve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>There you go again, giving the silent treatment when things don't quite go your way. You really do need to work on that nasty habit of yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>We wouldn't want Lil to pick up such tendencies, now, would we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>Did somebody call me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Why, yes, we did! Zafeiris and I were just talking about how beautiful you are, Lil. You're just far too cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>Heheh! Lil is Schmeier's masterpiece, right? Of course I'm cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Oh, you little scamp. C'mere!</td>

<td>Lil'</td>
<td>Ahahaha! That tickles!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>

<td>(So then why is Schmeier even—?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>Zafeiris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>Nng! Up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>What is it? If you want something from me, use your words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Are you daft?! Pick her up, Zafeiris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Me? Why don't you do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>Schmeier did already! Now it's Zafeiris' turn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Oh, don't be such a sourpuss. You should appreciate her affection while you still can!</td>

<td>Up! Up!</td>

<td>That should be apparent. But if it's not, it will be soon.</td>

<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Do spare me the disingenuous sniveling and tell me why you've come.</td>
</tr>

<td>This is for the world. Our chief, Lord Ophioneus, has declared it to be necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>In his words, the Shell of the World must be eliminated, and it is time that we dragons overcome this trial as one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Ophioneus said that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>As such, those who would protect the Shell of the World are to be regarded as impediments toward that noble goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>And none are more guilty of acting in defense of the Shell than you and Schmeier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>It's almost astonishing to see so many of our kin, so near extinction, gathered in one place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>Please understand that the circumstances call for such measures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>Melvillei of Compassion has seen the end of this world. We haven't a moment to spare!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Do you think mentioning such an honored name alone can convince me to just step back and allow you to usher in our demise?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Nameless Dragon</td>
<td>Clearly not. You are among the most stalwart of us dragons. We will do what we must.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>So be it. Come, then!</td>
