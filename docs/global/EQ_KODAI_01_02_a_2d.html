<td>Hahaha! Zafeiris! Over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Calm down, now! You're liable to trip and fall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But I can fly! So even if I do, I won't get hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>R-right... Still, you should be more careful! Especially with your powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Your powers are closely tied to the Shell of the World. Enough recklessness and you easily could get hurt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I...don't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ugh. How do I explain it in simpler terms?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>A dragon would have been born with a fully developed mind...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This is as though I'm speaking with one of those human younglings my brother Nidhogg described to me once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So, how's fatherhood going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Tell me, why did you leave her intellectual maturity underdeveloped as you were creating her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Were you not the one who said she needs an adequately functioning intellect for us to converse with her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's true. I did say that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What I need you to understand, Zafeiris, is that I don't exactly hold our intelligence as dragons to be quite so sacred or righteous, as you do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>We've made mistakes. We've done many, many things we shouldn't have, and lost much as a result of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I want her to take a different path than the one we took. I want her to learn things properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I want her to learn on her own about this world, about us dragons, and about the humans who will replace us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Such optimistic idealism...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I thought you'd approve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>There you go again, giving the silent treatment when things don't quite go your way. You really do need to work on that nasty habit of yours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We wouldn't want Lil to pick up such tendencies, now, would we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Did somebody call me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Why, yes, we did! Zafeiris and I were just talking about how beautiful you are, Lil. You're just far too cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Heheh! Lil is Schmeier's masterpiece, right? Of course I'm cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh, you little scamp. C'mere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ahahaha! That tickles!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(How long is this pathetic farce supposed to continue?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(This was supposed to be a means for us to contact and converse with our environmental maintenance system, the Shell of the World, to help address the issues it's been experiencing.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(So then why is Schmeier even—?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Zafeiris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Nng! Up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What is it? If you want something from me, use your words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Are you daft?! Pick her up, Zafeiris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Me? Why don't you do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Schmeier did already! Now it's Zafeiris' turn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, don't be such a sourpuss. You should appreciate her affection while you still can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Up! Up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>All right, fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Heehee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>A considerable time passed in this manner, with our research remaining stagnant throughout. How could any progress be made under such absurd circumstances, after all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>So, this is your past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It seems far more...tranquil...than I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I am curious about several details, though—particularly how that little girl factors into everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That should be apparent. But if it's not, it will be soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>We dragons are fated to perish. That fact hasn't changed, even through all this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Curse you, Schmeier, for leaving all the material collection duties to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Though she is the central constituent in charge of research. I suppose I've done all that I can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I don't think I'm ready...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Lil's development is progressing well. It won't be long before we are granted full access to the Shell of—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Do I want this to end? Peace, a supportive confidant, and a child who shows me affection...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Perhaps this homely lifestyle has affected me more than I realize. The more I think about it—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Forgive our transgressions, Lord Zafeiris—incarnation of the seven miracles; our greatest, our savior!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Do spare me the disingenuous sniveling and tell me why you've come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>This is for the world. Our chief, Lord Ophioneus, has declared it to be necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>In his words, the Shell of the World must be eliminated, and it is time that we dragons overcome this trial as one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Ophioneus said that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>As such, those who would protect the Shell of the World are to be regarded as impediments toward that noble goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>And none are more guilty of acting in defense of the Shell than you and Schmeier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It's almost astonishing to see so many of our kin, so near extinction, gathered in one place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Please understand that the circumstances call for such measures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Melvillei of Compassion has seen the end of this world. We haven't a moment to spare!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Do you think mentioning such an honored name alone can convince me to just step back and allow you to usher in our demise?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Clearly not. You are among the most stalwart of us dragons. We will do what we must.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>So be it. Come, then!</td>
</tr>
