<td>Haha... Hahahahahaha! More! More!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No... How can this be? The stone's power should have been purified by Lord Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Indeed. It was quite the effort to find a way around that! Now, thanks to the Alchemia I have collected, I have succeeded!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You... No! You set the Jam upon the soldiers in order to take their Alchemia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ah... So you've finally realized. It is nothing compared to what it was before, but with Waginau out of the picture, it's more than enough to destroy you lot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Nnghh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hahahaha, wonderful! Take more Alchemia; more and more and more! Until I have ascended to the skies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Do you not understand how meaningless your pitiful attacks are? What is the point of clinging to hope?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Let me guess: you have some romantic notion that throwing your life away here is going to buy time for your little friends to get away. How adorable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's about time, isn't it? See for yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What is this vibrating sound...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Isidore! We've almost reached the Desert Zone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Great! We must get there as soon as possible, not just for ourselves, but for Kamui and the others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ur...gh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Malta?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Malta! Have you regained consciousness?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Miss Malta?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Where...are we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We're at the southern tip of Gluttony, near the border. We should be in the Desert Zone soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I see... I'm sorry, but...who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's not a funny joke, Miss Malta!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm sorry, I'm just...trying to get my bearings. I'm... Who am I? Why am I in this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No... It can't be. Amnesia? Could she really have forgotten Kamui, the village, and everything that happened?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Kamui...? Who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You... Just... Listen. You have nothing to worry about. I will protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>My hands have been stained with blood, but I promise you that no harm will come to you as long as Iâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Is this an e-earthquake?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No... I sense that energy that makes me feel like my skin is on fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>A giant wave of the Jam?! Hisham! Get over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Why did you think we waited so patiently for you to finish all of your preparations?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No... No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>How pitiful! You hoped to save them all, but failed! Yes! This is what I wanted! To see the total devastation on your face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ceclidis!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yes! Let all that anger and hatred build! Who needs compassion?! Who needs light?! This is the true face of humankind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We are all just beasts pretending to be civilized!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Uuaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Fall into the darkness! Fall and let your corrupted Alchemia feed my Shadow Excelsior!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>No! Kamui, no! Don't listen to him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Wh-what...? T-Teona?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Urk?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Kamui... Are you...okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Teona! Why?! Why would you do this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Wh-why...? I just...saw Hisham's crying face...in my mind...and then my body just...moved on its own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>D-don't speak! The blood... Teona! Hold it together! Teona!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Forget me... It's already...too late. You should...focus on the battle...now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I can't just give up on you! I can't... What do I do now?! What is the point?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I...was a little jealous...of Hisham.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Heh... I've been training...since I was a kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>My father was...so strict... I never had...anyone I could...count on to have my back. In that, perhaps...you and I are...similar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Teona...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Don't...give up... Kamui, you...still live. Still breathe. Hisham...is waiting for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Teona! You're the one who can't give up yet! You haven't died yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It's...fine. There's nothing...left that I need to...do... Wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>There was...that one thing... That rematch with you... Hahaha... Even...at the end, I am...still a gladiator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Come on, Teona. Let's have that rematch. I'll do anything, just don't let go! Teona!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Th-that's...a date... Haha... Kam...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Teona? Teona!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Are you done yet? It is really beyond the pale for someone like you to keep me waiting like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You must open the door that bars you from the great Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You have the power to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I see... This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Wh-what is this?! What is this light?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>What's happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I...see... So I was swallowed by the Door of Truth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>So you have remembered everything now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Yes... In the end, I wasn't able to save anyone or anything. Not Malta, not Isidore...not Hisham, not Teona...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I meant, have you found the answer yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Answer...? How could someone like me have any kind of answer? What meaning does my life even have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>What is this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>This...warmth... Wait, I recognize it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>This is the warmth of Sephiron, which had protected us for so long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Protector of the Sephira, last of your line, you have indeed lost all that you once had.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>However, there is still something left for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I can still live on... As long as I live, there is still a chance. This is not the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>There may still be survivors in the desert, hoping for rescue. I have to believe that! I cannot give up on them yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>No matter how difficult or painful it might be, I must move forward. I swear upon Sephiron that I will save anyone I can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Is that your answer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You will choose compassion instead of hardening your heart against the world to protect yourself from pain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Compassion...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>In that case, there is no need for a contract. Consequently, there is no reason for you to remain in this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>There is strength within you already. Strength that came from the great tree Sephiron, the ancient Door that has now been lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Strength...from Sephiron? This warmth is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Yes. The ancient shamans of Saga once called forth the ancient forest with their memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>In the same way, you will likely be able to call forth the forgotten legacies of those warriors who linger within the Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>That power is no longer one which can change the world. However, I suspect it is more than enough to change the lives of humankind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Return from whence you came, Protector. Carry with you the hope that burns in your heart. It will lead you through whatever hardship and cruelty you must endure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I shall take you where you need to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I'm...in the Desert Zone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Carry with me the hope that burns in my heart, huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Then...I shall do as I resolved. I will go and protect any survivors I am able to find.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>This is the duty I now choose for myself. This is now what it means to be the Protector of the Sephira!</td>
