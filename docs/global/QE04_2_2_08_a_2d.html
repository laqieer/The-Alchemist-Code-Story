<td>Listen to you little brats...spouting your mouths off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm well aware that I'm speaking out of turn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>However, please understand that we haven't come to you with some half-baked resolve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's only recently that I've learned to consider all of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Until then, I was too busy worrying about my own tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>However, meeting Mocca here has changed me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I believe that we can work together regardless of tribe or faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tina...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I would be lying if I said I didn't understand how you felt. This is how you must have felt when you stood before Alia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't intend to question your choice or Alia's. However...two Wind Shamans have now appeared before us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I feel Asena's will in this. Something big is going on here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Can we not work together once again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I won't coerce you into anything. For me, it's enough that I know now what Alia's resolve was and what yours is now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Um... Is there something I can do to help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Can the power of the wind inside me...be put to some use?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I think what you're already doing to help is amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>She's right. Ever since you were born, Tamis, you've shouldered a significant burden. It could've easily been me instead of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But...I'm just a vessel. I want to do something like you, Mocca. I want to help Saga in some way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Is there any way to borrow Tamis' power and restore the Wind Matter? Voda...would you know something about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hmm. Well, its power has already been depleted once. However, we have two Wind Shamans here. There may be some way to make it work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Fuu, do you know of some way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I doubt he has any answers either. After all, he's had both the vessel of the Wind Matter and a Wind Shaman by his side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>For the sake of Saga, I'm sure he tried various tactics to restore the Wind Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>However, his attempts were unsuccessful...isn't that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It is as you say. I've made various attempts, but nothing happened. That's why I sought Tina's power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ah. If my power alone isn't enough then perhaps the two of us together may be able to succeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Mocca...what do you want me to do? I'll do anything to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Tamis...can you stand here? Tina, follow my lead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>....?! Is this still not enough?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I can feel the pulsation a little stronger than when it was just you, Mocca, but still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I guess we lack the strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's not just your problem. Right now, the tribes of fire, water, wind, and earth are all turned inward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>When they can unite together and work hand-in-hand...perhaps only then can the power of the wind truly be revived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>And Saga can be restored to its former glory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Right! I just remembered that, other than her Ouija, Tina also has the power of Alchemy. Perhaps that would be of some use!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>No, unfortunately...although Ouija and Alchemy appear similar, they are two separate entities. It wonâ€™t change the results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Right now, the most important thing is to unite all of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Bad news! The Gluttony army is at our gates!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>A general, who goes by the name Georgios, is leading the army! Fuu, what should we do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Georgios!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hold on, Tina!</td>
</tr>
