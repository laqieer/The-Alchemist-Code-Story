<td>Engineer Elect Adaleigh's airship has been housed in Dock 6. The entire crew is being detained within the port.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I appreciate your efforts. Please continue to monitor them. And no needless provocations, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...This is for the best, I suppose, Icona.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ah yes, this is more than enough, Mr. Mayor. It's not the case that they want to perpetrate violence in this region, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's just that they want to kill the Cursed Beast here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Though that would put us in trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Belphegor is one of the precious resources left to this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The lode of the Gods is certainly a vast resource, but we can't be confident that it is enough for every researcher to achieve their goals...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>For our prosperity... For the continuation of all research, no resource could be sufficient, no matter how vast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>For precisely this reason, losing a Cursed Beast capable of infinitely producing magil would be much too regrettable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So that everyone has an equal opportunity to pursue their own research?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It is my duty as mayor to continue to provide such an environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...And how is the plan going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>All is going smoothly. Though an unexpected nuisance did arise partway through...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A nuisance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Umm, a minor internal conflict, I guess? We of the Infinite Serpent are not a monolith, by any means. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...If there is no hindrance to the plan, then let's not delve into the matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No need to worry about that! The tower repairs and the Cursed Beast's awakening are complete. What's left, as planned—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>—is just to capture the Cursed Beast alive. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Gah, this has become quite bothersome...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I have to help Adaleigh and the others before it's too late...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Damn it, open this door! We didn't awaken the Cursed Beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It seems that we're somewhere in the vicinity of the port... Nyx, how goes it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...It's no good. I can't communicate with Mira. There might be something in place that inhibits magil here. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...Spiritbonding doesn't work either. The voice of Sephiron is very faint here... This must be how it feels to have magil inhibited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We should assume that our hand is being read.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>In that case, the fact that they separated us by gender for imprisonment was likely not simply out of consideration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I don't understand that part, but one thing has become clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We should likely assume that the city mayor is in league with Icona.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If that's true, then what about Minario...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...Break me out of here? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The recommendation that came from the mayor just a bit ago was consistently directed at us—in other words, Adaleigh and his group.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Based on the phrasing of it, it seems likely that they haven't realized that you're here with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Now I get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Be that as it may...having come this far, shouldn't we be sticking together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's exactly why I want to ask this of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I want you to somehow escape from here and get in contact with the mayor to inform him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Inform my father...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Let him know that we have no hostile intentions, and that our objective is simply to rescue the people of this region from the threat of the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>In which case, even if you're able to reach the mayor without a hitch, our vindication isn't necessarily...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>He won't get it. And Minario might get arrested on the spot. At best, it would just buy us a little time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Buy us time...? What do you mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>They're preparing a technique for controlling the Cursed Beast, or perhaps—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>So that's it... Now that you mention it, that woman was saying so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That she wanted to study Emmel—no, the Vessel of Purification...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>This was my mistake...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I had thought that a Cursed Beast couldn't be anything other than a threat to the people of a region, a calamity to be feared and, if possible, exterminated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I never considered for a single instant that there might be people like Icona who would think to use a Cursed Beast for their benefit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...The very idea of harnessing the power of nature has been the norm throughout human history. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>From river management and land reclamation to agriculture and metallurgy, we have repurposed the blessings of nature as we desired and improved our lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>And so we should do the same with Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>At the very least, that must be how Icona sees it. She intimated as much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It's a prideful thought, to me anyway. Well actually I'm not sure we have any right to say so, given that we're trying to take down the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>If they fail to control it, then everything will lapse into sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Just how confident could they be, living together with a bomb like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...We have to stop them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Adaleigh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>No matter how skilled Icona is, there's no way anyone could control a Cursed Beast without paying a price for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...Icona is not the type of engineer to hesitate making a sacrifice she deems necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>She's even discarded her own body without batting an eyelid when she thought it was necessary. And I respected her nonetheless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But if that sacrifice—if it threatens the lives of the people of this region, then I... I cannot abandon them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>That's why we need to stop Icona. We have to before this region—our homeland—is beyond saving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Besides, we have to help Emmel! We have to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Ah, Adaleigh is right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Um, while we're at it, Mira too...right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>If we continue to stand by doing nothing, then Emmel might be put in danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Also, I'm concerned about the movements of Belphegor since being awakened by Icona.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We can't sit around anymore. We have to escape from here somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>But practically speaking, what will we do? We've been divided up and our weapons were confiscated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>On top of that, Nyx's magic and our Spiritbonding is being blocked, and moreover—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...That's right, let's try it out—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>"Gate within me, please answer this call—"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Gahh?! Could you hang on a sec?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>ahhh—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>(Did I just fail to control a new technique...? I don't want to think so, but this feeling is exactly like...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>WARNING. WARNING. AN IMPACT EXCEEDING THE CONTROL VALUE HAS BEEN DETECTED WITHIN THE FACILITY. POSSIBLY AN ACT OF TERRORISM. I REPEAT—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>This is bad, it sounds like the guards are onto us...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Nimul! How much longer are you going to pull stuff like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>ahhhh I'm sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>At this point it can't be helped—let's go retrieve our equipment and rescue Emmel and the others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>RETURN TO YOUR CELLS. LEAVING THE PREMISES IS PROHIBITED. RETURN TO YOUR CELLS. LEAVING THE PREMISES IS PROHIBITED. RETUR—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Tch... And we're unable to use weapons or Spiritbonding—what is this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I'm sorry! I'll provide as much cover as possible from my side! Try to make it through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Nyx, are you still unable to communicate with Mira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Let me try... Nope, nothing. I can't get through, but I've found signs of Mira's magil. They're to the north-west...in the building on the other side!  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>If the facility is designed like this then... This way! I think it's this way! C'mon everyone!</td>
</tr>
