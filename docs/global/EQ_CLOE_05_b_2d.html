<td>001</td>
<td>The Crown's Guard?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. Until the Blue Flame Guard is back in operation again, we, the Scarlet Flame Guard, will pick up the slack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>However, as things stand, both Captain Vettel and Nina bear incredibly heavy responsibilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This is why I think that we should form the Crown's Guard, and parcel out the duties between us. It is my hope that this will decrease their workloads a little bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I see. Sounds good to me. What do you think, Vettel? Nina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm all for it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Keep in mind that if you were to hesitate on the battlefield, it could lead to the death of a Crown's Guard. Are you capable of maintaining an unshakable will, as Gerald and Nina have exemplified?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well, all right, then. We'll present this idea before the king and the captain of the Blue Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Wratharis' movements are becoming more and more threatening, so I've been thinking for a while now that we need to take action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What has become of Wratharis' army?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>After you drove back the main troops, the soldiers who were garrisoned at the border also retreated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Whether it was truly a distraction, or whether it had some other purpose, is unclear at this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I had Victor investigate, just to be sure. The citizens are still a bit uneasy, and probably will be for a while yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I pledge, here and now, to devote myself to the Scarlet Flame Guard and to work to the benefit of the proud nation of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I will not waver again. I will not lose my sense of justice again. This, I swear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You have a good look in your eyes. What changed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I remembered the justice that I adhere to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I leave the matter of the Crown's Guard to you. I'll take my leave now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>They just keep growing, don't they? Oh, to be young again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What are you talking like an old man for? You've still got a heck of a lot of work before you! Should I prescribe you some medicine, grandpa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No, I think I'll get by. That aside... Nina, I've been meaning to ask you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes...? Oh, this? This is my stuffed animal, Fluffy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Look at how big it's gotten! Eheheh... It's so cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Y-yeah. I think it's, uh...unique.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Eheheheheh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm really happy that Chloe is feeling better. I'll have to work even harder now, to keep up with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm going to keep moving forward, putting one foot in front of the other. That's what Fluffy here is for, to serve as the proof of my determination!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's almost done, I think. I have to make sure not to waste any more fur, so that I can make it the cutest it can possibly be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Chloe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What is it, Nina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Is your heart a little more settled now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Not yet. Regardless, I must protect the world that she fought for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If she ever returns to this world, I want it be a peaceful one that will welcome her back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You really are strong, Chloe. I hope we can continue working together like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I didn't mean to worry you. I'm all right now, really. As a fellow member of the Scarlet Flame Guard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I swear that I will support both you and Captain Vettel from now on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Thank you! Let's do our best together, Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wow! A hug! You're so warm! Eheheheh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Let's work hard together, Nina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Watch over me, Kanon...and know this:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The scarlet flame in my heart will never go out again!</td>
