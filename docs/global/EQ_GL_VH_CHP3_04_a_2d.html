<td>Back in the abandoned warehouse, a palpable silence falls over the group like a heavy blanket.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Tension stretches taut between them, thick enough to be cut with a knife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I see. You are certain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's what I propose. It's really our only option at this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We need to get out of Slothstein entirely. Our closest destination would be to Lustberg in the east.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If we can make it past the border, we should be able to seek out Professor Minerva.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Blair's right. Her insight and advice will be welcome additions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's been a while since I had these troubling visions of my past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It doesn't bode well at all, considering all of them are related to the Constructs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But—What about Rox? And Emrys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You can't seriously suggest leaving them to their fates here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We can't do much more. It's been 24 hours since Morrigan's arrival, and we've been scouting as much as we could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Either they are not in this area, or they've been...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Don't say it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If I were there just a moment earlier, I could've—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're letting emotion cloud your senses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Think, Siegfried. Would Roxanne want you rotting in a cell adjacent to hers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...I'm going outside to clear my head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>*sigh*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This entire situation has been hard on all of us. I don't blame him for feeling powerless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm the last person who saw Rox, after all...and I left her there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You did what you could, Miss Blair. Eira is out of their clutches thanks to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Now, I too must take my leave. Lord Zheng Yi must know of these developments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>He will see to it that you receive as much aid as he can provide. I'll send word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Thank you for everything you've done for us, Shion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You're sure you'll be fine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Nothing I'm unfamiliar with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Do take care. And on the off chance Miss Roxanne returns...I shall be glad to bring her a bottle of my house's finest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Heavens know she needs it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I guess we'd better prepare for the journey. It's going to be pretty rough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Eira's never had to travel so much before. I worry for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Soren, a moment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Sure... What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What do you...make of Morrigan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Make?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I wonder what she intends to do...or who she is, for that matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I know this isn't the time to question someone who essentially saved Eira, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If it helps, I don't feel like she'll do Eira any harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Her aura makes me a little uneasy, I guess. But it's only strange, not hostile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If you say so, Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(To run or to hide. Neither is an easy path...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Poor child. Would that you knew what was in store for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>But with such stalwart guardians by your side... Perhaps all will be well, in due time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Sleep well. You have quite a journey ahead...</td>
