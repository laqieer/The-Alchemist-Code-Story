<tr>

<td>Ever since I was young, I've traveled a lot while training as a blacksmith, looking for material for weapons and such...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I've encountered dangerous situations on numerous occasions. Thus, I don't sleep very deeply when sleeping outdoors.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>In any case...the fact that you're afraid to sleep must mean that your fear of death is quite deeply rooted in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>I'm afraid that, if I were to sleep, I may not be able to wake up in the morning.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>I wake up somewhat disheartened thinking to myself, "It looks I survived today as well." I realize it's something of a contradiction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Hmm. By the way, what about your parents?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>They're not around anymore. That is...there were killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>I see. You wouldn't happen to be a survivor of the Sephira folk, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>...?! U-um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you if you are. I'm just curious.<br><br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>Y-yes. The blood of Sephira runs through my veins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>I see. I've heard stories of them. Long ago, there were people here who worshiped the giant green tree of Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>They were prosperous both in their wisdom and their technological advancements. Viewing them as a source of danger, the Gluttony army destroyed them...I think that was how the story went.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>Yes. I've heard about it as well. It happened before I was born...thus, I've only heard the stories from my mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Hmm. From what I've heard, the invasion of the Gluttony army was an appalling one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Even after the tree of Sephiron had gone extinct, the people of Sephira were driven off time and time again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>It's no wonder that you're afraid of death. I'm sure you've seen more than your fair share in this life already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>I agree, but it's not just that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>The Tree of Sephiron gave us wisdom. It was our cornerstone-we, the people of Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>However, it is now lost to us. My people have no choice but to idly perish away. We will die...and vanish from the face of this earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>I see. That being said, I wonder if it is truly death that you're afraid of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Due to my line of work, I've associated with many a knight and warrior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Amongst them, there are those who obsess over the way they will die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>The way they will die...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Yep. They wish to die in a spectacular and graceful way. As for myself, I'm a blacksmith. I couldn't care less about the way I die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>I'm far more focused on what I can create while I'm still alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Until the moment I die, I want to listen to the voice of the iron that I strike, weld, and sharpen! That is my way of living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Those that focus on how they die and I who focus on how I live...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Actually, we're not that different. Do you know what I mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>The way one dies is determined by the way they live. You know, Uzuma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Maybe what you're really afraid of is being alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Or better put...you're so afraid of dying that you've become scared of living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>That's how it appears to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>Scared of...living?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Are you...really alive right now? Or are you dead even as you live?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Hah...hyahahah! All jokes aside, these are just the foolish reprimands of an old fart! Forget about what I said!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>Ahh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Hm? What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>Ack. Ku Yogi! Soon...you're going to...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>...Hey. What are you lot doing sneaking about again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>...So you've detected us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hooded Man</td>
<td>We don't want to do anything unnecessary. All we need is you, Uzuma...you alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hooded Man</td>
<td>If you come with us, we'll leave peacefully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/uzum.png" alt="Uzuma" height="128"><br>Uzuma</td>
<td>Ugh...n-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Jeez. You're a persistent bunch, aren't you? The young lady here doesn't want to go with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>I don't want to do anything unnecessary either. If you get my drift then you'd best clear off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hooded Man</td>
<td>I guess negotiations are off then. Kill them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yogi</td>
<td>Miuna!</td>
