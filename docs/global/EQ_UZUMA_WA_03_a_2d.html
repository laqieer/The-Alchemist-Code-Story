<td>Hmm. Who would've thought there'd be a forest in the desert? Oh, there's even a small lake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Long ago, this land was not a desert. This is one of the few remaining remnants. One day, this too will wither away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Perfect. The sun is about to go down. Let's spend the night here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>All right, I'll take on the night watch, so I'm gonna get some rest now. Uff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Fine, fine. Good night, dad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Zzz...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I always imagined an oasis to be some kind of puddle in the middle of the desert...hmmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Miuna...what's the matter? Is there something inside the lake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, there it is! Uff!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh?! What should I do?! She fell into the lake... I-I need to rescue her...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Eeek! A-a fish?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Phew...! Look at this huge catch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh...? Huh? Miuna, what are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What do you mean? I'm catching fish. That way we'll have something to eat for tonight's dinner, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Are we going to eat...dinner?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Of course. If we don't eat we die, right? I'm starving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Come on. What are you staring at? How about you go collect some branches? I'll try and catch a few more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>O-okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It should be cooked soon. Hmm...munch...munch... Yeah! It's perfect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>.... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Are you not gonna eat it? It's going to burn, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh, okay...thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hey. Why are you always so frightened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I understand why you'd be confused if you were suddenly attacked by a bunch of strangers, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We're here with you. You can a be a little more at ease, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>N-no, it's not that....! I'm scared...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yeah, I picked up on that, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No, you don't understand. I'm scared of...death. What I am frightened of is death...itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I have foreseen the death of many people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No, not just the death of others, but I've seen my own death as well. That's why I'm scared of dying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Um...so what you're scared of isn't this situation...but of death itself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That pretty much sums it up. Although, of course, I'm scared of this situation as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But, hey, every living thing dies in the end, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...?! I'm sure you don't understand this fear that I feel, Miuna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...Sorry, but I don't like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I don't understand how you could be so frightened of dying while you're still alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I also don't like...people like you either...Miuna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Fuwaaaah! Mmmm! Ahh...I slept well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh, smells good! Is it fish? All right! I'll have some as well! I'm starving!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Zzz...zzz...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Can't you sleep?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Well, a lot happened today. I'm sure you're feeling pretty overstimulated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...No, it's not that. I've always had trouble sleeping.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Are you scared of sleeping?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh...? Y-yes... I guess you were listening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Sorry. I didn't mean to, but I couldn't help picking up on your conversation with Miuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ever since I was young, I've traveled a lot while training as a blacksmith, looking for material for weapons and such...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I've encountered dangerous situations on numerous occasions. Thus, I don't sleep very deeply when sleeping outdoors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Besides...more than anything, I was born with the sharpest of ears! Hyahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>In any case...the fact that you're afraid to sleep must mean that your fear of death is quite deeply rooted in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I'm afraid that, if I were to sleep, I may not be able to wake up in the morning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Still, I ultimately wake up the next morning having fallen asleep sometime during the night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I wake up somewhat disheartened thinking to myself, "It looks I survived today as well." I realize it's something of a contradiction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hmm. By the way, what about your parents?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>They're not around anymore. That is...there were killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I see. You wouldn't happen to be a survivor of the Sephira folk, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...?! U-um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you if you are. I'm just curious.<br><br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Y-yes. The blood of Sephira runs through my veins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I see. I've heard stories of them. Long ago, there were people here who worshiped the giant green tree of Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>They were prosperous both in their wisdom and their technological advancements. Viewing them as a source of danger, the Gluttony army destroyed them...I think that was how the story went.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Yes. I've heard about it as well. It happened before I was born...thus, I've only heard the stories from my mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hmm. From what I've heard, the invasion of the Gluttony army was an appalling one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Even after the tree of Sephiron had gone extinct, the people of Sephira were driven off time and time again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It's no wonder that you're afraid of death. I'm sure you've seen more than your fair share in this life already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I agree, but it's not just that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>The Tree of Sephiron gave us wisdom. It was our cornerstone-we, the people of Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>However, it is now lost to us. My people have no choice but to idly perish away. We will die...and vanish from the face of this earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I see. That being said, I wonder if it is truly death that you're afraid of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Due to my line of work, I've associated with many a knight and warrior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Amongst them, there are those who obsess over the way they will die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The way they will die...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yep. They wish to die in a spectacular and graceful way. As for myself, I'm a blacksmith. I couldn't care less about the way I die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'm far more focused on what I can create while I'm still alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Until the moment I die, I want to listen to the voice of the iron that I strike, weld, and sharpen! That is my way of living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Those that focus on how they die and I who focus on how I live...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Actually, we're not that different. Do you know what I mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>The way one dies is determined by the way they live. You know, Uzuma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Maybe what you're really afraid of is being alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Or better put...you're so afraid of dying that you've become scared of living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>That's how it appears to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Scared of...living?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Are you...really alive right now? Or are you dead even as you live?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Hah...hyahahah! All jokes aside, these are just the foolish reprimands of an old fart! Forget about what I said!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Ahh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Hm? What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Ack. Ku Yogi! Soon...you're going to...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>...Hey. What are you lot doing sneaking about again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>...So you've detected us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>We don't want to do anything unnecessary. All we need is you, Uzuma...you alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>If you come with us, we'll leave peacefully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Ugh...n-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Jeez. You're a persistent bunch, aren't you? The young lady here doesn't want to go with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I don't want to do anything unnecessary either. If you get my drift then you'd best clear off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I guess negotiations are off then. Kill them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Miuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Gotcha!</td>
</tr>
