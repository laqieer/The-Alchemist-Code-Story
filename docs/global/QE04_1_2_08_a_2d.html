<td>Ack! At this rate, I can't even tell where the Jam are...</td>

<td>Are you okay...?</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Th-thank you! But...why...?!</td>

<td>Why what...?</td>

<td>011</td>
<td>Aren't you from a Tehre faction tribe? Why would you help me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Why? You don't need to be from the same tribe to help somebody who's being attacked, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So that's what's going on...</td>

<td>Huh...?</td>

<tr>

<td>Look. There are numerous individuals who seem to be warriors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Even if they couldn't defeat the Jam, I was wondering why no one at least tried to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're right. What?! Are you saying they didn't help because they're from a different faction?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's nonsense! Isn't saving someone's life a completely different matter from any dispute between tribes?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It looks like that's not the case here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's how serious the divisiveness has become.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's terrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I don't want to admit it...but this is the current reality of Saga.</td>
