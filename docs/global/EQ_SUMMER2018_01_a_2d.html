<td>Yay! The sea! Hey, Alma! Rebecca! Look! It's the sea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ah, get a lungful of that salty, sea breeze!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Liz, you are getting way too excited about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh? Aren't you excited, Rebecca? You couldn't wait to get here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>A-as if! I've come to the beach with my family more times than I can count.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh... You've been on tenterhooks ever since we found out about the Seaside Class, but you just can't be honest about that, can you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wha—?! D-don't act like you're any different! You even practiced swimming in preparation for today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>W-well, I was looking forward to it! But then I lost too much fat on my diet, and now I can't float anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm not good at swimming to begin with, and just when I was starting to get the hang of it... I should have known that stupid diet would backfire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I-I'll teach you how to swim, if it comes to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hey, come on, you two! Hurry up and get in the water already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh, Liz... Wait, when did she inflate the floaties and the beach ball? That was fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Liz isn't the only one getting excited. The other girls are getting into it, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We don't get the chance to go to the beach much in Lustburg, so come on, let's—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Girls! What are you frolicking about for?! The Seaside Class is not a vacation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What?! It isn't?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Of course not! The Seaside Class is simply an extension of your regular lessons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Now, let us begin our exercise for today and practice vanquishing monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No way! That's what we always do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's right! I agree with Liz!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It is by proving that you are capable of exercising your powers in an unfamiliar environment that you will come to be recognized as a first rate witch. This is a traditional extracurricular activity of the Venus School of Magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I mean, that's probably true, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The team that scores the lowest will have one item removed from their barbecue dinner tonight! Am I clear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Whaaaaat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Haaaa... I thought this might happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You knew about this, Alma?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Kinda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I've heard that monsters used to appear here a lot—especially in the summer. At one point, tourists stopped coming here altogether.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Someone from the school had their eye on this place, and offered to clear out the monsters in exchange for being able to reserve the whole beach for cheap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>By calling it an "extracurricular activity," she can make the students work extra hard. Our Headmistress sure is a crafty one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What?! I can't believe that they arranged this Seaside Class for such a stupid reason as that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I thought we'd be able to relax today, so I brought my own parasol and everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well...Liz looks like she's into it, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>N-no way! I can't believe she'd deprive us of food! Alma! Rebecca! What should we do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What should we do? Liz, she's only going to take one item of food. You can't really call that depriving us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You're one to talk. You were so excited about a barbecue dinner that you marked that page of the guidebook with a sticky note.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>H-hey! You should know it's terrible manners to look at people's things without their permission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's my first time ever having a barbecue with my friends! I don't want to miss out on a single piece!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh, Liz...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Friendship and gluttony... What a wonderful combination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This barbecue will be something that I remember for the rest of my life! I can't let even a single piece slip through my clutches! So we have to win, no matter what...but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Everyone looks so fired up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well, everybody wants to enjoy all the fresh seafood. At this rate, we might end up in last place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Nnnngghhh... Not my precious barbecue!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Come on! Don't make that face! No team that I am a part of could ever finish last!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'll never get sick of watching those two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Having said that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Gwwwaaaaarrrrrggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Unnngghhh... It's too hot. I'm not at my best. How come the monsters have so much energy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'm sure that any monsters inhabiting this area have built up some resistance to heat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>My brain's gonna overheat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Whereas, we were born and raised in the wintry land of Lustburg. This might be more difficult than we thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>All we can do is our best. I'm not sure Liz will recover if we lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>We must use our heads. Yes... Let's aim for the monsters closest to the sea! They seem to gather there in number, and we can cut off their escape route!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Um, Rebecca? Like I said before, I can't float right now, so the shore is kinda dangerous for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Ah! Over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Let's take down the monsters by the beach! Quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I'm not letting you take away my food!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Oh dear, this isn't going well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Not going well?! It's going terribly! We're headed straight for last place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>L-last place?! No way! Not my precious seafood! All right, now that it's come to this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Please! I need some beach bodies! Someone, anyone! Help us! Lend us your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Huh. They're not really what I expected. I mean, they're wearing swimsuits, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I know what you mean. I thought someone more, er, mermaid-like would appear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I'm not sure if there are any mermaid-like Phantoms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>W-well! You never know! They might be super great swimmers! Right, guys?! We need your help taking down the—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Thanks! I'm counting on—wait, what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Hmmm... Sorry, I don't really feel like getting wet right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I would prefer to avoid strenuous exercise in this heat. I may be a Phantom, but my body was never particularly strong to begin with, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Th-they're not gonna help us! What should we do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You're asking me? You're the one who summoned them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I can't believe it! I've never been turned down like this before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>It is a bit strange. You said that you wanted someone who is good at swimming to lend us their strength. Since this lot showed up, I would've thought they'd be happy to help us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Th-that's right! Why did you come here, anyway?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Is it even possible for Phantoms to disobey the person who summoned them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Grrrraaaaarrrrgggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Eeeeeek! A monster! It's coming this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It looks like our plan to trap them up against the sea got turned around on us! Let's show them who's boss!</td>
</tr>
