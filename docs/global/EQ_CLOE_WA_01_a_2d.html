<td>Commander Chloe, about today's patrol...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Pl-please. I still haven't fully earned the title of Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But it was thanks to you, Commander Chloe, that our squadron was awarded a medal of honor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Now that the whole country refers to you as Commander Chloe, we should call you the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But it's not through my strength, but all of yours that we received the medal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm honored to be in this squadron. I believe that you are the best commander in this country right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No, I still have a lot to learn. I'm doing my best to become a knight worthy of being a squadron commander, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I still have a long way to go before being referred to as Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I see. Well then, shall I continue to call you Commander Chloe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes. Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Rookie! Have you finished your report?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>My apologies! Today's patrol will head south of the forest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Very well. Begin preparations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Understood! Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Commander Chloe, are you still not used to being called Captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No. After all, the title Captain should be reserved for such fine knights as Captain Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I've still got a long way to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I would disagree. You're a fine knight and commander, Commander Chloe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I hope so, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Your humility is part of your reputation. I won't say anything further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Thank you. Hearing that from a veteran knight like you makes me feel a little more confident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well then, Commander, it seems that the preparation is completed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes. Let's go! Knights, advance!</td>
