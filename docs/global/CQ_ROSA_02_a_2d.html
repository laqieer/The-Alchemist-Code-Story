<td>What are you playing at?! Why do I need to get involved in your problems?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's inevitable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I broke your weapon so it was destined to be this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Seriously? You're like a brat throwing a tantrum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If it matters to you so much then how about you go ahead and apologize to my weapon that you broke?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What? Why should I apologize?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Sigh... Fine. In that case, give me your prey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wh-what are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Just hurry up and give it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Whaaaat?! You broke it?! How could you, you scum?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yeah, I broke it. We're even now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>How could you? At this rate, the evil sealed within the scythe and the King of Chaos will be unleashed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Th-this world will end! And it'll all be your fault!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, that's unfortunate. That being said, half of it will be your fault. How are you going to take responsibility?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What?! Augh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hey, you two...what are you doing there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh? Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I heard there was a talented blacksmith here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's you, isn't it? Will you forge a weapon for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Can you not see the number of troops I have standing behind me? Do you think you have an option?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I have no intention of forging a weapon for someone I know nothing about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I see. In that case...burn it all down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You...! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I have no resentment towards you, but you'll now be eliminated. I cannot afford to have others of power obtaining your weapons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hold on a second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I was already in talks with him. Who do you think you are to disrupt my negotiations?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hey. Shut up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No. I will not shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>As one who loves weapons, I cannot allow such one-sided actions to go overlooked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>One-sided, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Those are fine words, young lady. However, this is no place for a child. Shut your mouth and look the other way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>How spiteful...and foolish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's nauseating to see a noble of similar rank to myself engaging in such tyranny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I don't know where you claim to be from, but you are not qualified to stand above anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well, well... It appears I have an unwelcoming witness present here. In that case, you'll have to die as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Enough of this nonsense. You are the one who will die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'll have you eat your own words!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hey, wait! You're completely unarmed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Tsk... Use this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Is this...a scythe?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I made it as a hobby, but you should be able to wield it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>So, you make things like this as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I was going through a phase. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Heheh. Fine then. I'll show you how terrifying I am!</td>
