<td>Hyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Agh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I won't kill you. There's a mountain full of questions that you'll have to answer for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Heh... You're not getting anything from me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What?! He's biting on poison!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So he'd rather kill himself than give up information. Quite thorough, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>From the timing of it, I guess there's little doubt he was an assassin sent by the forces who are after the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well, that's the only probable explanation. That being said, I didn't expect them to act so quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ironically, they've confirmed the value of the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So...it's a spirit gem containing a massive amount of Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>According to the reports from our investigative unit, the amount of Alchemia included in the Mikaboshi is supposedly comparable to that of a Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I see. That's hard to believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If something with that much power were to fall into the hands of someone who already possess a Sacred Stone...the equilibrium of this world will collapse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You did well to report this. You have my gratitude. Go now and rest your body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I don't want to say this, but if only Captain Cadanova were here now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Heheh. True. I'm sure he would've done a much better job of planning this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm sorry. Due to my lack of experience...you might have to get your hands dirty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. I'm not so pure as to worry about a little dirty work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Besides...you truly did well. I never once felt you were lacking in experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You are too kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well then...we're up against time. We need to move out as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Our aim is to destroy the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Are you going to change strategies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes. This may seem to overturn my earlier order, but I want you to summon all the regiments in order to change our strategy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Captain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I heard what is going on, Lord Commander. It appears something strange is in the works.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>As you know, I am here empty-handed. Please give me a mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No matter how strong the opponent, I promise I will defeat them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No..your orders remain the same. Stay put.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What do you mean?! Are you trying to say that you don't believe in my abilities? In that case, I'll make you recall them right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Calm down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What I mean is that your strength is inconsequential to this strategy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Please don't give me such a blatant excuse. Didn't you say to gather all Paladins and regroup?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>This is an order. You are not needed this time. Stay back. Insubordination will not be tolerated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Very...well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Heh. It doesn't go the way it used to with Cadanova. I guess I still have a lot to learn.</td>
