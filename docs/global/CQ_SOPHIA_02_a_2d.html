<td>Sophia! Are you hurt? Honestly... Please... Putting yourself in harm's way is super unacceptable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Soleil, sorry for worrying you. I'll go home for today. Let's have tea together next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh... Yes, I understand. Please be careful on your way home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Thank you. You too...Soleil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yawn... Oh? Is it still this early? I've woken up at an odd hour.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmm... I can't seem to fall back to sleep. Maybe I'll try my hand at some divination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh? No...! This time it's Soleil that's in danger...? I need to go to her right away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I wonder if she's at her house. Oh, I hope I can get there in time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>There's a light coming from the window! It seems like Soleil is safe. What a relief...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hey, Muncle? Do you think Sophia will come visit me again? I wonder if I acted out of turn today...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>When I watch Sophia, she reminds me so much of Luru... I can't help myself from wanting to look after her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(Heheh. She's talking about Luruna again. Soleil told me about her the first time we met. I hope I can meet her someday.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sophia, do you come to this town often?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes. As long as I hide my ears, I can move about the town safely without anyone knowing my identity...although the people of my village are against it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm sure they're all worried about you. I have a younger sister too, so I can empathize with them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>In order to protect ourselves and avoid danger, we live tucked away together in our hidden village, avoiding contact with humans and other races.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But I want to absorb and learn more and more about what life has to offer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're such an eager student!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Heheh. This time that I'm spending with you eating lunch in this town is another precious moment that I'm learning a lot from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I enjoy spending time with you too, Sophia! I think I can assist you in your studies! You can rely on me as if I were your older sister!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ah-hahah. Actually, I'm older than Soleil...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...Well, well. We meet again, little elf missy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You're the men from this afternoon! What're you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well, our boss was none too happy when we came back empty-handed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We were gonna capture the little therapist and use her to bait you, but... Your being here makes everything a lot simpler!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You were going to kidnap Soleil for such a stupid reason? I see... So, you really haven't learned anything from our fight earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...All right then. I guess I'll show you...the true strength of my race!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Sophia! What're you doing here at this hour? It's a little late for tea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Soleil, please, go back inside the house!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You caused quite a lot of problems for us this afternoon, little therapist!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh! You guys again! Are you still chasing after Sophia! Erghhh! That's super unacceptable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>All right, this time we'd better catch them! Take 'em down, boys!</td>
