<td>Lord Ryle, please wake up! You still have much work left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Let me sleep a little longer. I suffer from a disease that renders me unable to work unless I've taken a nap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That's always the excuse you use to sleep. You're our leader, so please be more responsible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's not like I chose to be the leader. You guys handle it on your own. Good night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Enough, Lord Ryle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Take this to the harbor and everything will sort itself out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This document? Understood! I shall go now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Finally, I get to sleep in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Lord Ryle, you have a guest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I can't even take a nap in peace. Guards, you handle whoever is there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well...the thing is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm just gonna step in here! You're Ryle the leader, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And if I am? As you can see, I'm busy taking a nap over here. Notify the guards about any business you may have with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I am Ramses, Successor of the Sun! I am a man who is entitled to speak with the top brass around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, you're a real piece of work, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I've heard the trade route here is a vast one, far larger than the regular guilds. Thus, I want you to procure works of art for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Why are you telling me about this? Go ask someone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm talking about a large quantity of items. I've made a list of the artworks that I want. Having heard of how resourceful you are, I am making the request to you personally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...! This is way too much. There's no way to procure all of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Isn't your power the ability to make an impossible request such as this possible? I will, of course, pay a considerable amount of money!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's not about the money...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You have a deadline of two weeks. Just procure as much as you can! Please, do your best for my sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(I'd wish he'd actually listen to what I'm saying. Well, I guess that's the way that rich people are. They're an entitled bunch.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(He's the typical type of guy who thinks that money can solve everything.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(On top of that, even though I want to turn down his offer...it may cause quite a lot of problems.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's amazing! I can't believe you procured such a large trade deal! You truly are impressive, Lord Ryle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(Of course, that's how they'd see it. I played zero part in obtaining this trade deal.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'll give you instructions. Try to handle this as best as you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Understood! We'll spread out and handle this in groups!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(Whew. I just hope this doesn't turn into a troublesome affair.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh well. It can't be helped. I guess I'll do some work.</td>
