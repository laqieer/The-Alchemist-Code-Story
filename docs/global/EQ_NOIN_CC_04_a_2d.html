<td>What, you guys didn't believe in me?</td>

<tr>
<td>Lost Blue Citizen A</td>
<td>Heh. You're like the second coming of Othima, the hero of Lost Blue. It'll be a miracle if we make it to the top.</td>

<td>But, look!</td>

<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>I can't get through. There's some kind of wall in the way. The stairs stop part of the way up.</td>

<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Are the floors ahead not materialized?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Remember what Nihil said? We need vast alchemical energy to get the floors to materialize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>He said the floors below us were formed by people that came before us spending years channeling energy into the tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Vast alchemical energy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>We'll need something like a Philosopher's Stone or one of the Sacred Stones the seven kingdoms of Babel own. Maybe even what little Alchemia that flows within people would help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Oh, come on. National treasures like the Sacred Stones or some Philosopher's stone aren't just gonna fall from the sky.</td>

<tr>

<td>How many times have you transformed today?</td>

<tr>

<tr>

<tr>

<td>No one will get in our way here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Not this again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lost Blue Citizen A</td>
<td>Don't you think this tower is a perfect grave stone for ya, King of Lost Blue?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lost Blue Citizen B</td>
<td>A worn out Dead Nine and a brat that can't use her Beast Form anymore. We won't get another chance like this!</td>
</tr>

<td>Aw, crap. Reinforcements?!</td>

<tr>

<td>Let's just kill Dead Nine and get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You're not gonna leave me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>Who else is going to wipe up my puke?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Is that all I'm good for to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>If I puke up nine beers worth of blood, you'll take care of me, won't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rat-Killer</td>
<td>I'm more surprised that you haven't left me yet, to be honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>I just don't want to be some punk that can't follow his own rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dead Nine</td>
<td>Besides, I love the way you fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
