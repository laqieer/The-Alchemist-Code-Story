<td>Mystic Tower Veda</td>

<td>Grrraaaaaaaahhrrrr!</td>

<td>Tch! I've already lost count!</td>

<td>006</td>
<td>We're on the hundredth floor, Dead Nine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It all looks the same to me.</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You gotta at least keep count, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I hate math.</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hehehehe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Holy crap. I can't believe we made it this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I didn't think there would be anybody besides Nihil who could fight like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What, you guys didn't believe in me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Heh. You're like the second coming of Othima, the hero of Lost Blue. It'll be a miracle if we make it to the top.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I have no intention of being a hero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Dead Nine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ugh... Looks like there's still a ways to go above the 100th floor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But, look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I can't get through. There's some kind of wall in the way. The stairs stop part of the way up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Are the floors ahead not materialized?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Remember what Nihil said? We need vast alchemical energy to get the floors to materialize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>He said the floors below us were formed by people that came before us spending years channeling energy into the tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Vast alchemical energy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We'll need something like a Philosopher's Stone or one of the Sacred Stones the seven kingdoms of Babel own. Maybe even what little Alchemia that flows within people would help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh, come on. National treasures like the Sacred Stones or some Philosopher's stone aren't just gonna fall from the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But we have to...!</td>

<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>A couple of steps materializing isn't gonna matter. Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Urk...! Blegck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>How many times have you transformed today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But...but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We can make it this far. Isn't it enough we figured that much out for now? We don't have to rush this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Still, I... I don't want to give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So this is it, Dead Nine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We're tired. Let's go back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Tired? Did he say he's tired? Hahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I bet he is. They've been fighting for us this whole time! Heh, heh, heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No one will get in our way here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Not this again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Don't you think this tower is a perfect grave stone for ya, King of Lost Blue?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>A worn out Dead Nine and a brat that can't use her Beast Form anymore. We won't get another chance like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Aw, crap. Reinforcements?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Heh. This ain't good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Let's just kill Dead Nine and get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You're not gonna leave me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Who else is going to wipe up my puke?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Is that all I'm good for to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>If I puke up nine beers worth of blood, you'll take care of me, won't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I'm more surprised that you haven't left me yet, to be honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I just don't want to be some punk that can't follow his own rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Besides, I love the way you fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>R-really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That's why I can trust you.</td>
