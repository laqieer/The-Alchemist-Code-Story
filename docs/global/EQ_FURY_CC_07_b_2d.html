<td>If I could make one request...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Is this the part where you beg me to spare you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Button is a kind girl. She's...liable to break at some point, even without your interference.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The shrine maiden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Your purpose is to assassinate your target, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If I wait for her to break, I won't get paid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I want her to live, even if it means that she will break someday. Even after she breaks, I want her to go on living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So if you try to kill Button now, you'll have to go through me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're asking me to just let her go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It'd be nice if you could watch over her for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What if she doesn't break?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Good point. I think...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I think she'll end up putting a spell on the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I like the sound of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'd like to see this world get turned upside down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The more one lives, the closer death creeps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Out of the darkness we come, and into the darkness we tread. At some point in our life, we merely turn around and head back the way we came. Yet somehow, humans have forgotten this simple truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I suppose that is why they cling so desperately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Desperately and pathetically to that which makes them who they are—whatever that thing may be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What path exists, then, for those who would offer up that crucial something in exchange for power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I...do not know. Where, oh where, do they go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Knowing that the more one lives, the closer death creeps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It sounds like rain to me now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>All the death throes, the screams, the clang of swords clashing, the cacophony of war...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The wind that whistled on that day, the rush of the river, the sunlight dappled through the trees, the sights of the foreign lands, the paths, the mountains, the trees, the mornings, the days, and the nights...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Even death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>All of the tragedies I cannot forget. All of these memories surge in a constant stream in my mind—yet to me, this feels akin to the incessant dripping of early-summer rain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's all just noise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Füry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Do you hate me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes...a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Füry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's time for work. Help me tend the store for once, won't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Sure. I'd be happy to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Füry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Do you think, um... Could I get a reading?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes. Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Füry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Are you ignoring me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Oh, yes. I was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>May I get a reading?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Let me see... Good fortune awaits you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You just made that up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I made it up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Harmony. An absence of hate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>A hatred that grows too great will crush the spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You gave me a new family. A new home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It seems that sometimes our prayers are granted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>My mind was groaning under the weight of my past...until you offered to accompany me into the future of Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That is why despite the fact I cannot see the sky right now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Just say the magic words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. Everything is fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>These are the magic words. A spell to the make the pain go away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Please give light...to the children of Lost Blue...who are filled with...potential...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>We...live in a land that the sun does not reach... We must give the oppressed people...the same rights...that those on the land above have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Our...sky...in...Lo...Lost...Blue...!!! Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>All you need to do is say the magic words. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. Everything is fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Look, Seida! Those tens of thousands of soldiers have disappeared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>All you need to do is say the magic words. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. Everything is fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>All the streets and buildings that had collapsed have been restored...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Just say the magic words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Welcome back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I've been looking for you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Did you break the curse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>The...curse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Y'know, the one you put on yourself. All that stuff about living up to your name—blaming yourself for everything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>It still haunts me. I lost to this curse of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Haha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Ikasa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You don't need to apologize. I thought that was a pretty good joke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>No, I... I wasn't apologizing for what I just said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I wanted to apologize for...cursing you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What're you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>At a time when no one would have anything to do with me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You were the first person who actually reached out and helped me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>"We're family, aren't we?" Remember when you told me that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I'm happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I can't believe I...never realized...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Because I got to be with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I never realized...until just now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>That my world was peaceful all along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I can hear the rain in the distance, pounding endlessly away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>First, to the horizon that stretches out as far as the eye can see. Second, to the lands you've been dreaming of all your life. Third, back to your peaceful homeland fading into the distance behind you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Fourth, to the side of your faithful friend and fellow dreamer. Fifth, to the sky above you. What do you see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Do you want my honest answer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Give it to me straight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>It's horrible! Stormy skies, as far as the eye can see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Ha! Then this journey is proceeding exactly as expected!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>She is my umbrella.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>As we continue our journey through the rain, I press my open palm to yours and link our fingers together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>The path we tread is treacherous and paved with loss. The itinerary we have planned is very likely wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Still, with those magic words, we can smile through our pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>The rain is still pounding away...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>But I don't care how loud it is, as long as I can still hear your voice.</td>
</tr>
