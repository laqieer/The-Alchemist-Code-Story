<td>What is there to discuss? Northern Pride demands Alchemia. If we deliver them the remnants of the Sephira, everything will be settled!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>They will not trade us the food or water we need if we do not! We are wasting our time! Just hand the Sephira over to them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I can understand your frustration, but if we were to just give the Sephira away, where would we stand if Northern Pride were to make demands again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Our resources will eventually be depleted. For the sake of this desert's future, we must discuss our next—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We need to prioritize the present! The future will only come if we survive this current predicament! Just hand them over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Surely even you have not been poisoned by the delusions of that man as well? Be reasonable! There is no way we can bring greenery into this desert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Phew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Busy as usual, Nefertiti? It has been some time since we last spoke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ankh? What an unexpected pleasure. What are you doing here? Come to check up on me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I had some duties nearby, so I decided to drop by and say hello. Not much has changed, has it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I suppose I should not be surprised that the Conservative Party still has such a voice in the court. They seem very eager about expelling the Sephira from this country. What are you going to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, you seem to have an opinion on the matter. What do you think should be done?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>How the hell is that my problem? Ain't it your job to come up with something? I'm not a frickin' noble anymore. You know that, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My, my. Aren't we snappy? Have you not had your tea yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>M-my apologies... I simply mean to point out that this issue must be resolved quickly. Our livelihoods are on the line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>In light of that, I strongly recommend that the Conservative Party not be allowed take the wheel on this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It would be rotten and, frankly, despicable to banish Sephira survivors from our lands. I trust you will make the right choice, Nefertiti.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I have not forgotten who I am, even if you perhaps have, Ankh. I am not unaware that I must come to a decision at some point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Protecting someone requires more than simply hiding them away. Isn't that right, Hawk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Come one, come all! We've got fresh fruit, just in! Limited time offer! Get 'em before they're gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Envylian ceramics! Rarest and finest of items, all of 'em! You there, how 'bout it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Noodles made of...wheat?! This is delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Such delicacies would never have been found in Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Another round, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Excuse me. Have there been any odd rumors recently? For example, about creatures of legend from Saga appearing out of sandstorms, etc.?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Uh... No? I haven't heard of anything like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh, okay. Thank you! I can't lose heart over such a small disappointment. I'll find the beast I'm looking for, no matter what it takes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Whoa, watch where you're going, little lady. Where'd you come from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Me? I'm not "Little Lady"! I'm Zofia! I'm hungry! Food! Need food!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Quit draggin' me around. I have to wait for someone here. Where're your parents?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Par...Parents?! A renting pear?! Hahaha! I dunno! Need food! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You're hungry? Fine, sure, just hold on a sec. Man, I hope Carla's doin' all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hey, I said quit pullin' me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>If I've said it once, I've said it a million times: We have to unite the Desert Zone as a single country. That would make governance infinitely simpler!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>With public order the way it is, nobody but ruffians are sticking around. Think of the kids who have to grow up in such an environment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I understand where you're coming from, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You don't understand! That's the problem! You haven't taken any action to fix the situation! You're being—uh, what's the word? Oh yeah, negligent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Carla, you know the Desert Zone was once a country of its own, don't you? During that time, the nobility held all the power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Back then, conflict broke out constantly among the nobles who were scrabbling for power, causing other countries to feel threatened by our presence. This lead to the eventual dismantling of our entire government.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>As a country, we may be able to facilitate bringing peace within our borders, but at the same time, it could lead to creating enemies abroad. That would not be any better for the children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And that is more important to you than getting rid of the dangers within our borders? Dangers that include bandits and human traffickers?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That we can stand here and debate this at all is a testament to the measures that were taken to make this place safer. If you cannot see that, perhaps you might consider that you are being a little shortsighted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Who are you calling shortsighted?! Ryle, say something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>My guild, the Desert Wings, haven't felt the need for a country. The merchant guilds agree on this as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You're just wasting everybody's time if your only goal is to force your own opinions on us. I'm wondering, is there a point to all your bleating?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Besides, I have a vested interest in keeping public order...less than perfect. You'll put certain markets out of business if all those, ahem, deplorables...are eliminated from the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>For example, ours in particular. Both of us would be out a job. You wouldn't want that, would you? What use are vigilantes without any bandits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You're an idealist, I'll give you that, but the desert is not a place where ideals are enough to survive on. You should know this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You've had your say already. It's my turn now. Nefertiti, why do we still not have permission to trade with foreign countries?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Every application is being given fair judgment after strictly impartial examinations. As to why you personally have not received permission, well, I could not say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huh. Then, a question: what is the point of this parliament? If this is not a proper government, why do we need the nobility's permission to trade?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It's a simple division of labor. We, the nobility, maintain and manage the bigger picture while the rest of you take care of the details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Is that so? In that case, the nobility is not holding up their end of this little bargain. If you don't do a better job managing foreign relations, your negligence will continue to cost us many lucrative business opportunities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>We are doing everything that is demanded of us. If you have issues with the current administration, then you are welcome to set yourselves up outside of the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Duly noted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If there are no other issues, I bid you all farewell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Hold on, Nefertiti. What do you plan on doing if the desert is invaded again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You believe there are still those who hunt the surviving Sephira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I do. As long as we are not an established country, then we are unable to formally request assistance from other such countries. Have you given any thought to that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Have you any proof of an imminent threat? We cannot make political decisions based on mere guesswork. Goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Will you nobles not do anything until you yourselves are in danger?! If you had been there back then, we might have had a different outcome!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hey! Wait! Ugh... This is so frustrating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Oh, come on! Are you not done dragging me around?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Nope. Not done. Eat more. Food! Uhm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It's Balt. You just ate all those noodles, and you still wanna eat more?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Balt! Fun. I like you. So, eat more. Fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Taste. New! More! Balt, more new!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Yeah, I'd like to hang out more, but I gotta go. Sorry, but this is goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Balt? Hate...Zofia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Of course not. We just shared a meal together, right? That means we're friends now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>F-friend? Wh-what? I like Balt! So... Okay! Happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Well, if we meet again, let's get some of that bean soup you were eyeballing. It's a really sweet specialty of the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I'm sure you'll like it, Zofia. This is a promise between friends! You can never break a promise between friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Pro...mise. Food promise! Okay! Sweet, fun, yes! Balt! Now! Food!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>No, like I said... Aw, man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I was wondering where you'd gone. Never thought I'd find you babysitting. She's not your secret illegitimate child, is she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Seriously, Carla? Whatever. How was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Same as usual. She dodged every question I needed answers to. You can never tell what that Nefertiti is hiding behind her smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Where did you come from, little one? Can I join you two?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Mark! There! Aah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Wha—? Hey! What the hell?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Uh, maybe she saw the birthmark on my hip? I guess it would look weird and scary to a little kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Monsters! Everybody, run! Monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Balt! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>You don't gotta tell me! Let's get 'em!</td>
</tr>
