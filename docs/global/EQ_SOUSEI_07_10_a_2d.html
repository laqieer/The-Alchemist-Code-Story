<td>It's working! Then this should...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wait, Seeker! "Make room!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>This Cursed Beast can control weather?! It can control lightning?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That...was a human? But one not of this region...with a power also not from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Then, you should leave, human. I know not what methods you used to reach this closed off region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>However, this place is a land of ruin forsaken by the gods. There is nothing you for you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Did that Cursed Beast just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Did it just speak to us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hold on. Wait a second! What do you mean this place was forsaken by the gods?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You were the one who ruined this region...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Or did you not?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I see. You are a visitor from the future. Then I must have fulfilled my role.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Listen well, human. Creation was destroyed by the flood of sin. And yet the fires of hope have not been extinguished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wait for it. Crave it. A new era will come once again! Those golden days will return!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I am but a pillar protecting the human world until that day arrives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>A Cursed Beast...protecting humans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If so, then what are you doing right now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What is your reason for driving these people—the people of the Avaritia Belt—into a corner like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Not...yet! I can...still fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Those people are failures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Failures?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>After the age of dragons crumbled, we called on the gods to bring new knowledge to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(You brought about us humans... It's just as Bianca said. Then that means...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Humans. You who will inherit our future. We wish for eternal prosperity this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Because of this sin of becoming the stagnation of the human world, the ladder to the end of the world, is unneeded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We Beasts are the pillars that have taken sin from you humans to give you a better world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That is our duty, the reason we pillar Beasts exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Taking the sin from humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That doesn't make sense. Aren't they made to eradicate humans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's an interesting thing you mention, my young friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Let me ask you. Who exactly was it that told you that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That's just... I mean, what else would they exist for?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The Cursed Beasts threaten our lives by simply existing! This whole world has been ruined just because of their presence, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I cannot disagree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But consider this: the fact that we will be decimated by the Cursed Beasts does not necessarily mean that their purpose exists for that purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>For example, humans cut down trees to make firewood, not for the sake of eliminating the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>From what I've observed, the Cursed Beasts accumulate the sin of people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>The corruption of the people of each region, Lust in this region's case, is what feeds the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So the destruction of the regions is simply a kind of...side effect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Unless even that is just a part of some greater process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>So that is the true purpose of the Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's impossible... You expect us to believe that nonsense? Your actions are threatening the existence of humans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You're trying to destroy this region right now! How do you explain that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>They are necessary sacrifices. To overcome sin, an equal virtue is essential. Therefore, we have waited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>We waited for the time when the power to overthrow the region was birthed and nurtured within humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The compassion that triumphs over envy. The tolerance that repels rage. The control that resists gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The innocence untainted by lust. The diligence to traverse over sloth. The loyalty to surpass pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>And the prudence not to be swayed by greed. And yet... And yet...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>They were not born into this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That is what has led to this ending.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Doing something so self-serving—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>My, my, now this is an interesting conversation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I guess so. Sounds to me like all they did was put a lid on their tough situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>All right! We landed successfully! I'm going to head out. What are you going to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Luckily, the Cursed Beast hasn't deployed its sanctuary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>So I'll use this ship's resources to give it a hard time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Roger that! I'll leave you to it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>An intelligent Cursed Beast that understands human speech and can communicate. If this is their true form, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I might've just found myself a pretty interesting research subject.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>This region's people are unfit to be the seeds left behind in the new world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Aaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Stop! You can't wound it with your gear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Leave this to us and retreat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That is the strongest being! It's an obstacle that we are meant to defeat and overcome!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Will there ever be a greater chance to surpass that Beast, to surpass Lord Kubera?! This is the only chance for us to earn the honor of being the strongest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>.........</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Do you see? These people are biologically deranged. Their natural instincts are broken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>These are not the people who will inherit our next age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Respecting strength rather than compassion and loving violence rather than order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>We cannot entrust our hope to beings such as this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>That is why I will decimate them. I will eradicate them. For the tomorrow we wish for, I must destroy this region!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Nimul! The townspeople...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>We cannot allow you to go any further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Why do you block my path, visitor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>They are not worthy of your protection. I have told that they are not beings that should be given tomorrow, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>There are no ranks to life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I will admit that I do not understand their values.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Fighting just to get stronger—and the mentality of using the lives of their comrades and themselves as tools to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>It's clear that they are incompatible with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>But to use that to as a reason to kill them? To take their lives?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>That is not right. That should never be the way things are done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>That's the future we want! The tomorrow we want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Bear and accept this sin as well! There's more life yet to come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Incomprehensible. That contradicts our duty. I will not heed your wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>No! Listen to my words!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Yes, just like they did...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Access to the Invidia Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Access to the Ire Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>We will become stones and submit to your will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>So that is your power! My fellow pillar Beasts...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Here I come, Mammon! Our answer is choosing to accept our sins!</td>
</tr>
