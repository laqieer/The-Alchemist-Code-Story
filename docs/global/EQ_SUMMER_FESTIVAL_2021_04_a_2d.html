<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>I was just walking around the festival, and then those guys... Thank you so much for getting me out of that mess.</td>
</tr>

<td>You're involved with the festival, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>Indeed, I am. I hope that through the festival I can make people properly aware of Wadatsumi culture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Wadatsumi culture?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yes, in fact, I am from the family of a Wadatsumi priestess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>I see...</td>

<td>(No wonder this festival feels so nostalgic... Someone with Wadatsumi priestess ancestry is involved.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>My ancestors were targeted for their lineage, so they were forced to flee for their lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>When Wadatsumi was invaded, the world was told of its ill repute as justification, and that reputation wasn't easy to fix.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>The people of Wadatsumi weren't allowed to explain themselves. They could only run. So my ancestors fled to the depths of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>But they were discovered because the Wadatsumi priestess's voice could be heard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>Of course, what had been done was unforgiveable. Plotting to conquer the world, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>But because she fought for us, the evils of the Wadatsumi invasion were brought to light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>If she'd not done what she did, I'm sure we'd still be suffering because the truth wouldn't be known.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>Now that so much time has passed, I no longer have to hide my lineage or flee like my ancestors did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>We are still often misunderstood, but more and more people are willing to learn about Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>Now, I have the chance to share our culture... And it's all thanks to her efforts back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>Interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>Oh, excuse me! We'd only just met, and here I am telling my entire family's life story. Well, I'll go back to meandering.</td>
</tr>

<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>Ah, it's you from before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>The thing is, the implements we use for our rituals have been stolen. They aren't very valuable, so they weren't guarded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Female</td>
<td>But they've been in my family for generations, and they strengthen a priestess's power. I need them to bring solace to my ancestors' spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>They empower a priestess?</td>
</tr>

<td colspan="2"><img src="../img/backgrounds/bg08.png" alt="bg08"></td></tr>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>(Those idiots must be planning to bolster their own ritual with the ancient implements.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>(They're going to ruin everything after Button fought through everything, as hatred threatened to consume her...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>...I can't stand idly by.</td>

<tr>

<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>Um, Miss... Why don't you let me worry about the ritual artifact stuff?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
