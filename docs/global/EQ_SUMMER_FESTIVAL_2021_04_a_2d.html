<td>Uwaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey! You sobering up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>S-Sorry! S-So sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Geez... Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Y-Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I was just walking around the festival, and then those guys... Thank you so much for getting me out of that mess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You're involved with the festival, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Indeed, I am. I hope that through the festival I can make people properly aware of Wadatsumi culture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wadatsumi culture?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes, in fact, I am from the family of a Wadatsumi priestess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(No wonder this festival feels so nostalgic... Someone with Wadatsumi priestess ancestry is involved.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My ancestors were targeted for their lineage, so they were forced to flee for their lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>When Wadatsumi was invaded, the world was told of its ill repute as justification, and that reputation wasn't easy to fix.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The people of Wadatsumi weren't allowed to explain themselves. They could only run. So my ancestors fled to the depths of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But they were discovered because the Wadatsumi priestess's voice could be heard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Of course, what had been done was unforgiveable. Plotting to conquer the world, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But because she fought for us, the evils of the Wadatsumi invasion were brought to light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If she'd not done what she did, I'm sure we'd still be suffering because the truth wouldn't be known.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Now that so much time has passed, I no longer have to hide my lineage or flee like my ancestors did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We are still often misunderstood, but more and more people are willing to learn about Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Now, I have the chance to share our culture... And it's all thanks to her efforts back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh, excuse me! We'd only just met, and here I am telling my entire family's life story. Well, I'll go back to meandering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>She who bore the weight of hatred but was not crushed by it... Her determination has done so much for her people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>FÃ¼ry achieved what she set out to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Whether I fall or not, the damage we do to our oppressors is now a part of history. If it sheds even a little light on Lost Blue...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That dream I entrust to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So... Button did not succumb to hatred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(You knew what you had to do and you faced it head on. You were amazing, Button.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(I couldn't do what you did.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You don't need a knight. You became strong enough on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I realize now that I'm even less worthy to take her hand than I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The question of worth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It sounds more like an excuse to avoid trying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What's that? There's some kind of ruckus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ah, it's you from before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The thing is, the implements we use for our rituals have been stolen. They aren't very valuable, so they weren't guarded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But they've been in my family for generations, and they strengthen a priestess's power. I need them to bring solace to my ancestors' spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>They empower a priestess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Maybe we need more power. If we had...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I remember now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(Those idiots must be planning to bolster their own ritual with the ancient implements.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(They're going to ruin everything after Button fought through everything, as hatred threatened to consume her...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...I can't stand idly by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Um, Miss... Why don't you let me worry about the ritual artifact stuff?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>They were stolen, so I'll get them back.</td>
</tr>
