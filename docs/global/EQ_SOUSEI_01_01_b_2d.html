<td>Nimul... What the hell was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This power... Is this what you've been researching?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Research...? What research?! Explain yourself, Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's an entirely new technique, derived from Spiritbonding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The Spiritbonding that we use is affected by the traits and constitution of the wielder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This Spiritbonding technique, however, has been theoretically and systematically rendered so that those effects remain constant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It can also be used independently of Sephiron's power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Meaning that it can combat the corruption far more efficiently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(The effects remain constant...? It cannot be that simple!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(If the winds of Spiritbonding are akin to the breath of a bellows, then the technique that Nimul used just now would be...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(Nothing short of a rampaging windstorm!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>However, it is still not complete. It remains insufficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>More research will be necessary. The theoretical aspect still has a ways to go in terms of accuracy. That, and it is yet lacking in strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Nimul... I believe you said that this technique can be used independently of Sephiron's power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Right. Once this technique is complete, any one of the Sephira will be able to wield it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(The implications of this are...catastrophic! If this technique is completed, the way of the world will cease to exist!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So, this is how you intend to oppose the way of the world, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oppose...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes. I'm going to abolish both sin and the unnatural order of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Tch... You're starting to sound like a lunatic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm going to do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm going to reshape the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Reshape...the world?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This is too much... Of the two of us, you're definitely the stranger one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm going to need your help to change the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I want you to make me a weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>A true master is chosen by their weapon. If your ambitions require one of my blades...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Then so be it. I will do whatever I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Heh. I'm glad to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I can't deny that my curiosity is piqued. What weapon will these hands forge for you? What manner of steel will you wield in pursuit of your ambitions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What is it? Is there something up there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Is that...a ship? Why is there a ship in the sky?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's headed for the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Let's go, Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes, my lord!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Wh-what is that thing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Th-there's a ship in the sky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The world's gone mad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>H-hey! Someone's coming down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I can't believe it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I've finally found it.</td>
