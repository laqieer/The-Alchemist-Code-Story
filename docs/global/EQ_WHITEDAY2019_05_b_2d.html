<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's a hit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Gino, can you stand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Tch. I don't need your pity. You went easy on me, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The outcome was obvious, but you have gotten much stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Tch! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why can't I beat you?! After all that training...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I had no distractions! I kept my focus on my training in order to surpass you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So why...? Why the hell can't I defeat you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That is because you still haven't found your true purpose as a knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>My purpose...as a knight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The most important thing for a knight is that they have a reason for getting stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Had you this understanding...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You would not be trampling upon that which others consider most important to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I didn't mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But it's so true! They're an OTP for a reason!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I can see the two of them building such a happy little family together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It'll be so perfect! A true happy ending!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I already know that not all families end up happy. You don't have to tell me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But... But that's why I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Umm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm...ry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I said, I'm sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>To be honest, I still can't agree with the way you think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But at least you never berated me for my beliefs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Just like how I have my creed, you have strong beliefs of your own, but I refused to even try to see things from your point of view.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>For that, I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Um... Hello?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>This is...surprising.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm actually used to people not being able to see things my way. They even call me the Mad Cupid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I've never had anybody say something like that to me. This is something entirely new.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hehe! This is nice! It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Gino? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Uhh... N-nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hmm? Hahaha! I see, I see. This is so cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What do you mean, Eve?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hehehe. Oh, never mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You're a good person, Gino!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yes he is, Eve. It's just hard to see through his tough exterior sometimes. Hahah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Just last week, he was holding an umbrella up for a stray kitten, keeping that grimace of his in place all the while. It was quite charming to see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Y-you saw that?! N-never bring that up again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Meow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What's with you? Don't you have parents, or a brother, or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Meow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You just stay there. This umbrella's all busted up, so here. You can have it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Don't you follow me. You'll just get soaked in the rain again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>He couldn't resist helping the little thing out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Awwww...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Don't look at me like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. Moa clearly thought it was very nice of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Tch! Whatever...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Heheh. Isn't this adorable?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Adorable, huh...? What about a stuffed kitten as a present? No, wait... Never mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I thought you were being oddly quiet. Were you thinking about what gift to get her this whole time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Yeah, flowers might be nice. I bet she would show me the greatest smile if I gifted her a bouquet of flowers for White Day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And that... That would make my day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Come to think of it, weren't you looking for me? Is there something you need?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'd be happy to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Nah, don't worry about it. I've gotta pick out a present for her on my own. That's how it should be done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Heh. Today's the day I get to show what I'm made of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Besides, there's someone else here who needs your assistance more than me, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Regardless of how you feel about this day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The cookies taste no less sweet!</td>
