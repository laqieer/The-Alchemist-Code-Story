<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I got that you're related to the chief of the Alize people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>But what does that have to do with Gluttony's cavalry not wanting to lend us a hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's not very complicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There is a deep feud that lies between the native Alize people and Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>A deep feud?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I've heard of that before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The native Alize people, once known as the Wolves of the Plain, were once engaged in a long war with Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You can't call that a war. It was a one-sided invasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Those from Gluttony attempted to oppress, exploit, and turn those of the Alize people into slaves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's natural that such egregious actions would be met with resistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I agree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>As a result of their defiance, Gluttony also suffered extensive damage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The war raged on for a long time. Because of this, their hostile relationship continues on to this day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So basically...there's no way they'd help the Holy Guard who employs knights belonging to the tribe they'll never conquer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Exactly. Do you understand now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But...isn't there some way we can convince them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That would be completely inefficient. Let's hurry to the wind shrine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wait! I told you that we should first head to Gluttony!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There is a sinister presence at the wind shrine! I'm certain that the 4th Regiment has headed that way as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Also...the lives of all from the people of Alize are in danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I cannot accept that. The Alize people only account for a small portion of the native people here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey, Vice-Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Of course, I'd like to help them if we could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>However, there is no way we can risk the lives of humanity in order to do so! Don't you agree?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We are the Holy Guard. We exist to maintain peace within the continent. If the Sacred Stone in Gluttony were to be stolen...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If its powers were to be exploited, we're not just talking about a local native tribe...the lives of millions will be at risk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Are you an idiot?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's not there! I am certain of it! The Sacred Stone is not in Gluttony!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Answer me. How can you be so sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You're bluffing. In that case, I reject your proposal. We won't waste any more time here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We're going to head straight for to the center of Gluttony. I'm ordering you as your Vice-Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Don't you understand what I'm saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>As a knight, you must follow through on the order given to you! There is no excuse for insubordination!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If you resist, then you are guilty of violating a direct order! If you still wish to act on your own accord...then you don't belong in the 2nd Regiment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Fine! I'll give this thing back to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Seida?! That's your coat of arms!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm gonna do what I need to do. Feels refreshing, actually. Bye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ohh, teacher!</td>
</tr>
