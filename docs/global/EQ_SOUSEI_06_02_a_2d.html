<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>My, Quence. You look exhausted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>My apologies. I merely spaced out a little bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Satna seems to be in an awful mood lately. I've barely had a wink of sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Apparently the Cursed Beast's core is not happy with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Controlling the Cursed Beast is essential to your plans, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Can you do it in such a state?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You'll just have to trust me for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Eh, even if you don't, it's not like you have any choice but to follow my plans at this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>After all, this country is already at its limit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The enemy approaches. Those who rejected the sin of Envy are headed our way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, so our guests of honor have finally arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I worried that they might get stranded in the Invidia Belt, but this means everything is still going according to plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Will you be able to finish it this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>They are strong...and the world is governed by the strongest. I understand this law of nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But these lands have no use for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The flames of my Wrath burn fierce. They will face my reckoning and they will be rewarded an existence as little more than ash.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Then I'll leave it to you. Though a single Fallen may struggle to deal with that Spiritbonding on his own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Understood. I will send help with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...Sulva.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Please accompany my brother and crush the invading army from Invidia, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Put that Red Blade of yours to some good use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Then I suppose I have no choice but to continue with our plans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Soon these lands will meet their end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>May it all turn to dust. Let's cause all the mayhem we can before that time arrives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Land ho!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Everyone, be on guard! This harbor is within the territory of the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>We don't know where their ships may be lying in wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So this is the border...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We were so busy fighting Leviathan from the airship the last time we passed over here, I barely had a chance to look around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This place where the lands of Wrath and Envy met in a clash, bringing the two together unexpectedly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It looks even worse than I imagined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>These scorching lands must be causing the sea to evaporate. Just look at all this steam. This is going to be a problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We'll probably get burned if we get any closer. We should try to avoid touching it at all cost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>O-OUCH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I literally just told you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Eulalia, what is the magil like in this area?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>There's enough here, but I have a bad feeling about what lies further inland...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I think it may be exactly like Nimul said. It'll become harder and harder to use our powers as we head further in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Just as I thought...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Sounds like magitek will still be A-OK then! Though it won't be able to extract any magil from the atmosphere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>But if we bring our own power source it shouldn't be an issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That's a relief. There's a pretty good chance we'll get caught up in some nasty business sooner or later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The more of us are capable of fighting, the better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Well then, as we discussed before, we will start constructing a base in this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Daphne and her knights will go with you to the heart of the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The shield regimen is ready whenever you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Can I trust you to take the lead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yup, just leave it to me. Although, I have to say I'd be more shocked if any of us got lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You'll find out soon enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>They're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>They dare step foot on these lands without a shred of fear for my wrath and retaliation... Fine. I'll show them the error of their ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>My liege. Is it time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Disperse the troops. The enemy has means to attack across a wide area, so spread yourselves out to meet them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Show me the King's Blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>This?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>—I understand. I am no longer deemed fit to be king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You may carry that blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...Yes, my liege.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Tell the soldiers this! Those we'll face here are no less than our sworn enemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Loot! Kill! Pillage! Crush them with all you got! Take every ounce of wrath in your body and turn it into power! May it consume you till there's nothing left!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Eek, the ground is actually on fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Little else but scorched earth as far as the eye can see. I see what you were saying now, Andechs...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Remember not to touch it. I'm not just saying that to prevent more burns here; there is corruption in the flames that are spread throughout these lands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>One little accidental touch, and we've got someone losing themselves to corruption on our hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>N-no way! You're just trying to scare us, right? Right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>M-my shield's protection will—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>No, preserve your energy. You're our trump card. Don't waste your skills lightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Right, Andechs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yup, we're definitely gonna need you down the line, so just hold out a little longer, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Understood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>But seriously, how far have we walked by now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>When are we doing to hit some civilization?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>If you'd come a few months earlier, you would've found plenty of it already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You mean—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It was all burned to the ground. That corrupted rain of fire razed these plains. A downpour that left nothing behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>It burned down? Then...what happened to the people that lived here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Those that survived fled to the capital city of the Ira Belt, Horeb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>The ones that weren't fast enough either burned alive or turned into Fallen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>This is the reality with which the Ira Belt has to cope. Ever since Satna's awakening, this place has become completely uninhabitable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Which is why they attacked the Invidia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Indeed. Living beings need food, shelter, clothes...all kinds of things. That which the land gives us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>But this land has long since stopped giving us anythi—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What's this?! An earthquake?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Worse. Look at that mountain over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Huh? The mountain is spewing fire?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>That's Shinai, the sacred volcano that stands at heart of the Ira Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>The forbidden land beneath which Satna sleeps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>So that's where Satna is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>It's emitting a tremendous amount of burning magil. It feels like the Cursed Beast may wake up any moment now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>That's why we have to hurry. Even if we managed to evacuate the citizens of the Ira Belt, we may not have the time to strike it—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Something is concealing their presence behind the mountain's magil—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Oh no! Nimul! Look up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Th-that's—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Ah, so you managed to dodge me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>But for how long—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Shield regimen! Prepare for battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Yes, ma'am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>We're surrounded! Is this because of—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>It's that stealth magitek again! Dammit! I was so distracted by the weird magil in this area that I didn't notice them approach!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Andechs! This will be your grave!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Your Highness. Why are you doing this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>You always cared so much about your citizens. You were trying to quell the conflict in these lands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>So why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>It is simple human nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I finally realized it after I fell to the corruption and gave in to wrath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>There will never be an end to the conflict in the Ira Belt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>There is joy in stealing! Superiority is reserved for those that trample others! There is no greater delight than taking back that which was stolen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>This is simply humanity's essence! We who are descendants of the Beasts, we who were forged in their image!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>You're wrong! Humans were made to help one another! The strong are supposed to protect the weak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Reach out to whoever seeks our aid. Wield our sword for whoever is in need. Those are the ideals you taught me—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>That was what we believed in! The ideals all knights were supposed to strive for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Face the facts, Andechs. We're not helping one another. We are simply animals competing for survival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Then I will bring an end to that! Mark my words!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Nimul, I'm counting on you for backup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>"I am Transcender of the Gate of Envy!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Mwuahahaha! Still trying that same old trick?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>What?! He managed to block a full frontal blow like it was nothing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>These flames that fell from the skies only fuel my Fallen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>It is nothing like the playthings you faced in the Invidia Belt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Furthermore—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Sulva!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Yes, my liege. I will follow the plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Huh?! A child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>...I missed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Oh? So you managed to avoid our ambush? Then it will be all the more satisfying to crush you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>These guys are nothing like they were back in the Invidia Belt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>They've got the home-field advantage... These scorched lands are what they know best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Running across wide open fields without any places to duck for cover. They know how to utilize every corner of this place... This is going to be tough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Shield regimen, reform the lines! Don't let the formation crumble by chasing them too far!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>But—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>The enemy possesses superior mobility. If you chase them, the formation will fall apart and they'll pick you off one by one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>At this rate, they're going to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>That just means we've got to stop them from moving, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Can you do it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>I don't know, but we've got to try! Nyx?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Got it! Good thing we brought Libra along from the airship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Space-Time Manipulation: Ignition!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>We just need a tiny opening—there! Stand still!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Ghn! This power—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Nimul! This is it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Got it! Andechs? Are you ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Always!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Mad king Arius, you who have forgotten our ideals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>It's time for you to rest in peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>You impudent fool!</td>
</tr>
