<td>True.</td>

<td>Still, Saga is far from Northern Pride. It may be difficult for the Holy Guard to directly intervene.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>That's why we can leak this information to Gluttony and Slothstein!</td>

<td>If those two countries, across the sea, were to exercise their authority, then I'm sure it would paralyze even the Trade Company from acting carelessly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/arub.png" alt="Aruba" height="128"><br>Aruba</td>
<td>From the perspective of the two countries, they can take the attitude that they haven't been involved in the experiments, and Northern Pride will own them a favor.</td>

<td>But what about Slothstein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/luca.png" alt="Lucian" height="128"><br>Lucian</td>
<td>Although they were probably imported, they did have Guard Droids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/luca.png" alt="Lucian" height="128"><br>Lucian</td>
<td>To avoid any suspicion of being involved, there's a possibility that they won't touch on this problem altogether.</td>

<td>Well...hmm...I'm not sure. To be honest, I'm really not sure how Slothstein will act on this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/luca.png" alt="Lucian" height="128"><br>Lucian</td>
<td>Your idea relies on the basis of creating a standoff from both countries. It won't quite work with just Gluttony.</td>

<td>Really?!</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/yuto.png" alt="Yuto" height="128"><br>Yuto</td>
