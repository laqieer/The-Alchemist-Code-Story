<td>001</td>
<td>Ack! I didn't sign up for this! It was supposed to be a simple escort job!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Get out of this forest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>A-ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The rest of them have fled. Well, we've chased them out quite extravagantly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I can't believe they'd trespass into our forest so boldly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Gluttony... They seem to have forgotten about the dark abyss lying asleep in the forest of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Aghhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The true protector has finally made an appearance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Shaman! You're safe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm sorry. There were more rats than I'd expected. It delayed me from getting here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And the treatment for the tree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We picked the Spirit Grass. If we turn this into powder and mix it with the earth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Understood. I see. So this grass is effective. I'll remember that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Are you two all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That being said, what are we going to do from here? They're not the type who would give up after one failure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's where things get difficult. This is the edge of the forest, where the voice of the spirits doesn't reach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>In order to ward off people like them, we might just really have to station guardians.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If that's the case, I have one idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We've learned that they've been breaking the Magna Code with their experiments here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This is an act that goes against the suzerain law, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>True.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Still, Saga is far from Northern Pride. It may be difficult for the Holy Guard to directly intervene.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's why we can leak this information to Gluttony and Slothstein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If those two countries, across the sea, were to exercise their authority, then I'm sure it would paralyze even the Trade Company from acting carelessly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>From the perspective of the two countries, they can take the attitude that they haven't been involved in the experiments, and Northern Pride will own them a favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's not a bad idea, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Fortunately, I'm well connected enough in Gluttony to make negotiations possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But what about Slothstein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Although they were probably imported, they did have Guard Droids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>To avoid any suspicion of being involved, there's a possibility that they won't touch on this problem altogether.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Well...hmm...I'm not sure. To be honest, I'm really not sure how Slothstein will act on this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Your idea relies on the basis of creating a standoff from both countries. It won't quite work with just Gluttony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I agree...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I may have a lead in Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes. A wizard called Vincent. He lives in a very large mansion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Vincent?! The 'wizard of the machine country'? That Vincent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yes. But he hates being called that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What? You are friends with the authority on magic theory?! You've got surprising connections.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>A little too surprising! It's the biggest surprise of the day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I was going to send him a letter regarding another matter. I should able to contact him right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Well then, it's decided! We're going to get busy from here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Will this enable us to protect the forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Of course! On my stubbornness as a merchant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hey, what's with the long face. The forest is safe now, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I was thinking about the fight just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I think that fight was a necessary one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Sometimes people need to fight. It may be against beasts or against nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Or against others with ideas that differ from our own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's why a business like mine works.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I think you'd be able to make a name for yourself as a mercenary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'm a tree doctor. I'm fine with just that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I see. What I said was stupid. Forget about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I hate fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Because I hate fighting, I realized that I must think about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I want to know how to minimize casualties...and to end the conflict as swiftly as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I realized that that's what I should be thinking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I see. My work here is done. I'll move on to the next battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Knowing you, I doubt we'll meet in battle again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>If we ever meet again, tell me about your battle as a tree doctor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I will. I promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>If Aruba and Lucian werenâ€™t here...I wouldn't have been able to protect this forest myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>There is more I must learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I will protect this world...this beautiful forest, with my own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>So...let's go. Like the wind that travels this earth, we head on our next journey.</td>
</tr>
