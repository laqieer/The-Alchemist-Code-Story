<td>Lost Blue is a place where people are discarded and forgotten. By their homelands. By the continent. By the world at large.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Those raised in Lost Blue are never given the chance to live a normal life in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's what happens when you're born in a cesspit. They don't have anyone to protect them. They don't even have the right to work. Stealing is the only way they can survive.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Even if they venture out under the big, blue sky, they just end up being ridiculed for being illiterate and unskilled, ignorant of the ways of the world above.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Meanwhile, the so-called allies of justice seek only to hide the dark corners of the world and keep rogue elements from interfering with their monopoly on power.</td>

<td>That's why, in order to save Lost Blue, I have to take on the entire world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is our last stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We will fight until our dying breaths!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We will fight for our right to a sky in Lost Blue, the place untouched by sunlight!</td>

<td>I want to try lining up somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Lining up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's silly, but it is a dream of mine. So don't laugh, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Okay, well... Here. This is a list of the "Top 100 Restaurants Worth Lining Up For!", published by The Babel Continental Times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ohh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Imagine this: We'd spend about thirty minutes—maybe an hour—lining up for our food with other customers, but they'd give us a menu to look through while we waited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I bet it'd take you at least that long to come to a decision anyway. I'd probably struggle a bit, too, so I'd just go with the chef's recommendation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hee hee. I'd probably end up ordering the same thing you did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Anyway, after another hour or so of waiting, we'd finally get inside. We'd be served our food, wolf it down, and be out within fifteen minutes. After all, there'd still be a long line of people waiting to take their seats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If you couldn't finish your portion, I'd eat it for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Then we'd walk around in silence for a bit—until, all of a sudden, at the exact same time, we'd both say...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>"I've had better."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I can imagine it clear as day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We'd both agree that it was a waste of time, but, somehow, on our next day off, we'd end up lining up again, even if it's boiling hot or pouring rain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'd be happy to do that with you, Sol. Even if it was snowing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Good. Sounds like we're on, no matter the weather.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Let's take a trip all around the world! I bet there are tons of dishes out there we've never even heard of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I like the way you think! We'll go to all kinds of different restaurants and stalls and eateries, and bring back snacks for the other Templars—as well as stories of our travels, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I know! Let's get a map, and circle all the places we want to visit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That's a great idea! Then we can put a cross through all the places we've been to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Before long, it'll be covered in circles and crosses. Countries, regions, roads...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>We'll dominate the world with our stomachs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>If anyone can do that, it's us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yeah! It'll be a piece of cake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>"The goddess frowns on those who cannot eat the scraps that a dog will not."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Is that a saying from one of your philosophy books?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It means that we should value food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hehe. I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I'll never throw anything away. You can count on that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Never ever?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Never ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You lack the conviction to see your ambitions through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>There is but a single reason for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You still cling to your bonds with others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Your comrades, and your home. All the things you feel the need to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I, on the other hand, have cut all such ties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>So conviction...means cutting ties?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>S-Sol...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>A-Acht...</td>

<tr>

<td>075</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Everything feels so...hollow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I can't let it end like this. Their names... The lives they built... The futures they believed in...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I won't let them be forgotten!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>...!</td>

<tr>
<td>108</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Lighten up, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>D-Dr..ei...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>You put on a very good show. I could not have asked for better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Wh-who goes there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Pleased to make your acquaintance. I am a big fan of standing on the sidelines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Guidecca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>That's my name. Don't wear it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>As for the final two Templars...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>An abnormally large Alchemia explosion occurred on the battlefield at the time of their death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>As a result, we have been unable to confirm for ourselves the identity or gender of the bodies recovered from the site, which were burned beyond recognition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Instead, we have had to rely on testimony from the captains who were present at the scene. However, through their statements we have been able to determine that the recovered bodies...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Surrender! You have nothing to gain by dragging out this fight any longer! You have already lost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>You say such...amusing things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Hmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Do you even know what you're fighting for anymore?! What is your aim here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>My aim? What a fascinating question. Not that it's any of your concern, but it's time for me to harvest the fruits of my labors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Huzzaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I-I got him! Finish him! Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I do appreciate the way you've neatly gathered yourselves in one place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaarghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Hrrgh! Surround him! Kill him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>There are none left who have witnessed them, are there? So what does it matter who I am?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>"Them"? Are you talking about your Templar friends?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Friends? Heheh... Ahahahaha! Friends, you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Are you planning to die for the sake of those friends of yours?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Me? Oh, no. I don't think so. I'm really not that sort of person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Then what are you doing here?! Who even are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Who am I, you ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Why don't we say that I'm Sol?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>My precious flower blooms amidst the cacophonous silence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>What is the meaning of this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>In the end, even I shall become its fertilizer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Th-this is bad! Kill him! Quickly! We have to stop him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>I...will complete the sun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Now, here's a delightfully creepy tidbit for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Right at the moment when my beliefs came to fruition, and my long-held dream blossomed into bloom...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>I realized that it was all because of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>I was the one who poisoned your will. Without me, you would never have achieved anything of note.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>I've never felt so guilty, so terrible, and so reluctantly grateful all at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>I will take root inside of you, Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>I'm happy to die for that privilege.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>However, through their statements we have been able to determine that the recovered bodies...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>And I'm not alone in feeling that way. Iris is the same. Aren't you, dear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Belong to Sol, the leader of the Templars, and his associate and fellow Templar, Acht.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>While we are still uncertain as to the origin of the twin blades that were retrieved from the vicinity of the incident...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>It has nonetheless been determined...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>That the issue is not one of due import, and thus unworthy of further investigation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>I am Guidecca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Those who yearned for the sun burnt their wings when they flew too close to it, leaving behind a brilliant red rose in its center. It is such a beautiful sight...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>As are we, my dear Iris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Are you watching, Iris? Can you see how my beliefs and your life have intertwined and blossomed into bloom at last?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Though you cannot see the individual colors, surely even you can tell that this glorious incursion is absolutely dazzling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Like a rainbow arcing across a spray of blood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Why now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>I feel fragments of my lost memories, of my truth, flitting through my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>I cannot help but recall the sacrifices I had them pay, the losses that shook me as much as them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>But...why? Why is it all coming back to me now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>I was abandoned in the age during which Babel was first formed. Deemed an unnecessary element of creation, I became the darkness that was purposefully forgotten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Yet even in my latent unconsciousness, I still sought that age of creation. I found myself reaching for the Alchemy Source at the zenith of all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>And, as a result, I created the Mystic Tower Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>I need to find myself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Or else the majority of my lost memories...and, indeed, much of my very self...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>All of it...will be lost.</td>
</tr>
