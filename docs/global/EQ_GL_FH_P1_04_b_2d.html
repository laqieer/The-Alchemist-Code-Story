<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You wouldn't know. You are not her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>

<td>They came prepared, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>My scry spoke true...</td>
</tr>

<td>Little helgwn, you have done well to break out of your cage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Your story does not end here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Run, little helgwn. Run.</td>
