<td>001</td>
<td>...Phew!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...Sorry for burdening you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>N-not at all. That was nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...I see. By the way, how did you know my name? Have we met somewhere previously?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>N-no, it's not like that... I came here to escort you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...Hmm. So, you're a messenger from the court. Sorry about that. I'm a little late, but I'll make sure the ceremony takes place on time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That being said, would you mind leaving me alone? I don't want to cause you any inconvenience like I did earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, it's not like that, u-um...wo-would you like to talk?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ta-talk?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Lupinus... That name sounds familiar. If I recall correctly, that was the name of the daughter from the Alstroemeria family. Ah, that must be you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I apologize for my rudeness. That being said, something urgent must have occurred for a Summoner like you to personally escort me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Um, no, I just came on my own. Also, you don't need to be so formal. Le-let's talk about something fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>S-s-something fun?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I-I...don't have much experience talking about such things, so I'm not sure I'll be able to do it well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh, um...heheh...actually, I don't have much experience either...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...Umm....I'm very honored to make the acquaintance of a Summoner from the Alstroemeria family such as yourself, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ack... I-I can't... Talking about something fun is too advanced for me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>N-not at all. I'm honored to be speaking with you like this as well... Actually, I'm not very good at this either...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...Heheh. I guess it's hard to excel at something you're not used to doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ah...ahahah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That being said, I never expected a high-ranking Summoner of Lustburg like you to converse with me like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Not at all... I'm really not that important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...Really? The relationship you have with the Summoning Beasts is amazing. That would hardly be the case for an ordinary Summoner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's because the Summoning Beasts are amazing. I merely respond to the expectations of everyone in the court by borrowing the Summoning Beasts' power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Respond to the expectations of everyone, huh? I was once like that as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I was celebrated as a Shaman, kept at a distance, and was made to live alone. Those around me held no ill intentions, however...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Peridot...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...I'm sorry to bore you with this talk. It really is difficult to talk about something fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...I was always alone as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You...? Right, of course. The daughter of a renowned family, as well as the possessor of considerable abilities... In a sense, I'm sure you were lonelier than I was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...Heheh. I'm not very good at talking about fun things either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>N-no, that's not...true. It's nice to talk with someone who understands how I feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But, even with the way that I am, I was saved by making a friend. Her name is Mielikki and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Mielikki...? You're Mielikki's friend?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh?! Peridot, do you know Mielikki?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yes, I know her...a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(Someone who has a relationship with Mielikki... Now I'm certain I'll be able to get along with her!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>U-um, Peridot! Would you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You'll pay for what you did to us earlier... This time we're going to seize you!</td>
</tr>
