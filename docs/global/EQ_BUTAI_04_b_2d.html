<td>Chihaya! Chihaya...why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I am nothing more than a mirage. The manifestation of the error of your ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Still...why did you have to...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You understood the weight of all you had done, yet you could not withdraw...so you became alone. Was what I entrusted to you too great a burden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We shared the same ideals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But we cannot be forgiven...so let me at least pray for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Kuza, proud warrior of Wadatsumi... Please... Save...Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>No! You can't go, Chihaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I pray you will reach the heights you...have always aspired for.</td>

<td>Chihaya...</td>

<tr>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Kudan... Kuza had been... Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You have also been pursuing power to fill the void in your soul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I trust you'll let us through now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Go on.</td>

<tr>

<td>Kuza...?</td>

<tr>

<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>

<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Go.</td>

<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>L-let me get you some aid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Can't you let me choose when I die?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This is how it's meant to be for a loser like me, who was tempted by the false light of absolute power. A light as bright and blinding as the sun's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ironic, isn't it? I was enthralled by the very being who took Wadatsumi away from us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Kuza!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I stood too close to the sun, not realizing that it was burning my own flesh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The sun is a lonely being, and yet...I so wanted to be like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But I wasn't strong enough to sever the bonds that linked me to you and Chihaya. I lacked that determination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I should have known. Truth is, I always had sunlight shining over me. I have been such a fool...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I doubt I'll be going where Chihaya is, but she reminded me that my love for Wadatsumi can live on without me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Kudan... Protect Wadatsumi. Protect our princess...and our home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Kuza!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I know you can do it. And...take this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Your pipe...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'll see you again, Brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Aren't you going to go after him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>A minor detail. I could ask you the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I've entrusted him with everything that needs to be.</td>
