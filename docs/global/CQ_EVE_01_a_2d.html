<td>Time has flown since your arrival in Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hehe. Another letter from Lady Eve. She may appear over-confident, but she's surprisingly dedicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That being said, the first letter I received from her was beyond the scope of unexpected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>An arrow?! Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm sorry! I tried to send you a letter attached to an arrow, but my hand started trembling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>A-a letter attached to an arrow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes! My name is Eve...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I want to become your bride!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yesterday, I saw your body while you were bathing. You've got that slim toned look! It's the ideal masculine body!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You made me realize that you're the only person for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Please, take me as your wife!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>She appeared along with her arrow letter before I could even read its contents. It was like she had launched herself along with her arrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>She truly was a woman that resembled the most delicate of arrows...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Heheh. Right now, she's training to cook...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(It might be a good idea to go see her the next time I head to Lustburg.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>To make my way to her...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There ya go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh, if I polish this monster's claw, it'll make a good fruit knife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>When it comes to becoming a good bride, it's all about the tools of the tradeâ™ª</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well then, I'm gonna really work on brushing up those cooking skills!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh?! Is that a monster...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't move!</td>
