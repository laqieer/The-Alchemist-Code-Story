<td>I'm tired.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Weak.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Actually, I would agree that some form of respite is in order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Once we're in Slothstein there's no predicting what might happen. It might be better for us to rest a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Indeed. Let's recuperate in that village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I hope they sell some kind of recovery item there. Like a Chocobo! Dude, I'd love a Chocobo just about now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There's a river. We might be able to fish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>How festive. Oh? That scent... I think I've just thought of a new recipe.</td>

<td>You're not going with them?</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They'll be fine on their own.</td>

<td>Hm? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...Who are you guys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, we might as well tell you. That's the Prince over there and we're his loyal companions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...Prince?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Noct...Noctis Lucis Caelum. Appearances aside, he's the Prince of Lucis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I am Dias Elysion. I am a knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So...you're a knight. I was getting that vibe from you. You might've not guessed it from the look of me, but I happen to be the Shield of the King.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We were sent by his father...the king...to escort him. You're not buying it from the look on your face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...You don't really seem like an escort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Guess you could say we're more like companions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You've got the smell of a lone wolf about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(That's right. I chose to go my own path. Logi and Agatha wanted us to continue together, but it's too late for that now.)</td>

<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Gladiolus! Over there, in that river...</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I just informed him that we're traveling with Crown Prince under the orders of the king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Dias?! Who would've thought we'd find you here...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Who are you guys?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
