<td>001</td>
<td>Even while we waste time here, Georgios is closing in on Voda!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Why was I even given the power of foresight...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There's a reason. I'm certain of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You were given the power by Asena, right? I'm certain we'll need it in order to protect Saga's future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Besides, I said that we can't beat Georgios in our current state, but there's another option—a way to make sure Voda survives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Did you come up with an idea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We can ask the Fuu faction for reinforcements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What! That's impossible...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I told you just now, didn't I? Don't try to handle everything on your own. This is a problem that concerns all of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Our power alone is not enough to protect Voda from Georgios. However, if we were to borrow Fuu's strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You might be right...but there's no way another faction would respond to our request for reinforcements!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Saga itself is in a crisis. Besides, I believe that the gulf between the separate tribes is not so deep that they would refuse a formal request for reinforcements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Furthermore, we can tell Fuu about your vision of Georgios attacking Voda and your vision of Saga's destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That would only make things worse. There's less chance they would act on something as unreliable as a vision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You may be right, but...I'm sure that Fuu has also detected the pressing crisis on Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Of course, if we mention it casually it'll sound like a falsehood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Fuu may falsely perceive it as a trap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>However, we must inform Fuu about your foresight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I choose to believe that Fuu will put all of Saga first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tina, Lisbeth, I want you to bring Voda to Fuu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Right! There's no need to defeat Georgios! All we need to do is save Voda!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You'll buy time by helping Voda escape to a village belonging to the Fuu faction. Meanwhile, I'll go and try to persuade Fuu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If Voda and Fuu were to combine their power, I'm sure they'd be able to defeat the likes of Georgios!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I wonder if Voda will accept that proposal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We have to persuade them at all costs. I must persuade Fuu and you must persuade Voda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Where is Voda?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>She is in the Water Temple deep within the Forest of Rukifojio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>All right, it's decided then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'll persuade her...for the future of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I will as well. Lisbeth, please support Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Well then, we'll bring Voda. Let's meet at the Fuu village of Lilith’s Hill!</td>
</tr>
