<td>Lisbeth! Kasumi! You've gotta get up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I cannot believe it. To think that you would not fall wholly unto the Darkness... Kasumi, you must remember the need to abandon yourself to the Darkness in your heart. Come to us. Walk by our sides.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Zain! Shut your damn mouth!</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>Were you ordered to capture Kasumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No one is giving us orders.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Destrolurk has set us free.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We help Destrolurk of our own free will.</td>

<td>Phantom Soldiers...with free will?</td>

<td>I didn't think that it was possible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...for the puppets with which you controlled could move on their own.</td>

<td>012</td>
<td>By ending this world, in which living and dead are locked in perverted bonds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Destrolurk will unmake the world, and from the Void it will be reborn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What hope have you of stopping it? You do nothing but summon the slumbering dead...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...and have them fight war after war in the name of your justice! You are nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But if the world ends, where do you think you'll all end up, huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If the world should be unmade, it goes without saying that we too, would disappear into the Void. However...our existence as Phantoms has always been a twisted one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>By unmaking the world, we can restore it to its truest form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>For this—to achieve true peace—we are prepared to wager our very existence!</td>
