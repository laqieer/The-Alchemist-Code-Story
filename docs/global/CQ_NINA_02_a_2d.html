<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Ngh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(Why did I stop?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why do you hesitate? Show me your resolve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Eep! Aaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ngh... I guess I really am weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Not at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You fight well and your talents are more than sufficient. However, you are lacking something crucial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Would you tell me the reason why you wish to join the Scarlet Flame Guard so badly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I want to repay Sir Gerald for everything he's done for me—but I'm not good enough, and I don't even know what it is I'm missing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I presume you are talking about the Sir Gerald who serves as the vice-captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes. Sir Gerald has helped me out a lot, and his father saved me once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I don't think I could ever truly repay him for everything he's done for me, but I want to try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I see. Miss Nina, what you lack is not strength. It is resolve...or perhaps I should say faith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>For whom do you fight? For what purpose? What are the beliefs that drive your blade, and where is your resolve to see them through?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>These are the things you lack, Miss Nina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The proof lies in your halted attack during our fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh? Th-that was just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I can understand your hesitation. It is something that we all face on the field of battle, many times over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>However, the only means of overcoming your hesitation is conviction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>As I have said, this is what you lack—and that is why you lost to me. It was not a question of strength, but of resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Conviction...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Your convictions have no justice to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If you truly wish to join, you must show me proof that you have the conviction to stand by your principles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>U-um!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>W-would you...keep teaching me? Please! I really, really want to improve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I suppose I could. My squadron is due to leave on a monster hunt shortly. Will you join us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes! I'd be happy to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Good. Glad to have you on board.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Y-you mean it?! Thank you! Thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Listen up, everyone. This is Nina. She'll be accompanying us on our mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>She's not a knight, but I'm sure you won't have any complaints about her sword arm. Treat her like she's part of the team!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hi! It's lovely to meet you all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>A therian?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>She's a damn therian...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>O-oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(I should've known...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(But...I can't afford to let this get me down!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>First, we'll head to the village that has been suffering monster attacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The wastelands nearby are supposed to be rife with the creatures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Recently they've gotten braver, and have started skulking around the edge of the village. It's only a matter of time before they assault the village proper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It is up to us to put down these monsters and restore peace to the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>All right, let's begin. Be on your guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>—————!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(W-was that a scream?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Dilga! Someone's being attacked!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You might not have heard it, but my ears are more sensitive than humans'. There was a scream coming from that direction!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Lead the way, Nina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>S-stay away! Stay back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Y-yes, I'm... Y-you're...! You're a therian!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I...um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(Just forget about it, Nina! Focus on what's most important here!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'll take care of this! Please, get yourselves to safety!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>R-right... Sorry about that. You saved our lives! Please, protect our village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Grrroooooorghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Captain! Another wave is coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>These numbers are far greater than what we expected. You there! Run back to the capital and call for reinforcements!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I want you and your knights to defend the village. The rest of the squadron will maintain a line of defense here with me. These fiends will not get past us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>As knights of the Envylian Guard, it is our duty to prevent any further harm from coming to these people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>For our nation and the people of this land!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Nina, I'm counting on you to support us. Fight well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Right! Y-you too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>We've taken out so many of them, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Grrroooooorghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Captain! We have sustained heavy losses. We should momentarily withdraw and regroup!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You idiot! What do you think will happen to the village if we withdraw? We must hold fast until reinforcements arrive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>But, sir—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>If I were to withdraw now and let this village be overrun by monsters, I would be breaking my oath to protect the people of this land and Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I would rather die than let that happen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Dilga...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What does being a therian have to do with anything? What should be protected in this world but the joy and laughter of the people—of all people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I will not stand by and watch someone's home be taken from them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Now, you run along, and don't worry about me. I'm not going to fall here! Gwahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I agree! We can't withdraw!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>We're the only people who can protect this village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>This village is someone's hometown! How would you feel if it was your hometown that was in danger? Would you stand by and watch it fall?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Th-that's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Stand fast! This is what you have been training for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>If you cannot even protect this village you're standing right in front of, how can you hope to protect the whole of Envylia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I will fight! Even if I'm left here to fight alone, I won't budge an inch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Hah. Well? Are your ears not burning with shame?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>The enemy has dwindled! Let's show them what our determination is made of!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Huzzzzzzaaaaaahhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Huzzaaah!</td>
</tr>
