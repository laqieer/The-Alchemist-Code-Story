<td>Why did you come? I told you not to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Go on! Say something! Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...I'm Mielikki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's not what I mean! Seriously! Do not follow me anymore! Understood? Got it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ouch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(I cut my leg...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(Sigh... I wonder why Ennis gets so mad.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hey, why are you still following me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh! Were you waiting for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Of course, I wasn't. Seriously. Wait there for a second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There were some useful herbs, so I went and got them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Gonna brew this for a second, and...here. Use this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You cut your leg on a blade of grass, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The vegetation in this forest is occasionally poisonous to repel monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You might be okay now, but there's a chance you'll have a fever tomorrow. Put this on your leg now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Th...thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Y-you don't need to thank me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hey...I want to play together with you, Ennis. Can I please go with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Sigh... That's what I thought it was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'll admit that you helped me, but I'm not responsible for taking care of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's bothersome to have you following me just because you're curious. I don't have time to waste on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Why? I don't really understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Isn't it more fun and better to be together instead of by ourselves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm not here to play around! Besides, it's not always better to be with others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I don't really understand that...but I want friends...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What is that? You're super annoying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huhhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Just because you don't understand something, is it too much to ask for you to see things from my perspective?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm sure you've never been betrayed or hurt before. That's why you're so insensitive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Friends are nothing more than a self-satisfying label. It's just an illusion. Ultimately, it's nothing but trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You end up betraying the other person or being betrayed by them. The only thing friendship does is muddle your perspective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What? If there's something you want to say then say it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I would never...betray you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Is that so? How noble of you. But when people die they die suddenly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huhhh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Let's just say we were to become friends. Let's also say that you promised me we would be together forever. If you suddenly died, you would be betraying me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If you have to say goodbye to someone eventually, I don't want to get close to them! I don't need friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ennis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Sigh... I feel a little less stressed after screaming. So? Did you put the medicine on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ye-yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>All right. Fine. You can do what you want from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh...then, I can go with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Even if I say you can't, you're going to follow me anyway, right? Just try not to die while you're at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>There's a lot of monsters, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>There's no way I can reach the nectar without taking care of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'll go. I said you can do what you want, but, if it gets dangerous, then run away immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>At least listen to me on that, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
