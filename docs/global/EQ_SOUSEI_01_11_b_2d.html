<td>Nimul, what was that just now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That...was likely one of the dragon's souls; one of its four cores.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>So there are three more of them, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Should be; assuming that the knowledge that was passed down to me as chief of the Sephira is accurate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Nimul! Something's coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I guess the damage we dealt to the dragon's core must have kick-started its defense mechanisms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Careful, Waginau. The beast will prioritize its survival above all else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Then you're saying that the Fallen aren't the only enemy we will have to contend with?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes... In a sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>From here on out, the corruption is going to be worse than anything you've ever seen. We will have to purify it as we go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Is there no other way? Our powers will be utterly drained...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tch! Where are all these Fallen coming from, anyway?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I...can only assume that they were once devoured by the dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't be stupid! I've never heard any tales of the Great Nidhogg eating people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>History doesn't tell all tales, Waginau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Besides... Do you even know where the Guardian Dragon came from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Of course I do! The Great Nidhogg was born unto Sephiron, just as we of the Sephiraâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>True, that is the legend that has been passed down in the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But the truth that has been whispered to the chiefs of our people, generation after generation... Now, that is a different story entirely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Our ancestors discovered Sephiron, and learned from her a technique with which they could seal the Cursed Beast. From there, our civilization began to develop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It was at this time, upon the dawn of the Sephira people, that a visitor flew in from outside of the Cosmic Egg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Nidhogg the Damned...who would later become known as the Guardian Dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Nidhogg descended upon the Sephira and burned the tower they had built to the ground. For years and years, war raged between the dragon and our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Eventually, when it became clear that there would be no end to the fighting if it was left to run its natural course, there came something of a truce. The dragon acknowledged our wisdom, as we acknowledged its might, and we forged a path of coexistence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>And so... The corpses of those the dragon killed over the course of countless battles are likely the Fallen we see before us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't understand... Why was this kept secret?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The dragon has always been a powerful being. Anyone would find themselves awestruck at a single glance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>And, as you now know, the dragon has not always been our ally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What if there were those among our people who feared it? This creature was once our enemy. How could we be certain that it would not turn on us again? Such doubts would not be unreasonable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>W-well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Doubt breeds dissent, and risks the resurgence of war. Even more frightening, perhaps the commotion would cause the Cursed Beast to stir from its slumber beneath the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>So it was decided that the truth would be kept secret. I believe that the chief who made this decision was very wise in his judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I...cannot say I disagree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>However...it was still a mistake. Concealing the truth leads only to its distortion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What was that, Nimul? Did you say something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No... Nothing. Anyway, we've wasted enough time here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Emmel might have been able to use the Matter to restrain the dragon, but she cannot hold it forever. Let's move on, quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
