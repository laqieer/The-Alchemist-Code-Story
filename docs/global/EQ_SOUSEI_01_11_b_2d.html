<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>

<td>What?!</td>

<td>Eventually, when it became clear that there would be no end to the fighting if it was left to run its natural course, there came something of a truce. The dragon acknowledged our wisdom, as we acknowledged its might, and we forged a path of coexistence.</td>
</tr>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>So it was decided that the truth would be kept secret. I believe that the chief who made this decision was very wise in his judgment.</td>
