<td>...Now for my super move! Entrance Cleaning Mecha!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wh-what the...? You gotta be kid...aghhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It worked! I'm glad I made it. Now all I need to do is press this button, and...there...an alarm should go out to the Peacekeepers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wow. You're well prepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We'll take it from here. Thank you for your cooperation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Glad to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You made that machine, Carol? But...I thought you were scared of machines... Even just earlier today...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Earlier today, I just got really surprised. Seriously! You don't get it, do you, Hazel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's all thanks to you that I can handle machines now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What? Re-really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's true that I hate the machines that killed my father and mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's why, when I woke up and found out I had to wear an artificial limb...it was awful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah... I can imagine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But...Vincent was there for me... You, too, Hazel... And you were also using prosthetics that Vincent had made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You supported me the whole time it took for me to get used to using my prosthetic limb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I knew how much more difficult it must've been for you, Hazel, with you having to use prosthetics for both of your legs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yet, you never showed that to me. You always just smiled and stood by my side. You are the one who gave me the strength to get this far, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Carol...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hazel, are you always going to see me as someone who needs protecting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I wish you'd also see how I'm able to smile now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't treat me like a younger sister...let me be your friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Friend...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes! If we're friends, when I mess up with the cooking, you have to complain about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Let me go shopping for cheese dogs with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But...Carol, something like what happened just now could occur again. Don't you understand that it's dangerous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Whether it be dangerous people or machines, I'll fight alongside you. I'll increase the number of Cleaning Mechas as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I may not be as strong as you, Hazel, but I won't give up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>As your friend...I can no longer let you fight on your own, while I stand around doing nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I guess "friends" would want to help each other when they're in trouble or in pain...wouldn't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes. I want to help my friend! So, please, let me face the same scary situations that you face...with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Heh...hahaha! You wanna put yourself in scary situations?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Consider me told, Carol! "Friends," huh? Maybe if you keep telling me off, we can become even closer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Keep telling you off?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I can do that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Right. Thank you, Carol. I look forward to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hey, you tried to pat me on the head again! Times like this call for a handshake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Fine...fine.</td>
