<td>Sieg, over here. Teacher was working on something before she left.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Roxanne holds up a loose stack of notes from a small working table in the backroom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The last dated entry was almost a fortnight ago. There are notes of "increasingly aggressive behavior of local wildlife", among other things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Sounds familiar. Sakris Village was plagued with them too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Does it say where she's gone, at least?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>There's a map of the area. Doesn't look like more than a few hours' travel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I don't know where this is, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Teach probably made a new discovery. Lustburg has a lot of uncharted territory on its fringes, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(Actually... it's more likely she stumbled into a new place after wandering the woods lost in thought...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Are we going to look for your teacher?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah. Hopefully she can shed some light on the situation. Both yours and the creatures'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Did you just lump Soren with these creatures?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I mean... he's a friend to animals, what with that little squirrel that lives in his clothes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, that makes sense. A squirrel whisperer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He looks just like them too. Cute and cuddly, with pinchable cheeks...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>And *I'm* the one comparing him to an animal...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>H-hey... I'm right here...</td>
