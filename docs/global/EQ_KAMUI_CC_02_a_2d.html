<td>Urgh... Where is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh! You're awake, Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Agatha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wait! Logi! Logi, Kamui's awake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Good. You were asleep for days. I didn't think we'd have a chance to talk before we left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We're in Eos? Is everyone safe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah, the civil war is finally coming to an end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Right now, Seriolde has stepped up as the heir apparent to the throne and is in charge of reconstructing the country as the next king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Dias... I mean, the Holy Guard won't get involved in the kingdom's internal affairs anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If that's the case, then this country is about to change drastically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ceclidis made a mess of this kingdom, burning its bridges to other nations and making its people victims of his ambition. I'm sure there will be more problems to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But finally, I feel like some weight's been lifted off my shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes, I know what you mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We, the Blue Tongues, are planning to leave this kingdom once the situation calms down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Do you have any leads?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No. There's so much information I gleaned here that I'm still trying to sort through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If we are to stay true to our ideals, where do we go from here? What battles do we still have to fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Everything is still unclear to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What about you, Kamui? What are you going to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ah... I don't know. I didn't even expect to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But I suspect I will be leaving this place soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I still have some debts to settle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Then why don't you come with us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Logi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I told you. I still have a lot to learn from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Besides, as long as we're trying to shed light on the darkness of this continent, we'll probably have to deal with the Sacred Stones again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>When the time comes, I'd like you nearby so I won't make the wrong choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No rush. I'm planning to stay in this kingdom for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'll come by to see you again. I hope you'll have an answer then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Leaving this kingdom, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yeah... That's exactly what I want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But before I leave, there's still something I need to do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>A few days later...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hm... It seems like I'm fully recovered now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>As I suspected, Sephiron's blessing no longer rests upon me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>From now on, I can't rely solely on Spiritbonding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Alchemy... I must deepen my understanding of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Grrrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The mayhem is over and the beasts are returning to their homes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>But I'm afraid I don't have anything to quench your hunger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but you'll have to look elsewhere!</td>
</tr>
