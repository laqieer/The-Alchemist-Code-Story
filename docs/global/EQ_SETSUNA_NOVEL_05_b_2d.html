<td>003</td>
<td>Uggrraaah!</td>

<td>Setsuna! The keeper's energy flow is... Setsuna, get down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Nngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I can't predict its movements...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Setsuna! Here it comes again! Wait... It's coming this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Grraaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No!</td>

<tr>

<td>Aaaahhh!</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Macherie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No... No... Aaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>How dare you! How dare you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I wont let anything be taken away from me again! Never again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Grrraaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Setsuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Macherie! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm fine! Oh no! Setsuna, get down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Setsuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Uggrraaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Jayme! It's coming this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I can't just watch her get hurt! I'm not going to just leave her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I know. Just be sure to dodge when I tell you to, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(I almost made the same horrible mistake again.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(Those two there are doing everything they can to help me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(While I was merely distancing myself from them, under the guise of protecting them...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Macherie! What do you see?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Setsuna! When the keeper was attacking, I saw a powerful flow of energy towards its chest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That must be where its core is. Its weakness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(The question is...will my blade reach it?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Setsuna! You can do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(Jayme believes in me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Now is not the time for me to hesitate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Setsuna...? Did she just smile?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Grrrraaaaaggh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Sorry it took me so long, but this is the end for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Uggrraaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(I am not alone anymore.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The sadness...the suffering...the anger... It's all a part of me, painful as it may be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>All I need to do is believe and fill myself with the desire to protect, just like Jayme does. Imbuing an honest desire into my blade...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>And here it is! Vagabond - Flawless Beauty!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Grrrooooooogh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Setsuna, you did it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Setsuna! I knew you could do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>My...strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>So you've delivered the jewel to the shrine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I have. Crafting a staff with that jewel will be the last of the preparations for the ritual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Everything is just perfect! This is all thanks to you, Setsuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>And the truth is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Oh, um... Hahaha... I told the Shrine Monarch about what happened in the ruins, and I got scolded pretty harshly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It's because I helped you when the trial was meant for you alone, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yea, but...the Shrine Monarch did say that being able to help others and accepting help when it is needed is a characteristic worthy of praise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I see. Then I suppose everything is all right, after all. Jayme will always be here to help you if needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yeah! And if I keep training with Setsuna, I'm gonna get super strong and be even more helpful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Yes, indeed. You might even become capable of using the same skill I did earlier better than I ever could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Setsuna, please don't flatter him so much. It'll go straight to his head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It's not flattery. I'm being honest. It was thanks to the two of you that I was even able to use it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Hehehehe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Sis, I'm really hungry. Can we have dinner as soon as we get home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Sure. Let's treat ourselves to a wonderful meal today! Setsuna, won't you join us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Of course. I would be delighted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>We're almost home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Jayme, no running!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It wasn't my power alone that allowed me to defeat the keeper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>But if I am able to perfect that skill...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Maybe I'll have the strength to protect the ones I love from now on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I lost my way once in pursuit of power. Now, I find myself in the same position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Am I making the same mistake all over again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Setsuna! Are you coming?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Sorry! I'll catch you up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>(There's no way for me to know yet whether this is a mistake or not.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>(The most important thing to me right now is that these two are happy to be with me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>(Then, one day...one day...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Welcome home, Setsuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Welcome home!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'm home.</td>
</tr>
