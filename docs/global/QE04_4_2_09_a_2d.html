<td>Tehre, how are you planning to reach its chest? And how can you be sure that's where the earth core is?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That is definitely its earth core. I can feel the power of earth resonating from it. Have you not noticed, Mocca?</td>

<td>If you recall the terrain of Saga, the answer should come to you.</td>

<td>The terrain of Saga?</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I see... Each of the cores is located in the same area as each of the temples in Saga!</td>

<td>In its stomach! So that's what you meant by the "terrain of Saga".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This land...really is one with its legend.</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's why I'm certain the earth core must be there in its chest. As for how I'm going to reach it... Haaaaaaargh!</td>

<td>So this is the dragon's interior, is it? It's different from what I had imagined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I thought it would be more like a living organism, but it seems to be...rather akin to some age-old ruin...</td>

<td>It...really does give off the same aura as the shadows we faced in the Trial. No matter. I've defeated you once before, and I have no intention of losing this time, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I will honor my side of our partnership, Georgios. Furthermore, as the Earth Sprite, I will destroy the earth core for the good of all Saga!</td>
