<td>You're not going anywhere! I will crack down on those who disturb the peace! Muscle Bringer!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Aghh...ack...you brute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's not brute force. It's the results that come from following the code of chivalry. It's something a guy like you who sits in the leader seat with his legs crossed in lethargy wouldn't understand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I've never missed a day of using a metal ratty instead of dumbbells to do 1 set of 999 times!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If you're going to call yourself a man of the sea, then you'd best make sure you can live up to that title!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Agh...ghh...</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>M-my pirate way is...nothing like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Dilga, thank you. You seem to have powered up immensely. Is it...because of that swimsuit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes. It's not so much the swimsuit, as what we at Wadatsumi call the heart of the warrior's way becoming aligned with my code of chivalry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I remember there being a warrior tribe in Saga that dressed in a similar way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The warrior's way, huh? Perhaps I should try wearing a loincloth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Indeed. I highly recommend it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Dilga is like super strong! Loincloths are totally amazing! I was in Wadatsumi, but I had no idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Rin, don't look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>A-ah, my next mission awaits me. I cannot waste time here. Farewell, Captain Vettel and the rest of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Mi-mission...Dilga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Idiot, don't stop him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>With his dazzling loincloth fluttering in the wind, Dilga gallantly walks away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Having defeated Gormalas, the pirate ship vanishes...and the monsters cease to appear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Thanks to the true man of the sea, Dilga, a peaceful summer vacation befalls the beach resort.</td>
