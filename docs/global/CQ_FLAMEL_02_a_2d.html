<td>Sigh... I wonder if the battle is finally over. That'll allow me to sleep for a while again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Flamel! I'm tired so let me touch the fluffiness again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hey, Melda! Don't bother me. I'm trying to take a nap!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I can't help it. There's nothing more fluffy than you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What do you mean, ‘you can't help it'? I don't understand you at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That being said, if you insist on refusing me the fluffiness, then you'll have to please me in other ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If you do that, I'll accept you as a man and listen to your request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Why do I have to do something like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Then I guess we'll stay like this. I've got no problem with that. Fluffy, fluffy, fluffiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Al-alright...then...I'll massage you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh? Try then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Okay. I heard humans do it like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Phew. Well? Do you feel a little more relaxed now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? I've been waiting for the massage to start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What?! I'm been doing my best to give you one all this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I see. Sorry. I thought you were just petting me all this time–not that it didn't feel good or anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ack... Well, what else can I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>When it comes to delicious meals...it's always brought to me by the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>As for songs...I don't really understand human ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hmm. What else can I do...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh! There you are Lord Flamel and Lady Melda!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You presence is urgently required as support!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What bad timing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh well.. let's take care of work first. I'll look forward to what comes after that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>O-okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>(What should I do? At this rate, she'll be stroking my fur forever.)</td>
