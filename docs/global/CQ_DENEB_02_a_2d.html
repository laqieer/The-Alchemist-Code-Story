<td>Phew. Finally finished!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>U-um...thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hm? Don't worry about it! It was a good training session.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But why were you in this alley on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Um...I was doing a little thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Thinking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I see... In other words, since your prediction was so accurate, he ended up resenting you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>And...how does that make you at fault? In fact, it speaks more to your amazing fortune-telling skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But...I'm sure that person didn't want to hear about a misfortunate future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If, by telling the future indicated by the stars, I end up hurting others like this, perhaps it would be best for me not to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hmm. Well, I don't really understand it all, but I don't think you should worry yourself over it too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Anyway, how about you go home and rest? I'll walk you there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Wow, what is this...? There's garbage all down the front of your house! Who did this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So, you're finally home, you fraudster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Thanks to your fortune-telling, my life is in shambles now. I'll have you take responsibility for your actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hey, you'd better keep your false accusations in check.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh? And who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The reason why you can't overcome your misfortunate future is because your heart is weak! Maybe you lack training?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The only person who can pave your destiny is you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Eve...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Shut up! You and your "guidance of the stars" nonsense! All your astrology does is make your customers anxious and afraid! You're just a fraud!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Please, enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Say what you like about me, but...I will not allow you toÂ ridicule the stars...or astrology!</td>
