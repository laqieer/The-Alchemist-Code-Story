<td>Lord Alvarez...we've received a report. It wasn't the gunslinger who abducted Miss Fiona...but the previously mentioned mercenary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...So things have finally been set into motion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Did you expect this development?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>In order to deceive your enemies, start with your allies. That's the human way of thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>He appears to have come in search of the Sacred Stone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So I thought it best to find out more about him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Never mind. Leave him loose for now. Meanwhile, run a thorough investigation on his identity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>W-wait...! Lord Alvarez, there's an intruder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>An intruder? Don't treat me as if I were some small-time criminal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh? Well, isn't this a welcoming guest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You should train your men better. If I wanted it, you'd be dead by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I expect better from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That being said, it could be troublesome for someone in my position to be seen with the boss of the underworld.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Nonsense. I know you'll be able to crush any rumors of this scale from getting out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>People don't even know about the train bombing, do they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I called on you countless times, yet you never came. What are you doing here now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Don't tell me that you're now considering lending me a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well...I came here to see what you're made of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What I'm made of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I've gotten to where I am through with the debt that I owe the former mayor...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That being said, it suddenly dawned on me that I don't know what your aim is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Every individual believes in their own form of justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Without knowing what you truly stand for, judging you based on my own preconceived perspective prevents me from making any true judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I see. So you wish to listen to what I have to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Something like that. What will happen to this world if it were entrusted to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Heh. If my ideal world were to come to fruition...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>All the evil that is rampant in this world will be wiped out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Are you talking about the Don Taras Family and me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No...I respect your position. How about we join forces?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Forget about something so insignificant as the head of the mafia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I promise you a position of much larger power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Unfortunately...I'm really not interested in things like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So you want to wipe out all evil, huh? In other words, only justice will remain in the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes. All meaningless sorrow will disappear. It will be a world of absolute ideals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>My justice will bring perfect peace to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I see. Well...thanks for your time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Wait... What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The world is a hot mess of good and evil. That's the way it's supposed to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Mayor Edward, who I loved and respected, tried to accept everything as it was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Your ideal world is...pathetic in comparison.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Let's go, Tango.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I will wipe out all evil from this world...including you.</td>
</tr>
