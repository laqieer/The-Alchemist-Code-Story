<td>Ha! I never expected to see Gluttony Foss covered in snow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>How long are we going to keep this up? We've already used a quarter of the drying agent we have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Keep firing! Don't stop until Kamui makes it to the base of that tree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are we...winning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Not bad at all for the first hand...but we do have to worry about our limited supply.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Just as Kamui said, speed is key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Either Kamui will drive a blade into my father, or we will run out of supplies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Exactly. Well, it looks like they made it. Hold your fire! Stand by until the next order!</td>

<td>Huff...huff... This is more tiring than I thought!</td>

<td>You defeated me once before. You dare say this is a more arduous task than that?</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Georgios! Are you finished already? You cleared out all of the Jam?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I told you they wouldn't be an issue...</td>

<td>Now is the chance to unleash my power upon our enemies. Please, give me the order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Me...? Order you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes. The one who ordered the invasion of Saga is no longer my king. He is no longer human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It is my duty to destroy the strong and gain power. I will gladly do so under your name.</td>
</tr>

<td>Understood. I, Seriolde Ceclidis IV, command you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Flame-Armed General Georgios, defeat Ceclidis, the first of his name, and bring my Marie safely back to me!</td>
