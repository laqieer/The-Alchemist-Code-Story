<td>In other words, safeguarding the origin of Alchemy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...is the true duty of the Protector. Is that correct, Lord Waginau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Exactly. This is why we must keep the village hidden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This is the true reason why the Sephira live apart from the rest of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The Sacred Stones are crystals of wisdom created by the Alchemy Source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Controlling and regulating such power requires Alchemy, which is also drawn from the Source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Therefore, the true duty of the Protector is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It is to protect the secret behind the original form of Alchemy, then pass on the gravity of that truth to future generations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Although the Sephira are indispensable guardians of Sephiron, they also carry the potential to destroy the natural order of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This is...a heavy burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It is your responsibility as a Sephira and as the Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This is the burden of living as a Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You must keep the true duty of the Protector hidden from the people at all costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Duly noted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You already have one hand on the door. It should not be long before you master this skill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Unfortunately, we are out of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The resurrection ceremony is a trying ritual for both the druidic priestess and the Protector. Do not let your inner darkness take hold of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What do youâ€”?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Kamui, you are especially talented. You stand out even among other Sephira born with such incredible Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>As a result, I suspect you are fated to encounter difficult obstacles in your life. Remember my teachings when the time comes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Do not forget, Sephiron and her door lie within you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I will keep that in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Then this is goodbye, my young pupil. I look forward to seeing you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Haaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Right flank! What's your situation?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We are holding for now, sir, but there are just too many of the Jam!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Anyone who is inflicted with the curse must retreat and be purified before returning to battle! I'll cover the gaps in our defense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Our druidic priestess is holding the ritual that will subdue the curse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We must buy her time! Today we put our pride as Sephira on the line and show the results of all of our training!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huzzzaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's it! We must stand our ground until those two can complete the ceremony!</td>
