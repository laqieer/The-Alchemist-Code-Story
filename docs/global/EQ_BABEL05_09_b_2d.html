<td>They must be absolved...as must I.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>A Few Days Earlier... Northern Pride - Inquisition Headquarters</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We will reaffirm our authority over the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're sending me to Lustburg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>There have been more than a few instances of inquisitors whom we have dispatched failing to return due to certain incidents occurring mid-mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ordinarily, such a thing would be unthinkable. Who could possibly best an inquisitor, when they possess both the status and power to bring justice down upon even the knights of the Holy Order?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No one should be able to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Unless, that is, they happen to possess the same powers of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The impact of the Lion Monarch's Charge has been immense. The world is unstable, and we have yet to truly recover.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I would say that that makes now the perfect time to adhere stringently to the rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The damage taken by the Holy Guard was, in a word, severe. We can expect that their reformation will take some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It is unfortunate, but the Holy Order of Babel is currently far from a united front.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This makes for the perfect foundation upon which excessive powers may run rampant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>As such, we will be sending you alone, Inquisitor, to monitor the actions of the Holy Guard. Make certain that they do not become aware of your presence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Your task is twofold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>First, you will infiltrate Lustburg and thoroughly investigate each and every Paladin for a fixed period of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Second, you will work to expose their true purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>And should another of these incidents take place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The Holy Guard must be held accountable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This is a good opportunity, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>To distance yourself from your parents' dishonor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Uncontrolled power.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Excessive power. Alchemy.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ravina has finally calmed down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Dear me! It has been a while since this last occurred. It was a rather large outburst, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(Her powers, too, are out of control.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Inquisitor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Y-yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>To pass judgment on others...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Such is my duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Have you never doubted your own judgments?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I would be lying if I said that I had not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Perhaps there is something that you have reconsidered regarding the purpose of Alchemy, and the current state of the Holy Guard, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Recent events have certainly given me a lot to think about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This young lady... Ravina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>She naturally possesses incredibly powerful magic and Alchemia Particles both.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>She was once isolated for these powers—which she has no control over—by the people of her village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>All that she had in this world was the kindness of her parents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>One day, however, monsters attacked her village, and as she attempted to protect her parents, she descended into a frenzied panic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Her magic overheated and exploded, destroying everything in the vicinity—the monsters, the village, and her parents, all at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ravina is young, but she feels the weight of the responsibility for her powers far more heavily upon her shoulders than most.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Not to mention the weight of the guilt that she yet feels for failing to control her powers that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>So please... Do not take Ravina's words from earlier to heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>She reminds me of someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Of myself, in fact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What are the Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Not long ago, while exploring some ruins, I found a document detailing secrets about the Sacred Stone Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Am I to be silenced if I speak on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Wh-what do you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'm not afraid anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I've already been killed once. There is no longer anything left for me to fear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I will learn the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I will protect this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What of the reparations I am owed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I received my mission from the Holy Order! I was merely carrying it out in secrecy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Y-you're an inquisitor, aren't you? The Alchemy we use is one and the same! We are both loyal disciples of the Holy Order of Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You must understand! Do you have any idea what will happen to me—and to you—if you—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>This secret you speak of... I am afraid that I know nothing about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I thought that might be your answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Yet you became a target...of the Holy Guard, no less, for learning that truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That's what it looks like to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>This is...troubling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>As an inquisitor who passes judgment on Alchemy and those who wield it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Don't you want to know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Are you trying to involve me in this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I suppose that would be sinful of me, wouldn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I would like you to accompany me—so long as you have no objections, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You're the only lead I have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Lady Lofia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I need to know why they killed me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I can never meet Milis again in this life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>That is...true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I accept your request as reasonable and just.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Whether it be within power, people, systems, or organizations... Where corruption festers, one cannot deny that some violent action may be required to suppress it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>There are rules for this very purpose, and I will follow them. I will pass judgment upon heresy and expose the darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Even should it lie within the organization of which I am part.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I'd like to hear more about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Sorry to interrupt. I was looking for my sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Identify yourself immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You want my name? Heh. You can call me Nyx.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>H-how did you get in here, young man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Anyway, since I'm here and all, I really wanna know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I wanna know about the future of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>To put it bluntly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I'm running out of time.</td>
</tr>
