<td>I'd have to say, I think it's the same as the secret to your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>When I think of my audience, my spirit extends out to my fingertips, and that makes my performance more precise.</td>

<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I think that's exactly the same as how thinking of making your fans happy makes you work harder and become stronger.</td>

<td>I see... I guess we really are a lot alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It certainly seems that way.</td>

<td>Knowing them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Please wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>

<td>038</td>
<td>Wow! So shiny and cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yes, you both look stellar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Th-thank you... Wedding attire seems so special that I'm still a little uncomfortable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But since we're aiding at such a wonderful event that brings people together, I suppose it's okay to get a little dressed up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes, I think so, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You're too kind...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Shayna, I owe you a debt of thanks, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Who? Me? What did I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Seeing how you think about your fans gave me a chance to think about my own feelings about dancing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>My dancing is dedicated to the happiness I want for others. That I am sure of and will no longer doubt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>If I didn't have confidence in that, I wouldn't be able to look in the eye those who love to watch me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Chihaya...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Thank you, Shayna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Would you allow me to perform a dance as a way of saying thanks and offering a prayer for the happiness of those at the fair?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>To make the most of my apparel, I'm incorporating the cuteness you talk about into my dance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It is thanks to you that I can now look at marriage in a positive light, so I wish to perform in this attire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Then I have a new dance I absolutely want to show to you.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
