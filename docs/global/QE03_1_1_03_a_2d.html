<td>It's just a rumor I picked up on recently, but apparently a man from Lustburg is gonna be visiting soon.</td>

<td>Really?! A foreigner? Are you sure it's not some kind of fake story? There's no way they'd let a man into the Royal Palace.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What it means is that the Royal Palace can't stop him from entering. After all, he's a Paladin.</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yep. It's not often that you get to see a foreigner man. Aren't you curious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Y-yeah. I wonder what kind of person he is.</td>

<td>Well, you won't be able to find out if you get eaten by these monsters. Come on, there's more approaching!</td>
</tr>
