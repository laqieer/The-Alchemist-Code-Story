<td>Rega should've made it back down safely by now. The area will probably be littered with Jam, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We've got our own fair share of Jam here, too! There's no end in sight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Georgios, can't you just use your power to take them all out in a single blow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My powers cannot be used just anywhere. Each use drains away some of my life force. We need to take these creatures out with old-fashioned grit and steel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It drains your life force?! Then why did you use it to save me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Reclaiming Beelzebub takes priority...and this isn't the time for talking!</td>

<td>The part of it that was glowing green must be around this area, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes, this should be it. Even if it's not the exact spot, as long we manage to get inside, it'll be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Then we've finally made it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We sure did. Georgios, you ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yikes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Careful! You wouldn't want to fall from this height! Well...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Muhahahaha! Feast your eyes on my strength! Behold the might of my clan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You cut its spine in half! The inside...doesn't look like the innards of a living, breathing creature at all. It's more like...the remnants of some ancient chamber.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's too dark to see anything. We won't be able to work out where the core is from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The answer is simple. If we can't see it from here, then we just need to venture inside and search. I'm going ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We should follow him. We don't know what dangers may lurk inside, so be ready for anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Whoa... What's with this place?! We should be inside a dragon...but this is too out there. I feel like I'm going to be sick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, it's not like we spend a lot of time inside of other living beings, let alone dragons...but you're right. I'm getting a bad vibe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We'll just have to bear it until we find the core. Where's Georgios gotten to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Graaaah! My blade isn't doing any damage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Georgios!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Is this the dragon's core?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Intruders! Leave this place! Leave at once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...?!</td>
