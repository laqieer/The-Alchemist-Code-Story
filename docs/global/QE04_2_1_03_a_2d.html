<td>In other words, it would make the most sense for the Gluttony troops to be there.</td>

<td>Also, Port Nahema is in the territory of the Tehre. It's Saga's base for trade where people from various countries and tribes come and go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>I see. Since they're merchants, they use the port as a base for their trade. But that almost seems like they're cooperating with Gluttony.</td>

<td>However, we are much closer to the Water Temple than they are. On top of that, I know this area like the back of my hand.</td>

<td>Voda is a calm and generous individual. She is not someone who would discard what we have to say for no reason. I'm sure it'll be okay.</td>

<td>Even as chief...I thought it was normal to only think of the Toxotes tribe.</td>

<tr>

<td>That's completely understandable. I wouldn't suddenly start thinking about all of Lustburg either.</td>

<td>Even as the blight within Mocca's body continues to grow, he thinks first about Saga.</td>

<td>Besides, when Mocca says something...no matter how difficult it may sound, I feel myself wanting to overcome any obstacles that stand in our way.</td>
