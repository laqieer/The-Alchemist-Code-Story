<td>Y-you'll pay for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm...not sure it counts as a threat if you're limping, and black and blue all over when you say it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Haaa... At least that's over with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ahhh! The deep blue! The salty sea breeze! It would have been so wonderful to feel it upon my living flesh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ahahahaha! You are all so full of life! I am the epitome of jealousy in this moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hee hee. Ooh, a six! I win!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hm? One more round? Well...all right. Will you tell me an interesting story, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What are you going to do, Liz? The Phantoms you summoned are enjoying the beach more than we are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Mmm... They've already turned me down, and they don't seem very dependable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If they want to have fun, who am I to stop them? It feels kinda wrong to try and force them to do what I say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Considering their desires won't get us anywhere. You're too soft, Liz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>She is, but it's also one of her strengths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hm? Speaking of which, where is that girl with the doll?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? I can't see her! Where did she go?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What is it? What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Dorothea is gone! Do either of you know where she is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh dear. I wasn't really looking at her, so I have no idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Was she not looking for someone? It stands to reason that she has trotted off to do just that. Clip, clop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I can't believe it! What's wrong with that girl?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>H-hey, Rebecca! Calm down, okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Why are you so calm?! She wanders off without saying a word, after you went to all the trouble of summoning her...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's incredibly disrespectful! If a student from our school did something like that, they would be scolded by a teacher for sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's it. I'm going to go find her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Finally! This is getting interesting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>W-wait up, you two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hmmmmmmmmmm... Mmmmmmmmmmmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hmph. He's not here, either. No! This can't be! Are we fated never to meet?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I found her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hey, you! What are you wandering around for?! You were summoned here to help Liz!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Do you realize that this is a restricted area?! Abandoning your duty to run around doing whatever you please... You should be ashamed of yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh, shut up! This doesn't concern you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh, really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What is your problem?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Look at that. They're at each other's throats. You can feel the heat from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wow, you're right! I mean—no! We have to stop them, Alma!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I guess. We can't do much from all the way over here, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But those two are actually...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Excuse me, but now that Dorothea has been found, we can return to the beach, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>H-huh?! We can't leave them here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Well, it doesn't change anything if I leave, does it? I don't want to miss out on my time at the beach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh, pretty please! I was just about to get some juicy information! Everyone is so relaxed, and so very chatty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I...guess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You should be grateful to Liz for summoning you! How can you ignore her?! You're a Phantom, are you not?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I am a young woman first, and a Phantom second! If you get in my way, I won't hesitate to knock you aside!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh, bring it on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, dear. Things are really heating up over there. What are you gonna do, Liz?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Nnnghh... I don't know what to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Grrrrraaaaarrrrrrrrgggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh, no! There are monsters headed for Rebecca and Dorothea—and they're huge! This is bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I guess they're the big boss monsters? They look kinda mad, too. Maybe they got up on the wrong side of the bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>This must be why it's a restricted area... Oops?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ngh! Rebecca! Dorothea! Look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrraaaaaarrrrrrrgggghhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Don't get in my way!</td>
</tr>
