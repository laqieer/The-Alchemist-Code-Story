<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(I was the strongest in my village, and everyone made sure I knew it.)</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(But...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Don't let them get away! Make sure they're all together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You can be rough, but don't kill them. We need the kids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Waaaahh! Help me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Let her go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmph. What if I don't want to? What's a kid like you going to do about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'll... I'll make you all leave! Hyaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Run! Quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Damn. Get that kid, you fools!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Haaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Tch. Not bad for a kid. I guess I should've expected as much from a therian. Except...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No matter how strong you may be, you can't beat all of us. Too bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Nnf, let go of me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What happened to all that bravery from before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Listen up, therians! Resist and the kid dies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Your blood will be used well. Now, follow what we say or—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>How interesting. How exactly were you planning on using the blood of therians?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Would you mind elaborating on that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I can imagine what most people would use Alchemia-rich therian blood for, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You?! Are you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You're all under arrest. Cover me, Courage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Of course. No one can outrun my gun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>W-wow... There's only two of them, but they aren't having any problem dealing with all those enemies...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hraaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's all right now. Are you hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I-I'm okay. You're really strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I couldn't do anything... All I did was put everyone in danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's not true. You saved that child, didn't you? You were very brave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's right. It's thanks to you rushing in that nothing worse happened to that other kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You just don't know how best to use your power yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>How to use my power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If I learn how to do that...can I be strong like you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(We left Saga soon after that, settling in Envylia.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(The people who attacked my village were arrested, but they were only the symptom of a deeper problem. The problem was far from being solved.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(Cheryl told us about Envylia and how therians could live there. After that, I became a knight.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(I wanted to learn how to use my strength, to be like the two who saved me that day. But in the end, I haven't changed at all.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(I wonder what's so different about D'Artagnan and I.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Let's protect everyone together, Yura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(Maybe her feelings of wanting to protect Envylia are stronger than mine? Somehow, I don't think that's the only reason.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Um, Commander Yura? Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hm? Oh, it's nothing. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh, Yura! Good to see you again. Patrolling again today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Not this time. Today, I'm investigating the recent incident with Vice-Captain D'Artagnan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Recent incident... Those people you chased away, are they coming back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>We can't discount the possibility. That's why we have to increase security to make sure everyone is safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I see... I can't help but worry. When I think of them attacking us again like that, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Agreed. This village has a lot of children and elderly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That's true...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Oh, I know! How about you all leave the forest and come stay in the city, close to the knights of this country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>D'Artagnan, don't you think that's—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>They would have trouble attacking you all right in front of the knights of Envylia! And it's way safer with a lot more people to keep an eye on the situation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It might do some good to interact with the humans there too. There may be some bad ones out there, but there are even more good ones!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>We know that all humans aren't evil. That doesn't mean that we can just forget the things that humans have done to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>D'Artagnan, I know you want to protect everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>But not many will accept living with humans so easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Oh... Yeah, you're right. Sorry, I got carried away, I guess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>None of you meant to hurt each other. D'Artagnan was just suggesting something, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>It's not your fault. You care more about the humans than us. It's not surprising you don't understand how we feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Care more about humans?! I've never thought about it like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>The Envylian knights protect all citizens, human or therian!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Excuse me, Vice-Captain. I have a report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Right, you were the ones pursuing the criminals. Welcome back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I know you're all worried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>But we'll solve this, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Unfortunately, we were unable to catch the targets. However, we did find something during our pursuit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>We believe they're fragments of the incantation gear they were using. They may be of use in the investigation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Thank you. Feel anything, Yura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>There's a small amount of remaining Alchemia. We could trace them using this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Wow! That's amazing, Yura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>That's why you were always the best tracker in training! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
