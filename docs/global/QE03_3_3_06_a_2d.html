<td>Heheh! What do you think? I'm pretty strong when I want to be, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Aghh...uggh!!! Impossible...I've never seen such...haphazard magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Liz, how are you feeling? Were you able to rest a little?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes! Thank you, both of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>All right, then let's hurry on ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I think the prison is in the basement. I didn't see any prison while we were making our way to the queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Let's start by searching for stairs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Liz, did you find any?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There are too many doors! I can't find any!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We need to search everywhere! Where's Rebecca?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Aghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Eeeek?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Re-Rebecca?! Did you get rid of them on your own?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well...um...the enemy didn't have any armor on so it was easy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Th-thanks! I managed to not get turned into an insect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No way...is that the Succubus Ritual? No...it can't be. I mean...that...that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Rebecca...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Give her some time to recuperate, Liz. Let's search for the stairs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh? He-hey, Alma?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This door is suspicious...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's tinged with magic. I think if we touch it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Whoa! All these letters came floating up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's a code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If we use these letters to make a password, the door will unlock. I have something similar in my house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Rebecca! Are you okay now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...Yes, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The problem is the password. If this is connected to the prison, then the queen must have chosen the password.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>There they are! It's Lisbeth and the others! Catch them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The pursuers are already here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You two, handle them! I'll take care of the unlocking the key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh?! Can you open it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I have about 10 possible ideas in my head. I'll try all of them! Buy me some time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I-I don't really understand, but all right!</td>
