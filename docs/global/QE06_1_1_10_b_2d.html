<td>Sorry to gather you all to this remote base right after the banquet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Enough with the formalities. Get to the point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Our scouts report that one of the pure-blood demons, the Hidden Ogre, has been sighted in the castle town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Then the one who attacked the Second Squad disguised as you was—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Most likely the Hidden Ogre.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I see. Any news on its current whereabouts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Nothing. They have been unable to pick up its trail after losing sight of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We should take care of it before it can do serious harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Won't it make its way to Castle Aquila Rubrum eventually? We are its ultimate target, are we not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Are the demons after something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Seems so. The demons have definitely begun targeting Castle Aquila Rubrum specifically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Any ideas why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>None at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hm. I was really hoping you would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Me particularly? Why is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm originally from Greed Dike. Considering its history with Wadatsumi, I wouldn't be surprised if people absolutely hated me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But I cast off the shackles of the past and now dedicate myself to the betterment of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So I want to see the threat of demons eradicated. I only regret that I can do nothing more than provide support.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I understand how deeply passionate you are about this issue. We absolutely will rid Wadatsumi of demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That's good to hear. I honestly believe it was the best decision to make you the Blade Fox's commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We the people of Greed Dike have long wished peace for Wadatsumi as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>In fact, it is something I wished for personally. You need not say any thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I still would like to thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If you find out anything at all, please let me know, for Wadatsumi's sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Even if the Hidden Ogre is headed towards this castle, we shouldn't just stand around and wait for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Indeed. We don't know the extent of the damage it could cause on his way here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We should go to where it was sighted tomorrow morning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's the plan. Make sure every soldier is on heightened alert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>This Hidden Ogre will be a foe unlike any we've ever faced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Demons in castle town?! Could this have something to do with the Hidden Ogre?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Captain Tanosuke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Let's hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Second Squad, follow me! Azami, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You better not die on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Back at you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We may have lost the initiative here. Tanosuke, I'm counting on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I've got this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>First Squad, accompany Tanosuke on this mission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What about you, Celis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'll hold the fort here. I can't let this castle fall while everybody's out after the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Got it! Captain Tanosuke, wait up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>All right, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>No! P-please, it wasn't me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Shut up! I know you're the one that killed my son!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I swear, it wasn't me! Believe me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Screw you! There's no way I can— Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>If none of you will believe me, I'll... I'll just kill you all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What...is this...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>This is Hell.</td>
