<td>Amane!!!</td>

<td>What are you...? That power of yours...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Hmph. I shall spare you. Come with me. It is futile to resist.</td>

<td>Huzzzaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Humans... They truly are confounding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>We still don't know what the result of our resistance will be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's right, Amane. And besides—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I can't stand by and let my little sister do all the work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Then allow me to bring the end result to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>One of you will be devoured by me, and the other will be taken home to be dissected!</td>

<td>You're wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Live through this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Grrraaaaaarrrrrgghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I am Celis of the Blade Fox Corps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You...!</td>
