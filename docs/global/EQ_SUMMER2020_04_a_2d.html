<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Those Alkaroids also headed for the beach, it seems. The other Alkaroids probably have the same goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Someone is commanding them to do this. But why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There's no point in scratching our heads and thinking about this here! We must act first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Noah? What are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Darn. These Alkaroids don't have Albea's comb either...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You were concerned about it for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That comb is special to you, right? Then we have to get it back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's not true. It's a regular comb you could buy anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That may be true, but what's important about it is how you feel about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Like the silver spoon I always have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Your silver spoon? What is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Oh, I don't have it now. Emma is carrying it for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Polishing a silver spoon calms me down. So whenever I get annoyed, Emma always casually hands it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Then Pamela made it cuter by putting some decorations on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It was just a regular item you can buy at any store, but now it's a special item filled with our memories together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's why even if it's nothing special to someone else, it's something precious to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see. You all really are close! The two of them should've been on this team with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah, but... I've been feeling a bit spoiled by them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In the back of my head I would always think that even if I get mad, Emma will be there. That's not good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's why this time I wanted to be on another team where I can't lean on the two of them. I want to become a more pulled together me for them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wonderful... That's wonderful of you, Noah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>N-no, it's not. I mean, it's not going well, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I still get mad quickly and then you come in and help me. It's not going as I hoped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's why I'm not wonderful or anything at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No, you are wonderful. Taking that first step is important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Besides, there was a time when I too trained hard to become strong enough to protect another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You too, Suzuka?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If you keep that person's face in mind as you train, you'll put more into your training than you would have by just training by yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I believe that when you intentionally try to become stronger for someone, that is when you will grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So if you strongly wish to grow for your friends, I'm sure that you will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Suzuka!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>For someone else, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(I became a mechanic because I like machines.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(I took up my father's mantle and became repair shop Magbea's proprietor.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(I decided that I had to keep a place for my brother to return to.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(I've done nothing but chase after my brother. It's all for my brother...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Albea, something came for you too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wow! A single rose and a beautiful comb! That's so cool! Well done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(A comb... How...did...? Only my mother should've known that I used...a white buffalo comb...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Could it have been...my brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hey, Albea. It's just like Noah said, isn't it? That comb is very important to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It really is. It's a comb that you can buy anywhere, but my brother gave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>So it is super important! Why didn't you say so earlier?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I had no idea it was that precious! I would have looked harder if I knew that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Right?! We have to find something that important! Does it have any special characteristics?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Umm... In dark places like this cave...if it gets hit with light, it'll give off a white glow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I see... In that case, it'll be easier to find if it's in here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Yes, but the octopuses are carrying things out of the cave right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Albea's comb might be mixed in with all the garbage outside. Let's search there later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Yeah... Let's deal with the Alkaroid problem and then take our time searching for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It glows white, huh? ...Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>The octopuses are gathering... That looks gross...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>There! Look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Are those...pirates? Why are they here? And why are the Alkaroids...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Weird... They're not collecting materials at all. I thought that if I left it to Slothstein's machines, they'd gather it quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>When we picked them from the wreck, I was sure we'd scored something great. But the things they're picking up are terrible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It actually feels like we're losing more than we gain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Well, we'll have them search the beach a little longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>So they're the ones sending the Alkaroids to the beach!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Grrahck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hm? They're acting a little weird... Hey, oi! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Heads up!</td>
</tr>
