<td>Your cooking is as brilliant as ever, Luce!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That is... Your knife technique, anyway!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You think so? I do get a sense of that myself, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh, you do? I mean, not just anyone can make a vegetable soup that comes out quite this color, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>There is...much room for improvement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If you really feel that way, why not direct the brunt of your focus toward your bridal training?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You're the queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You've no reason to wield a knife, let alone a sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Besides, you've got me—as well as the entire order of the Knights of Envylia—to protect you, should push come to shove.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So, you know... You can afford to spend more time on your bridal training. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You don't need to worry about me, Leoniaz. I will become a splendid bride in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Is that so? Then I challenge you to cook me something that I can call delectable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You will push me to choose the way of the knife over the way of the sword until the bitter end, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Luce... We've been through this. Cooking skills can be considered part of your bridal training. Swordsmanship cannot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Very well. I suppose I will first need to go and collect the necessary ingredients for the recipe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What, right now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I think wild game would be better than fish... All right. The forest it is, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hold on a second! There are rumors going around that a gang of thieves has been haunting the outskirts of Envylia of late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You may remain here. I am going to prepare for you a meal that will satisfy you until your dying days!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Luce, wait! I'm coming with...you. She's gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What am I going to do with her? I guess stubbornness comes with the crown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The venison roast I had the other day was scrumptious. I don't see any deer around here, though. Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Is that you, Leoniaz?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's definitely her voice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't come this way! Turn around! Behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Phew! That was a close one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>There was a monster right behind you, Luce!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Then I am in your debt, Leoniaz. Thank you. You saved my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Don't thank me yet. Looks like it had friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Here they come! Get behind me, Luce!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'll bathe my blade in your blood, you fiends!</td>
