<td>I see, memory loss. That must be difficult for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Erm, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Alright! I will help you reclaim your memory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I've lived in this city since I was born, so I have plenty of connections.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>R-really?! Thank you Ms. Teona!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Leave it to me! Then—and just to be clear, my help isn't contingent on this or anything—but I expect another match with you, Kam—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You won that fight, Teona. Is it not unseemly for you to continue challenging me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I have my pride as a gladiator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You let me win that match, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If so, I did not intend it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>No, I am sure of it. Call it intuition, but you had some means of defeating me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It seemed to me that you held yourself back for some particular reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You make too much of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I have fought many capable warriors in my time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Though they all had their own particular strengths, they had one thing in common.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Their aura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Their...aura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, it's like...a sense of them interrupting or anticipating my moves, or—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Whatever! There's just something about them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Did Kamui have that too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hisham.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yes. Right before that last clash, I sensed something about to change the course of our match.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I still haven't overcome that sensation, and I refuse to call myself the true Champion until I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I see. So it's a matter of pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm glad you understand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes, and I refuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>W-wait, what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I have other things to attend to while I am here. I appreciate your assistance with Hisham's situation, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I am not his guardian. We are little more than passengers heading in the same direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I can help along the way, but I cannot see him through to the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Even though you seem so invested in his well-being?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It is difficult not to care for one who is going through what I, myself, have experienced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Wha—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I, too, have lost my home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Does that mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It was a natural disaster in my case. The sand swallowed everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I had distant relatives that took me in and I live in their village now, but I can understand what Hisham is going through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I see. I am sorry to hear that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Kamui, you're...the same as me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>So, um, Master Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>A letter was sent here for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ah, thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I have business to tend to. Teona, if it is not too much to ask, I would appreciate if you could watch Hisham for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huh? Uh, sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Forgive me. I will return before nightfall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>He's gone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh, and don't worry. I promise I will help look into your past, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We can look for your parents together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>No, it's fine. I doubt they'll be in this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hisham?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I just know somehow. This place just doesn't sound right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Sound...right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I didn't expect to hear from you so soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Ceclidis is currently busy organizing troops to subdue the southern forces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It should now be possible to see the King in secret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>All right then. Lead me there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Kamui. It is good to see you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I am honored to be granted an audience with you, King Narol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>There is no need for such formalities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>There is nobody else here but us, two men troubled by the same problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You are too kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I, Kamui of the Sephira, have come to answer your request to purify Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>As I suspected, the seals holding Beelzebub and its preemptive curse are weakening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Exactly. After being sealed, it seemed little more than a mere stone, but recently it has begun faintly emitting light from time to time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>If the seal is broken... I do not wish to even try to imagine the horrors it may bring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>The Sacred Stone is this country's symbol. In addition, Beelzebub is deeply tied to the Alchemia of this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>If this civil war lingers on and the anguish of the people continues to grow, even Sephiron may not be able to maintain her seal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>All of this has come of my failure to be worthy of my position. Not only that, but I have brought hardship to my people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>For now, let us purify Beelzebub. The stone, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Mmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>It seems the purifying energy alone is not enough to purify the stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Stay back, Your Highness! That is the manifestation of Beelzebub's power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>In other words, the avatar of the preemptive curse!</td>
</tr>
