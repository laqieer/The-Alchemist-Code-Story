<td>D-darn it! Why?! We're the ones who are right! How could we lose?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You leave me no choice! I'm gonna bring down a giant snowstorm and bury you all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hahahaha! Here I go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh?</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Nothing's happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wh-what's going on?! We're snow spirits! The snow is ours to control!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You have been so focused on your tiny view of what is right that it has blinded you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Wh-what did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The purpose of your powers is to allow you to protect the Winter Holiday, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yet you are no longer fighting for the Winter Holiday, because you have forgotten its true meaning. Have a look around you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Th-the Maruda children and...humans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Whoa! Your snowman is kinda different lookin'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh? Is it really that strange?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No, it's not strange! I've just never seen one like it before. It's new—but I think it's cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hey! Let's decorate the trees together after this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Is the Winter Holiday not meant to be a time when children can have fun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's so nice when it snows and the green trees get all pretty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Do you understand what is important now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Y-you're right. The Winter Holiday is meant to be for the children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We were wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You get it now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Just don't go making the same mistake twice, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What have you two got to be all high-and-mighty about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Now, then. All that is left is to make it snow. Klima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Can you really do it, Klima? Even the snowmen couldn't do it just now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Have no fear! Klima's power, coupled with all of the hopes and dreams of this holiday, should make light work of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Not to mention that this is the village of the guardians of the Winter Holiday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Go on, Klima. Pitch your love for the Winter Holiday to the sky! Don't worry—I shall support you with my prayers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'll do my best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Maybe she's too tired?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I-I'm fine, don't worry. Nnngghhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Klima. Think back on when you were young.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Those warm, kind memories of the Winter Holiday... You had so much fun, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I did. It was so much fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Everyone was smiling, and the air was full of excitement. The snow was really beautiful, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That does sound lovely. Will you show me? I want to see that wonderfully festive landscape with my own eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>O-okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I want to show it to you. The snow was so pretty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's snowing!</td>

<td>We're finished with all the preparations. This party is ready to roll!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Wow! Thank you both so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What's with all the snowmen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The Maruda Tribe wanted to see what our Winter Holiday was all about, and since we kinda made friends with them, we decided to bring them along. I-is that okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It's not a problem, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Wow! Cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What a weird snowman! It's so funny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Awww... The children are gonna get all caught up in the wrong Winter Holiday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Don't be like that! All that matters is that they're having fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Wow! The snowmen are moving! This is so cool! The Winter Holiday is the best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Come on, snowmen! Let's play together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The Winter Holiday is about giving children the most wonderful day possible. As adults, it is our responsibility to ensure that that happens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Klima, you should go join in with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>C-can I? Aren't there still things left to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Oh, you needn't worry about that. The preparations are all but done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>That's right! You've been really good, Klima!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I-I have? So then, maybe... Santa might come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hmm... It would be nice if he did. Yes, I am confident that he will visit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>We wish all the children of the world a happy Winter Holiday!</td>
