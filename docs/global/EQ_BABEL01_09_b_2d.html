<td>Tsk! You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We've destroyed your ring. Looks...like we made the right choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Heh heh... I may have underestimated you a little. You, in particular... If it weren't for your injuries, we could have some real fun. Too bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Too bad...? I think it is more accurate...to say you are lucky my...injuries give you a glimmer of...hope!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Ha! Well, I'll let it slide. You did have a lucky break with the ring. Unfortunately, I have an appointment, so...it's time for me to wrap things up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I've got a date with your country! To hack it to pieces, of course... I'm sorry to abandon you like this, but I'll leave a few immortal soldiers to keep you company.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I don't know what you people...are planning, but whatever it is...the Scarlet Flame Guard will stand...in your way. For Envylia. For...the entire world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Please. Look at yourself. You're barely holding it together and you still think you can stop us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Barely holding it together...? Ha... What is death? Even if I die...my iron will stands strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>My vow will live on...in the Scarlet Flame Guard! We...will win in the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>A test of endurance...? My specialty! I'm intrigued to see who will win!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm a little bitter that you managed to smash through my Ring Guard - Black Flames...but I think that half of my immortal soldiers should be enough to bury you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmph. Feels like I'm leaving the job half done, but... Well. Can't be helped. Toodles! Enjoy the last moments of your life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Urgh... Agh...</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sir Gerald!</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ren... Take Nina and leave this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...What will you do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'll stop them on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You got a death wish? Lame. What happened to Smile Protection Guild or whatever? You know that this is going to cause the opposite of joy for a bunch of people, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Someone has to do it...and if it has to be anybody...it should be...me. Go, Ren. We'll settle our grudge...another time...all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That ain't gonna happen any time soon! You... Ugh. You make me sick. Always taking the short straw for yourself! You're the worst!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's my justice, my...legacy. An...iron will...that will never...be broken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ren... I'm not dying...for the therians. I'm...dying for me...the way I choose... My iron...will...leading me to a...glorious, blazing...end...and turning...to steel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tell everyone...what I said! Nina... You...will inherit my legacy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Sir Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I just...can't beat you... Exceeding...expectations...to the...very end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Tch. I guess I'll never really have the chance to show you up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I wanted to be the one who bested you, the one who finally took your life. This sucks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmph... Go. Hurry! I leave the Scarlet Flame...Guard to...you, Nina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Vettel... How are things going...over by the palace?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Things have calmed down somewhat now that the reinforcements from the Holy Guard are here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So I thought I would check on things over your way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But never mind that, Gerald. What the heck are you doing? What are you doing there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Natalie... I thought I...told you to stay...back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What?! As if I could just leave you behind with those injuries! Get over here! I'm going to heal you, like it or not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No. Natalie. Fall back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No! I won't! I won't leave you behind! How could you?! How dare you ask me to do something like that?! Why do you think I worked so hard to improve my healing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It was all for you! You're such a stubborn, stupid idiot! You just never let me heal you, always going off on your own and taking everything on your own shoulders until you are buried by it all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You never ask for help, never let anyone help! What am I supposed to do with you? What...? What am I supposed to do without you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Natalie... Natalie, stop... You... You have your...own honor left... Let me have mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You are so thick-skulled! My honor... My reason for everything...has always been to be at your side, to support you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Natalie... You were...always at my side...healing me. Making...it so that...I could focus all...my energies on...defeating the enemy...before me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Find...a...new...reason...to live. Live...for...me...Natalie. Live...and let go...of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Sir Gerald! I-I'll never forget you! I will carry your convictions with me forever! The Scarlet Flame Guard will never lose the heart you gave it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>"We shall not allow ourselves to be blind to the plight of those who can be saved. There is no prejudice in the Scarlet Flame Guard. Respect none who wield the sword without heart."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>"Dedicate your sword...to the pursuit of...justice..." Nina... This shall...be your creed, your code...of honor to live by... Remember it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Remember! Remember that you...are the sun that gives...joy and hope! Never let soften...your iron will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Sir Gerald!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Gerald, it's too early to give up! I still need you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Haha... No, you don't...my old friend. Go on, Vettel...Natalie... I leave this world...to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>We swore to defend...the setting Scarlet...and hold in our hearts...the Flames to manifest our iron wills!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>We are...the wielders of the Scarlet Flame!</td>
