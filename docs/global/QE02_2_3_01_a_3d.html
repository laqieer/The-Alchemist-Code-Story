<td>Not cool...brah...gi...gigaga...! You...did this to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>For-forget my orders, brah! I...I'm gonna go all out and blowing this station to pieces!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Co-come on, gunslinger! Let's go out together with a bang, brah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The station too, huh? Even for a final death wish, that's going too far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Wh-who's there, brah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I won't allow innocent people to get caught up in this. I'm sorry.</td>

<td>Gi...giga... Yo-you, brah...! You...newb...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh no! The locomotive is leaving the station!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Squeak! Guard Droid detected! Guard Droid detected!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Numerous armed androids are shooting at us! We've got to stop them, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Tsk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You all right, little lady?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Y-yes! Bu-but the locomotive...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ack. It's not over yet. Alkemono, check if there is any road that overlaps with the tracks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Armed androids closing in! Armed androids closing in! They've locked in on us, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We won't let them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Alkemono, quickly find a route!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tsk! You gotta be kidding me! No way are we gonna give up so easily!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh no! It's pulling away little by little!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Even if we continue to run parallel like this, it won't get us any where!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Alkemono, have you found a road that intersects with the railway?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Aye, there's a large intersection 3 km ahead! The railway crosses under an overpass!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And after that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The next is 8 km ahead, aye! But, before that, there's the Redington River!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We'll have to take a detour to cross to the opposite shore, aye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If we take a detour there's no way we can catch up. That makes the overpass 3 km ahead our last chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Can we make it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We have to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Don't worry. I pride myself in my ability to make calculated adjustments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You just think of what to say to Ethan when you're reunited with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Squeak! Guard Droids detected! Guard Droids detected! They're trying to shut down the road!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>As if we'd let them! Let's ride this through at full speed!</td>
