<td>There's nothing for us to talk about. Hurry back to your Water Temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hehehe. You were always an easy boy to read. The more stubbornly you try to protect something, the more you hold it inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why now? Do you mean to tell me that those children managed to move you somehow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Indeed. That girl...Tina... She's the one I've long waited for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The one that you've...long waited for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So, this is...the Water Temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ack... Those Gluttony scum, they've invaded quicker than I anticipated. Hurry, we must take Voda away from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh? Didn't you just send them packing, Tina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes, but it doesn't change the fact that they've caught up with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Visitors? What a rare treat. What brings you here, girls?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Voda, I am Tina, the newly appointed 45th chief of the Toxotes tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The Toxotes tribe...? I'm sorry to hear about Adone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I didn't know Voda was such a...beautiful person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He-hey! Lisbeth! You're being too forward...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hehe... It feels good to be complimented. That being said, daughter of a foreign land, I have lived many times more than you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Whaaat?! I can't tell at all! I've come from Lustburg. My name is Lisbeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Lisbeth! Please. Restrain yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's fine. Women appreciate compliments no matter how old they get. So, what business do you have with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Voda...I received a vision during my Ritual of Baptism.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I saw the...horrifying future of Saga...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I saw the land burning, people clashing...and a giant dragon descending upon the land of Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>A dragon...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I also witnessed another vision of late. It was of you, Voda, losing your life at the hands of Georgios.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I have come here in order to change the future revealed to me through my vision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Voda, I implore you to hear my request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Would you please come with us? The Gluttony army is closing in on this place. Your life is in danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...And where would we go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>To Fuu's base at Lilithâ€™s Hill. Voda, this is for the sake of Saga's future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Saga's future...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes. We wish for you to ask Fuu for reinforcements...that's how dangerous the approaching enemy is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Georgios the Flame-Armed General, who leads the Gluttony army...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>He also killed my father Adone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What?! I see. I didn't think Adone was one who could be easily defeated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Furthermore, my friend who is indispensable to the future of Saga has been infected by the Jam's blight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>He is also in the Fuu faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>So, you want me to help this friend of yours. What do you mean when you say he is "indispensable to the future of Saga"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>He is a Wind Shaman. He holds the key to reviving the power of the wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>A Wind Shaman...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Look how far they've managed to come! ...Haaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Tina! There's a lot of them outside as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We can't let them get near Voda! Voda, please on hold for a moment. First, we'll annihilate the Jam!</td>
</tr>
