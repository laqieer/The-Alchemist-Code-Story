<td>Tsk. You're pushing yourself too hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hm? What's the matter? You've gone quiet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Your smithy was burnt down. As someone from the same nobility as the ones who did this, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh? You've suddenly gone all meek on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Observing that noble, I simply became aware of my own immaturity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I was almost doing the same thing as that noble with my one-sided demands for you to create me a weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hurry back with me to my manor. I will immediately present you with one of my forges.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What are you playing at? Will you ask for me to give you a weapon in exchange?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Of course not. Don't mock me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Then what is your motive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If you insist on knowing, I want to apologize for everything up until now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Additionally, I want to pay back the common folk who have suffered under the whims of the aristocrats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It would be horrible just to walk off now. I couldn't do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>When you started berating that noble, I wondered what had gotten into you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Fww...fwahahah! I see. For all your craziness, you can actually string together a decent sentence or two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It looks like I read you wrong. It turns out you're actually the good kind of an idiot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hey! Don't call me an idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I've taken a liking to you. Fine. I'll go with you to your manor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It looks like there's more to you than I initially assumed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Heh...heheh! Of course! I'm not a shallow individual that's easily understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>By living near me, you'll be able to understand me on a more personal level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Also, I have a name. It's Rosa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Eventually, I will conquer the gods themselves...so remember my name!</td>
