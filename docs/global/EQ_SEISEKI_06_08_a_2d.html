<td>Amazing! These are the sacred tools used by the legendary blacksmith!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>With these, you can start the restoration of Excalibur, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No, I'll need something else too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The damage done to Excalibur is so great, that this Philosopher's Stone won't do to completely restore it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What? Then what are we supposed to do? Kagura is in grave danger. We don't have any time left!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Calm down. Do you think we'd have come here if there was no hope?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...!<br>Do we have an alternative then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes. Rather than making up for the lack of Philosopher's Stone, we'll use the ultimate resource, which is overflowing with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If we combine this with Excalibur, we should be able to give birth to the ultimate version of the Holy Sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Umm, what do you mean with the ultimate resource?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That one.<br>The Guren Blade which Cadanova entrusted to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh?<br>Captain Cadanova's sword?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Guren Blade possesses an overwhelming energy which far surpasses this Philosopher's Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If we were able to merge it with Excalibur...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>it would most definitely bring forth the most powerful sword in the whole world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's just that this does involve a big risk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>A risk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The essence of Guren Blade's overwhelming energy is a power of darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If this power of darkness were to suppress Excalibur's power of light...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>in the worst case, it could erase Excalibur from existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What?!<br>Is that really possible?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There is hope though.<br>It all depends on your ability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>My ability?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Right. If you were able to suppress the chaotic power of darkness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>we should be able to merge these two blades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>In other words...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>the faith of the Holy Sword Excalibur rests completely on your shoulders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Let me warn you though.<br>Even if things go well, there are no guarantees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If all conditions are met, our chances of restoring Excalibur would be about fifty-fifty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>When you say that Kanon could suppress the power of darkness, I suppose that in the worst case, the opposite could happen too, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What would happen if Kanon were to get overwhelmed by the power of darkness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I suppose you're aware how that Kudanstein guy had changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I would like to use the sword you entrusted to me, in order to restore the Holy Sword Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>In order to save Kagura, my comrade. You wouldn't mind, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Kanon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I will do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>If we want to save Kagura, and in order to create a future for all of us, we don't have any other option!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Well said. But be assured. These swords we're about to merge are Zain's and Cadanova's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Their mutual friendship will definitely bind these swords together. Come on, let's get this once-in-a-lifetime gamble started!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Huh?!<br>W-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Hey... what's happening outside? Did the monsters come to bring us some water?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Well... there's not too many of them though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Tsk! Why now at this crucial time?! Let's go, Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>No, you have a task to fulfill, don't you? This is a job for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huh? Do you really intend to fight those monsters alone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hey, who do you think I am? I am Chloe, a knight of the Scarlet Flame Guard. Do you really think those monsters could possibly take me out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Come on, don't get in my way now! This is a great opportunity for me to shine, and to earn plenty of Lord Vettel's praise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You need to save as much of your energy as you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You should accept her offer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Alright then.<br>Good luck, Chloe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>This is a serious situation after all. Isn't your task way more important than mine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Please just don't mess this up in some clumsy fashion, alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Chloe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Come on, let's get things started here too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh?! W-what's up with these numbers?! There's much more of them than I anticipated!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>A-and there's still more coming?! I could really be getting myself in trouble here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Let's do this!<br>Show some spirit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I'm ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...Right.<br>Kanon is putting herself on the line as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I can't possibly run away either! Please, Lord Vettel! Lend me your strength!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Huh?! The monsters just got blown away?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>That's where they're restoring Excalibur, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Spica?! W-wait!<br>What about Seida and Captain Monzein?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>My apologies, but I didn't have time for idle talk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Oh man...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I will never let you get past me!<br>I will stop you right here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Chloe of the Scarlet Flame Guard... You also had a part in killing Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Tsk! Is it us you're after? Or are you after Excalibur?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I came here for you two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>As long as I don't get to know more about you two, I cannot judge whether I should steal Excalibur or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>“If Excalibur is left in the Holy Guard's hands, the world will be ruled by chaos.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>That's what Lord Zahar said.<br>Whether that statement is true or not...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>also in order to make that judgment, I want to get to know you two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You want to get to know us? You didn't come here to exact revenge?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Vettel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You called out this name to ask for strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>That Vettel... would that be Captain Vettel from the Scarlet Flame Guard, who opposed Lord Zahar at every single turn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Exactly. Whenever I'm facing a tough situation, I always try to imagine what Lord Vettel would do. I highly respect him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You don't mind that I called his name, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You respect him?<br>I can feel some other feelings in your words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Could it be that you are in love with Vettel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What?! W-why would that concern you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>We must be quite similar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I'm the same as you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I also always find myself wondering what Lord Zahar would have done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>It's true that your relation to Zahar may be similar to my relation to Lord Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>But even though we're similar, you managed to succeed where I failed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I was unable to stop Lord Zahar, but you succeeded in that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I wonder why that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Why I was able to stop him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I want to know the reason for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Tsk...<br>At any rate, I will not allow you to approach Kanon.</td>
</tr>
