<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Is this true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. I've since sent Nina to scout things out. There hasn't been any major commotion yet, but unease is spreading across the country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ugh! What could the Wratharis army be planning?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are the garrisoned troops on the border merely an attempt to rile us up, or are they a diversion for something bigger?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We're all still on edge after the Lion Monarch's Charge... We could very well be overthinking this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Still, there might be some meaning behind their presence, whether it be a provocation or a diversion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Not knowing their true aim is rather ominous, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There's not much to say at this point. Let's wait for Nina's report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Is she all right? Work has really piled up on her since she became vice-captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You're looking pretty tired, too, Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes, but with the Blue Flame Guard practically out of commission, we have to pick up the slack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's hard, but we have to do all that we can for Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We're back! It doesn't look like they're moving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We can't afford to start anything, but for the sake of our people's peace of mind, we can't just leave them be, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm moving out. We will observe the Wratharis army, and keep them in check.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Should you really be the one to go? If something should happen elsewhere...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's right! What are we supposed to do if it was just a distraction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>If my presence can help calm the tension, then I must go. Besides, you'll be fine without me. You have Nina here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If it turns out to be a distraction, then Vice-Captain Nina will take the lead. I know that can trust her to take care of things while I am gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Isn't that right, Nina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>O-of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The rest is up to you. See you soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'll do my best! Oof...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hey! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Quiet, Victor. You're going to scare her. Are you all right, Nina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>S-sorry. I'm fine. I just got a little dizzy, that's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't overdo it. Haven't you been pushing yourself too hard of late? All that work you've been doing on top of training...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Your body is your most important asset. Don't destroy it by being reckless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You're wrong! If I collapse after this amount of work, that's just proof that my determination wasn't strong enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I have to keep going! I have to try harder!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This stubbornness... You really are turning into himâ€”which means that it's pointless for me to argue with you. Here, drink this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? I will do my part by healing your wounds, just as I used to do for Gerald.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Not that you're injured, but here... He used to drink this a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This drink restores stamina, you see. It should help you push on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Wow! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Heheh... I've continued to improve upon it, over and over and over again, and now the effects are simply outstanding! Heheheheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Is this what a mad scientist looks like?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Report! An army other than the garrisoned Wratharis army appears to be marching on Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>According to our information, it appears to be a detached force from the Wratharis army! Awaiting your command!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Which direction are they approaching from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>They're not coming from the west where Captain Vettel is! They're advancing through the Desert Zone to our northern border!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>There are a lot of therian villages out that way! They're going to get caught up in this if we don't hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>So the stationed troops were a decoy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Those jerks! They're using our ongoing restoration as an opportunity to invade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Nina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I understand. We're going to mobilize our remaining knights and move out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Natalie, secure a supply route. Victor, ready the troops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Sound judgment, and delivered so quickly... We're counting on you, Vice-Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Nina, what should I...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I need you to stay here, Chloe. Please. For me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Stay...? Why?! I can fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>There's doubt in your sword arm right now. We can't afford to take someone with so much doubt along with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That's not true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I've noticed, Chloe. As Vice-Captain, I watch everyone carefully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Respect none who wield the sword without heart. I think that you would have a hard time standing on the battlefield right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>No, that's... That's not true! I have no doubts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>If that's the case, then show me here and now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>N-Nina...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Sorry for requesting this so suddenly, but I think it's something Sir Gerald would have done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>If you are truly free of doubts, then as one who bears the scarlet flame, I want you to prove it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>If you can't do that, then you're staying here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>In this state...you would just be putting yourself and everyone else in danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Fine! I'll show you!</td>
</tr>
