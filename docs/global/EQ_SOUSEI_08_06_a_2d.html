<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>So, you've come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Dinner's ready, but it doesn't look like any of you are particularly hungry right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Shahel, we're here to stop you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That look in your eyes... I presume my daughter has already told you, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Told you that the land of Superbia Belt will serve as the seat of sacrifice for the Ceremony of Creation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You must realize that everyone who lives here chose this path for themselves. They desire to be sacrificed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I've allowed all those who don't to leave. They are free to move to other regions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So tell me. What separates the express consent of these people from your resolve to sacrifice yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If anything, the recreation of the world has the highest chance of yielding a flourishing future. In the long term, it may even prove the safer and more humane option for all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Even if that's true, the ends do not justify the means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I see you use emotion rather than logic to make your decisions. Unfortunately, I have no emotional appeal with which I can refute you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I couldn't even if I wished it, for I have no heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You don't...have a heart? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Exactly what I said. Of course, I'm referring only to myself. Helene's different, as are the other high elves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's just a bit of a special quirk I have. I am a direct creation of the dragons, so I suppose you could call my literal heartlessness something of a prototyping defect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But both Ignacio and Helene have cited you as possessing a deep love for your people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I am merely imitating a certain man when I do that. A man who was willing to give up everything, including his own child, to fulfill the Ceremony of Creation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Lord Shahel, allow us to take care of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No, I will fight as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It is nearly time to conduct the Ceremony. The only piece that remains to be placed is the chosen one, whose arrival in Superbia Belt will signal the beginning of the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We cannot afford to be stopped here... Is that not the case?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It is as you say, Sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Father...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You understand, Helene, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes. I believe in the choice I have made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This is the moment to fulfill the promise that those of Superbia Belt all agreed upon—the promise to trust in the true path and walk along it without doubt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But I don't want this region's people to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It may be their wish, but it isn't mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ignacio?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well... I don't have much of an opinion on this Ceremony either way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But I can at least say this much: I don't intend to allow my sister to kill you. You understand my meaning, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Of course, my dear son. I'm so glad that you've grown up to be such a caring, compassionate young man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>"Dear son," huh? I feel like you've always just been coddling me with that, and it's made my trigger finger a little stiffer than it used to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Do forgive me. As I said, I'm merely imitating another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Quence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Sorry. It was my intent from the very beginning to abandon ship partway through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Honestly, it pleases me—inasmuch as I can be pleased—to know you've found something to believe in. You've always been so negative, I expected you'd achieve very little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You've also been most unpleasant to be around, as a result. You're a rather nasty sort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>All right, let's just kill this guy already! I think we can all agree he's not good for much of anything anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Child, you are not the chosen one, but I still believe in your potential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Now, let me witness the moment a human brings down a dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
</tr>
