<td>002</td>
<td>Someone help. Woody...old man...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Jeez. I guess I take second place to Woody. Oh well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Old man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You're safe. Honestly, don't do that to yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You're a kid. It's best that you act like one and hide behind my back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well...I want to be useful to everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Jeez... You're really similar to my sister in that way as well</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You have a sister, old man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes...but I haven't seen her in a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I abandoned both Alchemy and my family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Whatever you might think of me now, I used to be called a genius Alchemist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But I got sick of it halfway through. After all, Alchemy can only create fake results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>In order to achieve true results, you have to achieve it with your own two hands. That's why I discarded Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>My family had placed their hopes in my talent of becoming an Alchemist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's why we ended up drifting apart, and that was that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Old man...that's not good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Mia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You're amazing, old man, so hang in there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Both Woody and I believed that you would come save us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I was really surprised by the magic you showed me before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You're not a fake, old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>For me, both you and Woody are real.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(I wonder why I cared so much about what was fake and what was real.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(After all, they're just tools that can be used to bring about results.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(If it can be used to protect someone or make them smile...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(That's right. I first started learning Alchemy, because I wanted to make my little sister smile.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Mia, thank you. Woody, help us out as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm going to rethink the way that I use this power. I'm going to try facing myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I appreciate you providing me with this opportunity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Old man...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Just...one thing: I'm not an old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>All right, got it, Magnus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Seriously...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Even her smile is just like my sister's.)</td>
