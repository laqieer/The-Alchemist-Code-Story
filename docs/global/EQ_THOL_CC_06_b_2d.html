<td>Most villains that appear in stories, I've noticed, repeatedly challenge foes that have defeated them before.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Even if they know there is no chance to win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That, I do not understand.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Simply dreaming of change will accomplish nothing.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>

<td>Further than anyone ever has, my prodigy child will charge ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That is how he will show his true talents.</td>

<td>Will I...die?</td>

<td>If the group you organized cannot defeat even me alone, then yes, eventually.</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It would mean that overturning the world is a goal far beyond your reach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I guess I wasted my time offering myself up as compensation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I figured that was what you'd done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So you knew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I guessed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I chose it, but if there's no prospect of getting reimbursed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>All of this was futile?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Probably.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Thanks for counting to ten.</td>

<td>Aaargh! Screw this board game! What is up with these pieces?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>It freakin' flipped!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>It's called Promotion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Promotion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Some pieces can be promoted if they invade deep into enemy territory. They essentially power up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Well, you're using some words I've never heard you use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Promoted pieces are turned over, and they may have the power to change the flow of battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What do you mean, "may"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Different pieces move differently. It all depends on how they're used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well, that's it right there. I just can't be bothered to remember how each piece moves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Such a tedious game.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You do remember the faces of the Templars, do you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Even those who are no more?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>If we don't remember them, who the hell would?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Besides, none of them were pieces of some game.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Indeed. However, if seen from far above, we are all but warriors and pieces of an active battlefield. You, too, are a piece. Not the player.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Even me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>No, you are the piece that has the potential to change the flow of battle upon the board.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>

<td>There is a saying that insists the bishop is more effective than the flying chariot in early game.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Huh... Bishop? Which of these was it again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It has flipped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Oh, right. What does it become?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It becomes the Dragon Horse. By making it deep into enemy territory...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>One can become a dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Cool, right?</td>
