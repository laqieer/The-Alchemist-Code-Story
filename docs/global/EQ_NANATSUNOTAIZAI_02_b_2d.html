<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Grrooooooohh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But why didn't my powers affect it at all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Maybe the Alchemia they've been absorbing had something to do with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Alchemia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's, uh... Well, to put it simply, it's like the fuel source for everything in this world. It's used to power Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We aren't people of this time, but Alchemy allows us to fight on as Phantom Soldiers for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Phantom Soldiers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Phantoms are the transmuted souls of those who have passed away, materialized through Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What?! Are you two already dead?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Bonds that are woven together beyond death... This world and its natural order refuse to let me depart peacefully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>None of us know what you're trying to say!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So the Albions are stronger because they've been absorbing the Alchemia of this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It was surely Alchemia that resonated from the hulking darkness. So whispers the darkness within me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Would you mind telling us what that monster we just fought was? Also, who exactly you two are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, how rude of me! We forgot to introduce ourselves. My name is Elizabeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm Hawk, the captain of the Knights of Leftover Disposal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>How peculiar. A talking pig. Are you of some cursed species?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No, I am not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Anyway, how did you end up here, Elizabeth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh, we're just gonna move on? Fine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, I can only tell you what I know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Demons... Ten Commandments...and The Seven Deadly Sins...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Nations crowned with the names of sin... This encounter of ours was an inevitability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So I guess we should look for your friends first, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No... I can't just leave those who are suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Meliodas... The Seven Deadly Sins should come to us after they hear of trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Let's first do what we can for those who are suffering. I'm sure that's what he would say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Meliodas...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So you also have someone that you believe in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes. He is someone very dear to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It was inevitable that I would be the one summoned here... So whispers the darkness within me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That darkness within you has a lot to say, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Helping these people... Helping your people is the least we could do to repay you for helping us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Thanks! I knew you were a good person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hehehe, th-thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hm. I did not expect you to be summoned here as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It can't be...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Zeldris!</td>
