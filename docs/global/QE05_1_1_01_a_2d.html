<td>There was once a pillar on the Continent of Babel that ensured stability in these lands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>A tree that cradled the dawn, mother to all... Its name, remembered in legend and passed down from generation to generation, was Sephiron, the Tree of Life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The first time I heard the name of this tree shrouded in mystery and ancient wisdom, upon which sprouted the roots for all civilization—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>—was when I was still but a young child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Without a home, I drifted like a vagrant, death trailing behind me until I was rescued.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Sephiran people were an elusive tribe that protected Sephiron by hiding her and themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>They nourished me back to life, reminded me of the joy of seeing a new day, and gave me a new mission to live for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>My mission. That's right. That was my sole purpose in life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Then why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Why am I not dead? Why do I live on, carrying the shame of having failed in my mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>O Mother Sephiron, what is it that you ask of me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Where...? Where am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No, I...I know this place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Is that you, great Sephiron? So you have not yet been lost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Please! Send me a sign! Show me what path is left for me to follow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I humbly beg of you, please show me the way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What do we have here? I didn't expect to find such a juicy catch while fishing through such pitiable wails and lamentations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Who goes there? You are trespassing on the hallowed ground of Sephiron!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see. You must be one of the Protectors. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that you would make such an assumption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I am Ouroboros. I am the bond between truth and the world, the Observer of Destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ouroboros? What do you mean by "the bond between truth and the world"?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>A beautiful reaction, Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This proves to me that your tribe has chosen the proper successor to the position of Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But all that has now come to an end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What is that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The Sephira have guided these lands for over a thousand years...but all that has now come to an end with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>An end...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes. An inevitability of this world is that those defeated lose what has been passed on to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Is that not how you humans have built the histories of this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Then why am I here? Why was I summoned before the Door of Truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I myself wish to see that question answered. Is it simply chance, or perhaps...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Your spirit is a mere ember of what it was. As you are now, you cannot blaze a new trail for the future, let alone bring the threads of the past together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Remember, Protector, how harsh the path you have taken to come here has been.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What sweet memories of the past have you lost? What joys and moments of peace have been stripped away? What future has been crushed by forces you could not control?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What you seek lies in the answers to those questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Remember...? I was... Wait... Why was I wandering the desert all alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Very good... Now we will see how brightly might you shine once you have regained your memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Show me the flame that you once were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It all started when...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I was heading out to the royal capital of Gluttony as I had been commanded...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The history of the Sacred Stones is littered with sagas of fools who went in search for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The devastation of Envylia, the upheaval in Slothstein, and the Lustburg incident...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>All of these are little more than a desperate attempt to extend a history of human dominance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The resurrection of the dragon at Saga was a harsh reminder to the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>A reminder of the danger of Alchemy, with its ability to resurrect beings of ancient legends, and of the Sacred Stones, which hold within them the power to topple the existing world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What exactly is Alchemy? Where does it come from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The start of it all, where people first mastered the forbidden art, the land where it all began...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Gluttony, the nation where the Sacred Stones were lost and yet flourished thanks to the acts of humankind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Mankind's Will is at the mere mercy of the Stones of Gods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Chapter 5: Immortal Sin, For Whom...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Pleh! I got sand in my mouth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The storm is getting worse! Are you sure we should keep going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What do ya think? You wanna get caught by the rebels? A sandstorm is nothing compared to the southern army of Gluttony!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>These rebels, they're that bad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Oh yeah. North, South, they're all the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Problem is, I sell wholesale to the North, so getting spotted by the South can get a bit troublesome, to say the least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It's why I have to go through the trouble of borrowing this alchemic carriage from Slothstein and forcing my way through this sandstorm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I apologize if we have been an extra burden on your journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Aw, nah, you already paid me for the fare. I ain't got objections.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But, uh, you sure about taking that kid with ya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>If I'm being straight with ya, it doesn't pay to be sentimental.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>A kid like that with no relatives to speak of... The best he can expect is to become a slave or a vagrant. It ain't a pretty sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I appreciate your wisdom. Even so, to ignore the situation entirely would weigh far more heavily on my conscience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Well... It's your decision. It certainly ain't any of my business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Well, look at that! There's the royal capital, Eos, the jewel of Gluttony Foss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Um... Is that, um, the place you wanted to go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Yes. We have arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>So that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Many people and goods come together in that city. We may be able to find a clue that will help unlock your memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Are you prepared for your journey, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yes, Chief. Let me assure you that I will be sure to conduct myself appropriately as the representative of our people, the Sephira, and as the prospective successor to the title of Protector—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Take a breath, my boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>The journey to the royal capital will be a harsh one. You won't last long out there if you don't relax a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You need not worry. I am confident that you have all the qualities necessary to represent the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>With the sephirah upon you and the skills you have learned in this village, you will find your way without issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Thank you, Chief. Then, I shall take comfort in my faith that Sephiron guides me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Indeed. Be sure to pay your respects to His Majesty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Wait, wait, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Haaa... Whew! Kamui, you were about to leave without a word again, weren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Father! You should have told me that Kamui's departure was to be moved up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Hrmm, that was... I'm sorry, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>You forgot, didn't you? Really, you can be so thoughtless about anything beyond your own duties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Fine, fine! I have nothing more to say. Malta, I will leave it to you to walk him out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Are you really going, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Yes, it is an honor for me to have been charged with this duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>As if! You just want to see and travel the outside, don't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>N-no, that's not—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You know you can't fool me! Your brow furrows when you try to lie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Really? I should be more careful about that then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>No fair, Kamui... I wish I could see what the outside world looks like, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>The outside is a dangerous place. You're the village's priestess. We can't afford to have you walking around out there without a guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I know, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Malta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Alright, fine. I'll be a good girl and wait here, but in return...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I know. I'll get you a souvenir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Good! But also... Please be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I know that Gluttony's going through a civil war between the North and South. Isidore is really concerned about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I am aware of the situation, but I expect that it won't hinder me from carrying out my duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>If you say so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Thank you for walking me out. I will see you soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Okay. Soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>The desert has come so close to the village... The desertification just keeps spreading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>The industrialization and exploitation of the natural resources really has changed this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>What in the world is to become of Gluttony Foss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Hmm. Perhaps I should get out of the desert before worrying about the fates of countries...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>It's so far to the royal capital. I hope I can find a caravan along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>—ody... Help—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>A child's voice?! Followed by...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Grrrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>They must be under attack from desert beasts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Ah! Aaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme! From the void comes the infinite! From the infinite, may there be light!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>"Aurora formed in glory, fell my foes with flames of mercilessness!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Gyarr?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Wha—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Stay back and stay still! The beasts will give chase if you run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
