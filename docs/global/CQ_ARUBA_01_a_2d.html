</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Agh...! No...that's not the point...</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Seriously...you're an idiot, Aruba!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hey! Chiruru! Seriously. What's gotten into her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Why is she so stubborn today? What difference does it make between today and tomorrow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
