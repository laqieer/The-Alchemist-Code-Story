<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>U-urgh... K-Kagura... Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I see. You unleashed your phoenix to envelope and suppress the blast to minimize the damage. Clever trick, redhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Gnngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hey... You okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Haaa... I don't need your little comments. There's no way you can be allowed to do as you please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, really? What a bold proclamation. Who is going to stop me? You?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Nngh... Don't underestimate us. This fight...has only just begun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Urk... We will stop you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I won't allow your attacks to destroy our determination to bring you down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Same here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Dear me. I certainly hadn't intended to offend. You understand me, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tsk. You're always stealing my thunder. That was my line!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Grk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>T-Templars?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Unfortunately for you, I will never let you lay a single finger on Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Seriously, I got here first! How dare you try to hog the spotlight! They're my prey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, well, well. It looks like you'll be busy without me. Such a shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Y-you... Don't get cocky just because a couple of your friends showed up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The flames of our justice will not be dampened by such an obstacle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Really? It seems your comrades feel differently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Sol a-and those two...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No... Wh-what should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>H-hey! Don't let me down like this now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>They, unlike you, understand how outmatched you all are. You cannot win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hey! Hey!!! This is no time to panic! There're only two more people to defeat than before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Shut up for a second, would you?! Kanon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yes, I know. We can't defeat them in a straight fight. If they all come at us at once...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>That's quite the idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Neun, Acht, don't we owe them a farewell gift? I think fulfilling this last..."request" of theirs would fit the bill perfectly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh no! Get ready, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Pitiful creatures, it's too late! The outcome of this battle was determined the moment we stepped foot on—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Grrr... You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ha! I'm not going to let you get away! Let's fight! Yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Victor! I told you not to get ahead of yourself and run off like that! Why don't you ever listen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Chloe?! How...? Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We rushed over here as soon as we subdued the Greed Dike soldiers in Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Basheeny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Knights from Lustburg and Gluttony Foss should be on their way here as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>If we can hold out until they arrive, we should have a chance to pull through to victory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Lord Commander! I apologize for the breach in protocol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Allow me to formerly request permission for the Scarlet Flame Guard of Envylia to join this battle at your side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Captain Vettel! We would be honored to have you and your knights aid us in battle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Victor, I hope you have learned from this. We are a knight order that has come to represent our country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>There are certain formalities that must be observed before we just charge in with our swords swinging.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes, Captain Vettel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>This is our chance to get revenge for Captain Monzein! Let's show him what we can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Acht?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>We won't let you take a single step toward any of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Nnrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You thought you could just forget about us, did you? We already warned you! If you want to get at them, you'll have to get past us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Miuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Sorry about that, Kanon. I didn't mean to let her get away. I'll take her down here instead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Thank you, Spica! You must have had a hard time holding her back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Chloe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Lord Commander Kanon, reinforcements are coming from the other countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Yes, I heard that from Basheeny. Thank you, Kazahaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hey. You heard that, right? Once all of our forces have combined, you won't have any chance of winning!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You should give up now, while you still can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yeah! We've got all these amazing, famous fighters here! You're going down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>How wonderful. I didn't realize that such illustrious heroes had come to participate in our little tete-a-tete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What the heck, man? You've been fighting them without even realizing how awesome they are? I can give you a quick summary of everyone if you like—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Victor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Sol...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Yes, Acht. You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>They're all here...which means that if we kill everyone here, this country will crumble in their wake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Lord Commander Kanon, please be careful! That man...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I know. Don't worry, Basheeny. I have a plan. I will stop him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Acht. Neun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What's up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Let's show these interlopers that they are outclassed, no matter how many people they try to throw at us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Heheh... This is going to be fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>This battle will be the anchor for the future we have been striving for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>We shall wage our own holy war against the skies that have weighed so heavily upon us and crush the world that has tried to grind us into the ground!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>They've started their charge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>We will stop you! Come on, Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Fools...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Shouldn't you have figured it out already? This type of fighting is my specialty. Crumbling Armor Hand!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Spica, watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Nice try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>What—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Nghh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I don't wish to interfere, but this is a dangerous enemy. I believe that we would all be better off working together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Hmph. I have no objection to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Solid Destruction Axe!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Urgh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Nngh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Agh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>One, two, or three... No matter how many of you there are, you will never defeat me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Nngh... Even three of us is not enough?! It can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Oh man, oh man... This guy's strength is unbelievable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>All of us combined still can't stop him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Get out of my way, worthless grunts! No one less than a Captain can even hope to stand against me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Then, why don't you try your hand against me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Huh? Who're you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>If three challengers are not enough, perhaps four will suit you better. If you don't mind, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I probably should have been a little more exact with my words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Urgh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Hrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Nngh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I meant that anyone less than a Captain of the Holy Guard cannot hope to stand against me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Is there no limit to his power?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Nngh... Y-you... Don't you underestimate the Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Well, well. What happened to your absolute justice? I seem to recall you saying something about stopping me...or have you given up already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Agh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Bring as many people as you want. I will show all of them that fate itself has chosen me to lead the way into the future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>You and your little armies are nothing more than specks among the dust of history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>You are all just remnants of an obsolete world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I will destroy you here and the whole world will recognize its rightful leader!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I may not know much, but I know that whoever that may be...isn't you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>After all, were you not saying that you will send us all into the next world within three minutes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>People are not fools enough to believe in someone who is all talk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Please. Did you think I wouldn't notice you gearing up to try to take me down? You too, redhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Plasma Burst!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Urk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Nngh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Hrgh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Sorry if I led you to think I'm all talk. Let me follow through with my promise to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>A-Argh! Y-you... Even my powers of darkness cannot damage him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Th-that's ridiculous... How can he be so untouchable?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>This is the end for you. Neun, Acht... The time is upon us. Wipe them all from this earth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>What? Wait, but I haven't had my fun yet! There's just nothing like the satisfaction of crushing my opponent with my own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Is it not enough for you that I recognize you as the strongest of them all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>If you dally around here, you might miss the moment that the legendary power returns to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Tch. Well, I guess there's nothing for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>However, would it not be wise to conserve our strength here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>It's fine. Orion is only one man. Rather than strength, it is time that is of the essence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Wh-what is that black light?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>It's him... Above his head, a ball of black light is...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>He's amassing some kind of energy. What an ominous light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Just looking at it sends shivers down my spine. What would it do if it actually touched the ground?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Kazahaya! We must tell everyone in Northern Pride to evacuate immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>That would be a pointless endeavor. The shockwaves of my Cursed Sun will reach all who reside in this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>In a few moments, this country will be wiped from the face of the planet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Don't worry. Death will come gently. Everyone will have time to reflect thoroughly on their lives until this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>W-wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Transform into scorched earth, Northern Pride!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>H-he unleashed it?! Is this the end?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Urk! Huzzahhhhhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Huzzahhhhhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Kanon! Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Now, where do you think you're going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Grk... Get out of my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>I will not allow you to interfere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Let go of me! Let go! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Finally... Finally, this limitless blue sky is ours for the taking! A new age is upon us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>No! Have we truly run out of options to stop this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>N-no... Is this really how it must end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>It can't be... We have lost and learned so much... Struggled until we had the strength to face our enemy... Could it all have been for naught?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Is this really to end with our inability to fulfill the hopes and dreams of all of those who came together to save Babel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Nothing has changed! Nothing has been resolved! This can't be the end for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Please, Excalibur!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Whoa! What's that light?! Is that...the light at the end of the tunnel? Am I dead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>No, that light... It's Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>That sword! It's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Excalibur is...glowing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>How unlike you, Kanon. You were really never the type to pray for your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Twin Fang God Wolf!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>That's—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>What...? Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Wow. Rude. I went through all the trouble of getting myself here, just so I could have the last laugh. Don't ruin this for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Ill Atmosphere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Nngh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Hey, Kanon! You look well. Healthy. How's the battle going? I didn't mean to just drop in like this, but I kinda have to return the favor to this guy here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Even in my eternal rest, I couldn't rest in peace. Literally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>C-Captain Othima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Captain Othima, I must apologize. You have given me an opening which I shall now take advantage of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Agh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>I promise you, this is just the beginning. We still have quite a lot to repay you for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Seida?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Urk?! Grr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Wh-what is this? Restless spirits come to settle their regrets?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Ha... Don't make me laugh. You can rise from the dead as many times as you want to fight me. The outcome will always be the same!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Hey, now. I dunno if you really want to waste your time yelling at us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>You dare—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>Dare what? I'm just saying, we're not the ones who are most upset about this whole thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Hey... I don't know if I appreciate the way you have phrased that. I am no sore loser.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>I personally feel that such pettiness is beneath me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>Y-you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Captain Yauras?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>In fact, I would like to clarify that my good manners simply will not let me disappear without making sure I make myself clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>To that end... I swear to you that I will make you pay a thousand times over! Eternal Rose!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Aghh...!</td>
