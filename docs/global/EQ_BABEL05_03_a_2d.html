<td>A Road in Lustburg</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The snow is already piling up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(Deneb...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(This fortuneteller is known for being incredibly precise. She divined my brother's whereabouts for me once.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(She might be able to tell me more; this time in more detail...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(But...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(I can't seem to bring myself to even knock on her door.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The snow is piling up, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Goodness! What pretty hair you have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ah, um, I'm s-sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Are you here to see Deneb?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I am sorry, but Deneb is going to be on holiday for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Her store is closed, in fact, although I am tending it today in her absence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Would you like some tea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Deneb is all right, isn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>She is. I am afraid that I can't tell you where she is, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Th-that's...fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh? What is this? A telescope?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Could you...give this to Deneb for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Tell her I said thank you, and that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm finally getting close to an answer, and will do my best to find it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'd better get going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wait! Hold on a moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Wh-what is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Is your name...Albea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Achoo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You've been out in the cold for a while, haven't you? Here. Have some nice, warm tea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Th-thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I haven't introduced myself yet, have I? My name is Sophia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Is something the matter? Is something on my...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's just... You keep playing with your hair, as if you're...trying to cover your ears, or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, that! It's just a silly habit of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>P-please excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>N-no, I'm sorry! I worry about my hair, too. I shouldn't have—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I've heard about you from Deneb. She said that someday, a pink light would come to look anew upon the stars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So she was expecting me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You're exactly as she described. Look at that large contraption on your back! You really like machines, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh, this? This is something my father left me. We made it together, actually. I prefer miniature ones myself, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It must be awfully important to you. Do you carry it with you everywhere?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It requires a huge amount of Alchemia to function, so I can't power it on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>There's just someone who I...really want to show it to, whether it's working or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Is that where you're headed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'm looking for my older brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ah, yes. Deneb told me that you asked her to divine his location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What brought you back here, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well, it's just... I'm not sure anymore. I feel like I'm getting closer to my brother, but apparently that's dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I've come this far, and if it was just me, I wouldn't mind getting involved in something risky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It's when I think about dragging someone else into harm's way that I get scared. I didn't know I could feel so...afraid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Thank you for the tea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Are you leaving already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I don't want to trouble you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Albea. Look at me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Th-those are...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Elf ears!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You needn't worry about putting me in harm's way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Wh-what do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Elves have very good hearing, you see. Not only that, but we are a people who have been on the verge of being oppressed and used for selfish gain many times over. If nothing else, I am used to danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>O-oppressed...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I can help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You remind me of someone, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I have a friend who is waiting for the return of their younger sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>They always smile fondly when they speak of her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yet I am convinced that they are not truly happy in her absence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Please. Allow me to lend you my strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Wh-why is there ice in here—and it's...floating?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Where is the star whose shadow falls upon the ice? Where is the soul which drifts beneath the floe? With an eye above and an eye below, I will divine their radiant glow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Albea, do you have anything of your brother's? Something that resonates with him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Something...that resonates with my brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Ah! I do! H-here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Is this...a military uniform from the army of Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>My mother gave it to me a long time ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>She made it for me when I was little, for me to grow into. It's based on my brother's uniform.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It's the only real memory I have of my brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>May I borrow it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>P-please take good care of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>But of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What are you going to do with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Project the star steeped in memories upon the ice to reveal the trail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Also...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Y-yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>We will be needing a spell to make sure that everything goes well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>J-just make sure you give it back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Ohohoh! Do you have so little faith in me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>If I didn't have faith in you, I wouldn't have handed it to you in the first place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Oh, dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Your brother's star has sunk to the depths of the river of rage, leaving its light scrambled upon the surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>The river of rage? Does that mean...Wratharis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Upriver lies the source of the star stream itself. It lies still, with open maw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>The source of the...star stream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>The ancient capital, tied to the forbidden art.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>The forbidden art? Alchemy? The ancient...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Wait! Does this mean that there are ruins in Wratharis like the ones in Slothstein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Eventually, your brother's star will be drawn spiraling into the center and engulfed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Taken to the place of the sealed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I knew it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Who are these—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>They're annoying, that's what they are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I see! They're a danger, then, I take it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>You've got that right!</td>
</tr>
