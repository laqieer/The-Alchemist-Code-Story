<td>Huzzaaaaah!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Grr... Grrraaaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's working! We halted the Cursed Beast! Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>My corporeal form shall be the key! My ego shall reach the great plains, and overturn the cosmic principles!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Take all of my magil, and dispel the fog of Lust!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh, surprisingly abrupt once we got it going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But I will show you no mercy. You will die knowing the pain of all the people that lived in this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Rrrraaaaaahhh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hm? Still have the strength to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>A...lone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast is speaking?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Sad... So sad... Why am I...alone...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tch! If you can speak, then tell me! What are you?! Why must you ruin our world?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Rrraaaahh! Aaaaahh! Rrrraaaaaaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There's no point. It's just spilling out the sin it has borne until this day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No... That is not the sin of the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>How do you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I know, because that sin is mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It only makes sense. I am the only human living in this region that can bear the sin of Lust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Those cries that you hear are mine. They're the wails of the little girl I left behind long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ambrosia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But I'm no longer alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Sleep, my past. You are no longer needed in this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Grrrroooooaaarrrrgghhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What is this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This must be the core of the Cursed Beasts. The accumulation of every sin, the source of that outer shell we saw as its physical form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Such a small thing...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Small, but still dangerous. Do not touch it. Though defeated, it is a Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If we humans were to touch it, we would be easily corrupted by sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>All we can do is seal it away somewhere where it cannot be found or reached.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We cannot completely destroy the Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If there was a way to do so, I would be glad to know of it. Vexing, but this is the best we can do for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's fine for now, but someday we'll have to... What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's the same thing we saw in the Gula Belt Region!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The corruption that was within the Cursed Beast is being unleashed now that it has been defeated!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Tch! We've come too far for this region fall to sin now! Waginau, lend me a hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Right! We'll have to purify as much of this corruption with our Spiritbonding as we can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Nngh... Hrrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It's not as bad as the Guardian Dragon, but it's too much for just the two of us...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I-I'm... I'm really sorry, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I am the Vessel of Purification, charged with calming and suppressing the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>With Asmodeus weakened so, my powers of purification should be able to quell this corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The kingdom shall inherit the crown, and the heavenly gates shall open for the souls of the pure. Save us, heal us, spare us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Sephiron, our great Mother, the Tree of Life, crowned supreme; we who pass into temptation, beyond the tertium sephirah, beyond the crossroads.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Save us, the lost souls!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>No, Emmel! Don't touch that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Please...let this work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hmph. So you repel Lust, mortal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>So it wasn't just a dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>But...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Why did the people of that region have to suffer such misery?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>To lose their humanity for falling in love, with those left behind suffering such loneliness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What was the point of such relentless suffering?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>There was no point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>That can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>To search for meaning in this universe is a futile deed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>All that exists in this universe is the Truth I lay upon it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Then our lives... Our existence...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>That said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>What...is this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Defeating the Cursed Beast gave your lives meaning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Such unintended meaning...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Take heed, mortal. The road you have chosen is an untrodden wasteland.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>To disavow sin, to punish it... What awaits you in the end is only loss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Loss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>You have disavowed Lust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Then you chose for the warmth of others to be dispensable. The pleasure of touch, gratuitous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Understand this well. This is what it means to relinquish your sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>W-wait! I still have questions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Huh...? Where am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Emmel! You're awake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Mira...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Nimul! Your sister's awake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Is she?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Ow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hehe, what are you so panicked about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Of course I'm panicked! I don't care if you're the Vessel of Purification! Don't you dare try to take on all that corruption alone, ever again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>One wrong move and you could have... You could have....!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>(Oh, I...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Please don't worry me like that again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Nimul. I didn't mean to worry you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Well? How do you feel? Any fever?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>(I'm sure Nimul touched me... But I felt nothing?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Then you chose for the warmth of others to be dispensable. The pleasure of touch, gratuitous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Understand this well. This is what it means to relinquish your sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>(Could this be what she meant?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>No fever... Good... Hm? Is something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Oh, I'm fine! Really!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>(If this is all, then I'm still okay. I don't want to worry him anymore. I have to hide this.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>(I'm okay. I wasn't meant to be here in the first place.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>All right! Is everybody ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Leaving so soon, are you? How heartbreaking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Forgive us. You've all done so much for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Oh, stop it. We were able to accomplish our goals thanks to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Mira, Nyx. Take care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>You too, Ambrosia. Make sure you're actually in bed when going to sleep, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Also, please be sure to eat well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Do you two think of me as a child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Are you sure about this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Sure or not, Libra's attached to that metal box already. It'd be such a hassle to remove it now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>With Asmodeus gone, winter is ending in this region. Though I can't speak for the other regions...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Surviving shouldn't be a problem here anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Thanks to that, a huge weight has been lifted from my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>What do you plan to do now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I expect I'll just start researching some other subject. There is still so much to be discovered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>That should keep me occupied for a few centuries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Your concept of time is...daunting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Well, you don't have to worry about me. I'll keep myself occupied some way or another, but if you want...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>You are welcome to visit anytime! I consider all of you my apprentices now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I can't seem to recall learning anything from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Well, magic isn't for everybody. I almost pity you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>What?! Hmph! It's not like I'm jealous or anything! My machines are way cooler!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Hahahaha! Well, good on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>So your next destination is...Acedia Belt Region?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Yes. According to Adaleigh, the airship is in serious need of repairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>It's really held up through a lot. Once we get there, we'll need to give the airship a total overhaul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Let me give you a bit of advice, boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Sloth does not only mean laziness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Supplies and luggage are loaded. Is there anything else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I'll be right there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Well, goodbye, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Thank you very much for your assistance, Miss Ambrosia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Anytime. Be good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Although...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Are you sure about this, Winnick? That was your first love, was it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>We have come to realize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Realize what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>The world is so very large. We did not know this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>So, we are not yet worthy. Must learn more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>If that's what you believe, then that's what you should do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>And you, Ambrosia? Still fear love?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Don't get the wrong idea! I'm not scared of falling in love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I just... You know! I just haven't met the right person yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Ambrosia... I think your fear of commitm—ow, ow, ow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Seriously...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>So judgmental...</td>
</tr>
