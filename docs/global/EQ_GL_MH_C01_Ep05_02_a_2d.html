<td>Now that we've all settled down, we should look at conducting some reconnaissance in the forests nearby.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The behavior of the local wildlife, right?</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Spot on, my dear. If the situation is anything like what we've encountered in Lustburg...</td>

<td>Several hours later, they reconvene in a clearing with their findings.</td>

<td>You know... It’s weird of me to say this, because the last couple of assignments all had to do with dispatching vicious beasts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But this is the least aggressive wildlife I've seen so far!</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hmm. The concentration of Alchemia particles here is within normal limits.</td>

<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Perhaps this area isn't the same as where my colleague's sample was retrieved.</td>

<td>What's with these guys?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>They just tore that poor innocent animal apart! I won't forgive this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Count me in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(Guess they really do love animals.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>These might just be the ones we're looking for.</td>
