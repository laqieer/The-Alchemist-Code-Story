<td>Oh, Hayate! Where were you hiding? Hey...are you okay?! You're covered in wounds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>These wounds were inflicted by you, Lady Tamamo. Also, I was lying over there afterwards the whole time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, I see. Hahah♪ When I get too mad, sometimes I become unaware of my surroundings...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So you got hurt again. I-I'm sorry... You're pretty scary as well, Hayate.</td>

<td>I'm sorry for bothering your training! Well then, let's return to Kuzunoha village, Kon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Seriously! You should be embarrassed about allowing those scum to almost trick you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yeah...you're right...I'm sorry for troubling you as well, Hayate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>All right then, as friends, I can come play with you again, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's not play. It's training! Besides, you're still too close in proximity...stand back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Kon, this is the first time I've become friends with someone from the Gyobu tribe!</td>

<td>Hahah, Kon, what are you crying about?! Come on! My instinct was right, wasn't it? There was a strange smell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Nothing is gonna happen, if I stay alone in the hole of the dead tree. That's why I need to muster my courage and go outside♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Sigh... Well, I guess I'm fine with this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hey! If you move around so much you'll trip and fall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Owww!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Heheheh. This is much more fun than being alone♪</td>
