<td>Fighting is necessary. Money isn't. Betrayal is more of a normal occurance than eating. It's just easier to be alone now.</td>

<td>The legendary Othima of Lost Blue, ascended the Mystic Tower Veda and returned to tell about it. Isn't that the story?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>It's different now. Veda has more floors now so it's taller than before.</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So, Othima wouldn't even be a record holder?</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's just a legend, kid.</td>

<td>Whatever. It doesn't matter if it is.</td>

<td>If you think you have what it takes, you should come with me to climb the Tower Veda.</td>
