<td>Koohhh...</td>

<td>Thanks, Black Knight, but even I know where my place is.</td>

<td>Don't say that! You're a one of a kind, Lizardman.</td>

<td>Don't you remember? You used to help us with our PR work.</td>

<td>The so-called bug wasn't you, personally, but the very circumstances.</td>

<td>Oh, you...!</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You gave your all to change your fate. I respect that bravery.</td>

<td>Both the Management and the Truth itself waver, as if they are but hazy illusions...until we are unable to grasp what is right or just. Now that is most amusing!</td>
