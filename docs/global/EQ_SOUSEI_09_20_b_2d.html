<td>Urgh! Gah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>A human...has surpassed me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I already know all of your tricks. There is nothing you can show me in combat that I am not intimately familiar with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And yet...you still struck me down! How could a mere impersonation of me successfully stand its ground?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I know all of it... None of it is new... And yet... And yet...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Because each of us pitches in to do what we can. If one of us reaches out for help, another takes that hand and pulls us up. This is the way of humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And this is why the potential of humans continues to grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>And this is how I differ from you, Ouroboros. I do not shoulder all of it on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Are you saying my failure here...is because I am but one being, alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This is the end, Ouroboros. I have shown you our power. I have proven our resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This world is meant to change. Under the current state of the Belt Regions, humanity's way of life has become much too distorted and untenable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And that's precisely why I need your help, too. Help me save the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Haha...hahahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Why are you laughing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're terribly mistaken, child of man. Your true trial starts here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Now that the floodgates are open, and I am no longer to serve as breakwater, you will continue to live within the sin and corruption you have spurred! Let it overtake you and wash you away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Nimul! Get back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ghah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>My body has already fallen. The collapse of the world is imminent. It has already begun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Collapse?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Now is the time to show me this potential in humanity you boast of...if it truly exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This is a disaster humans have brought into being—Cursed Beasts without form, created by your own hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This shall be the final chance to create the world anew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>All the more reason for us to work together, Ouroboros!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The Ceremony of Creation... The final sacrifice...is me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You've noticed, I'm sure. This huge mass we refer to as the world... And the magil needed to remake it all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's everything. There is nothing beyond the Shell of the World—my flesh and blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But you may rejoice, human. The curtain now closes upon this convoluted creation myth, involving dragons and sin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>As I, the last of the dragons, crumble away, the age of humans can truly begin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Waginau. I'm going to need you to endure for just a bit longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The Ceremony of Creation is about to begin.</td>
