<td>Urgh! Gah...</td>

<td>A human...has surpassed me?</td>

<td>Ouroboros Legacy</td>
<td>I already know all of your tricks. There is nothing you can show me in combat that I am not intimately familiar with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros Legacy</td>
<td>And yet...you still struck me down! How could a mere impersonation of me successfully stand its ground?!</td>

<td>Now that the floodgates are open, and I am no longer to serve as breakwater, you will continue to live within the sin and corruption you have spurred! Let it overtake you and wash you away!</td>

<td>You've noticed, I'm sure. This huge mass we refer to as the world... And the magil needed to remake it all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros Legacy</td>
<td>It's everything. There is nothing beyond the Shell of the World—my flesh and blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros Legacy</td>
<td>But you may rejoice, human. The curtain now closes upon this convoluted creation myth, involving dragons and sin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros Legacy</td>
<td>As I, the last of the dragons, crumble away, the age of humans can truly begin.</td>
