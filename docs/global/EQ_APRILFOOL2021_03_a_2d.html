<td>Anyway, Vlad and I are fine. Neville, you're the one who's in trouble here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Why not take this opportunity to try creating a more distinct identity for yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's a little late for that, don't you think?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There you go again! If you keep quitting before you even start, you'll never get anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah! Give up now, and your chances of ever getting released go right out the window.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You've got kind of an Ice thing going, so why not play that up? They might give you Alchemic Freeze. That would be cool, wouldn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You've got that snake side of you as well, so you could always play that up and hope for a Poison build or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>And how am I supposed to "play up" my snake side, exactly?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Maybe like, when you get healed, you say, "Thanksss, I wasss almossst hissssstory!" or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hard pass on that. That's way too cringe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And when you get KOed, you can be like, "Agh, I'm losing body heat! I'm going to...turn to ice..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>"Now that my Wrath has been extinguished, all that's left for me is to freeze. Aaahhh, freezing ice... Ephemeral ice... Beautiful ice..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Even that first one was way too long. You didn't need a whole second dialogue box! A whole round of combat could be finished off while my voice is still droning out over the field!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, with an attitude like that, you'll never realize your full Evasive Ice Snake potential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Exactly! You need to stop giving up right out of the gate! Don't let your dreams be dreams!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I have no intention of giving up. I haven't said what I'm going to do at all yet, in fact!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Fine. Then why don't you humor us, and try this new persona on for size? See how you like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yeah! Try introducing yourself as the new you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Go on!</td>

<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You can do it!</td>

<td>Ssso, you think my appearanccce looksss... 'cool'? That'sss right; I'm made of iccce, you ssssee. I am the frozen blade that cutsss through anything to ssserve Wratharisss.</td>

<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's not half bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You're out of your mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Nah, you did good. Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>See, you're laughing at me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No, we're not! I swear! Forgive me! Keep your venomous fangs away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh, just shut up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hissssss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>All right, that's it! I've had it with you guys! Let's throw down, right here, right nowâ€”winner is declared the most worthwhile character!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Fine by me. Just be ready to get sent home cryin'!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Funny, I was going to say the same thing to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I hate to pick on someone weaker than me, but if you're going to talk big like that, you leave me little choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>There is...no need...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Shut it! There is too a need for this! Don't try to talk your way out of it now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What are you babbling about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Everyone's...waiting...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You two hardly count as "everyone." But I won't keep you waiting any longer! Let's settle this once and for all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Huh? We didn't say anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I don't even care! Let's just do this! Hisssssss!</td>
