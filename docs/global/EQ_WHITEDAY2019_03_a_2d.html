<td>Numa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Phew... Looks like it's finally over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Jeez... What was the deal with those Rattys, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Maybe the monsters celebrate White Day, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh? No way! That's crazy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I-I wasn't being serious! It was just a joke... Would it kill you to smile once in a while?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Tch. Shut up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What's your problem?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Calm down, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Now... Going back to what you said earlier, did you mean what you said about bringing Fraise to his senses?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Of course I did. I can't stand watching him act the fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm gonna show him that love is nothing but a shackle that limits true strength. Then he'll go back to the way he used to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What do you mean by "bringing him to his senses?" Love is the cornerstone of happiness! It's importance cannot be understated!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>How can you stand there and belittle it, without even trying to listen to your brother's side of things?! You're horrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You kinda are, Gino. Moa's right. You're out of line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Who's side are you on, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>On the side of the ladies, of course. Anything important to them is important to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Pathetic. You're weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Well, it's not like I don't understand how you feel. Standing in the shadow of your big brother must be hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So? What are you actually going to do about it? Are you going to try and get in the way of Fraise and Eve's White Day celebrations?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ohhh no! There's no way I'm gonna let you do that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Besides, how can you even be sure that Fraise has grown weaker because of his feelings for Eve?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You've been going on and on about love being a weakness this whole time, but you don't have a shred of evidence to back up that claim, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well... Not really, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>She's got a point. Why don't you reserve your judgment for now, just sit back, and watch things unfold?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What do you mean? Sit back and watch...what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well... The fastest way to find out would probably be to just follow them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Look! They're right over there! Oohh, you can practically taste love on the air! It's as sweet as honey! I wonder what those two lovebirds are up to on their date?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Tch. Why are we lurking in the bushes like petty thieves? This is pathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Don't be like that. You wanted to know, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No? I only tagged along because I wanted to see how weak he's gotten, so that I can stick it to him later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Um... No, thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>C'mon, now. Today's White Day, isn't it? These cacao cookies are super tasty. Just try one, will yah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I told you, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Are you rejecting my love?! Just take the damn cookies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What the..? Who the hell do you think you are?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>As a knight, I cannot allow you to harass this woman! You will address any further complaints you might have to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If you want someone to eat these cookies so badly, then I will take them off your hands! Well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What?! No way! My love wasn't meant for you! Tch. You'll regret this, you fop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wow! Fraise is so gallant! Surely you can't call him weak after witnessing that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Sure I can! He just let that scumbag go free! He should have beaten him to a pulp and left him unconscious on the side of the road!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Tch... Watching him mess up like that really ticks me off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Aaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, no! My apples! Would somebody please help me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Of course, my lady. Is this all of them? This slope is rather steep, so take care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Th-thank you so much, sir! All of my apples are accounted for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Did you see that?! Not only is Fraise kind, but he's got lightning-fast reflexes to boot! There's nothing weak about him at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Pfft. None of that has anything to do with strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>White Day... Tch. What a bunch of baloney! I didn't even get anything on Valentinesâ€”why should I have to give out presents? Urgh... I wanna smash something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Oho! Looks like we might finally get to see Fraise kick some butt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Now, now! No violence, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Aghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Th-that was...brutal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Looks like your cousin is ever stronger than my brother, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Eve is wonderful, isn't she?! She's so strong, and bold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That's what makes the two of them such a perfect match! They're the ideal couple... Perfectly picturesque!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You really worship her, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yep! I love her to pieces!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>By the way... I guess it's a little late to ask, but don't you have any plans for today, Moa? White Day only comes around once a year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I mean, you're dressed up all nice and everything. Aren't you going to do anything special?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Well... Today, I'm going to be watching over all the couples I see, making sure their love blossoms...and getting rid of anyone who tries to interfere in their affairs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hee hee... That's why I'm wearing this outfit! It's perfect for tailing... I mean, for watching over people from the shadows! No cupid worth their wings would be caught dead in anything else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I...see. So you don't have any admirers? Anyone you're interested in? You're about that age, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Um... Nope! Not really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Love is something that I live to see blossom in other people, and I will tend to their garden of hearts with everything I have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You're a strange one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>So what?! My decisions don't concern you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Shh! Quiet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Lady Eve... Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I thought I heard a voice... It was very familiar, but I suppose I must have just been hearing things. Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Unngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Hey, there. What's the matter, sweetie? Why are you crying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Unnghh... Th-the b-boy I like...s-said that...White Day is stupid...a-and...that he d-doesn't want anything to do...with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>B-but on Valentines Day, I was really brave... I g-gave him chocolates and confessed, and e-everything... But he never said a-anything to me... Unnghh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What?! How rude! I'm going to go and give him a stern talking-to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>She's the one in the wrong! You can't just thrust a gift on someone and expect something in return. And crying is the coward's way out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>What is wrong with you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Both of you, keep it down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I see... So that's why you're crying, hm? Well... I'm sure that this boy you like is just shy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It was good of you to be so brave. And you know what? I'm sure that by doing so you, inspired some bravery in your crush, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>What are you crying about? Jeez... I can't give you these cookies unless you're alone, y'know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Well, what do you know? Looks like he had something for you all along!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Look, I can understand feeling shy, but she overcame her embarrassment just for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>So don't leave her hanging. You're better than that, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Y-yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Oh, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I'm sorry about earlier. Here... This is for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Th-thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>That was rather sweet, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>It really was! I'm so glad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Way to go, Fraise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Hmph. He's always been good at dealing with children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>He's kind, and dependable... I'm pretty sure that every kid in the neighborhood saw him as a big brother figure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>That sounds about right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>But I'm not a child anymore, and I'm going to surpass him. I'm already stronger than that fool...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Dammit all! At this rate, I'm never gonna get to prove how weak he's gotten!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>If something big doesn't happen soon, White Day will be over beforeâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Watch out! There's a Ratty on the rampage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Look what you did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Me?! I didn't do anything! It's just a coincidence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Wh-what on earth is that?! It's heading this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Oh, no! Eve, look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Nuuuuumaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Nu, numa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Eve! Are you hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I-I'm fine! Th-thank you, Lord Fraise...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Thank the gods. Let's get going, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Wow! That was so cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Fraise is amazing! He pulled off the perfect romantic scene without a hitch! Ooh, I bet Eve's stomach was full of butterflies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Hey, Gino! Were you watching that?! You can't deny how strong Fraise is now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>You don't have to tell me that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>But you keep calling him weak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I know he's strong, all right?! I know that better than anyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Why don't we all just take a deep breath and calm down a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>There are more important things for us to discuss... Like what the hell is the deal with all of these rampaging Rattys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>This is the second time we've come across them, so I'm not sure we can pass it off as just a random occurrence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Come to think of it... What happened to that guy running the sweetshop?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Eve was standing over there earlier, wasn't she? Right outside the storefront...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Maybe we should check it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Welcome! Are you here to purchase some of my Purple Cacao cookies, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>One bite of this, and your sweetheart will swoon at your feet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Purple Cacao? That doesn't sound good... I'd better ask Eve about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>You're not wrong. Stores using purple cacao have to give notice, and unless they're given permission to use the ingredient, they're meant to steer clear of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Of course, those who have been given permission should have their license on display...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Oh, pipe down, will ya?! Cookies sell much faster when they've got the purple stuff in 'em!</td>
