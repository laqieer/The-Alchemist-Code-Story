<td>That should do it!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The monsters are running away. We did it!</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Not bad, visitors.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Lower your bow, Tina. He is not our enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's been a while, Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It has. I'm sorry for leaving you in charge of this place alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I am lost to this world anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There's no need for you to feel responsible.</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Kamui, who is he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>He is the one tasked with watching over Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Y-you are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Um... Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ah, never mind. I was just remembering an old friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I would like to perform a star reading. May we use the arboreal altar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Of course, my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Logi, this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We will now trace the bond between the Sacred Stones to find the star hidden in shadows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Concentrate, and conjure in your mind the one you seek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I beseech the supreme...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>All is born under the crown. Wisdom and understanding form beauty on the soil.</td>

<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Show me the guidance of the stars!</td>

<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What's wrong? Did you find Agatha?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I see. So this is all your doing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ah, sorry. It's nothing. I did find out where Agatha is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Where? Where is she?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The Door of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>An inaccessible territory to the ordinary. She is trapped within the shadow cast by the eternal light of wisdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I... I don't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You mean she's beyond the door where we made our contracts? Is that where she is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Not beyond the door itself. Somehow, through the power of Alchemy, she is caught in a chasm there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>If that's true, can we even save her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I haven't seen that door since I made the deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Me neither.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Just as I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We haven't much time. There are certain people who we cannot let know that we've found her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>To free her, we will be needing your strength, Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wait, can you at least explain—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I wander the path of wisdom. Though the path may be lost, I still hold the stairway within me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I am the one who breaks the lock!</td>
