<td>Now, I understand that you wanted to present your sweethearts with this egg in order to make up for your most recent spat...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That is commendable of you. However, do you really think it would be happily received, knowing that you had gotten into a fist-fight to possess it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm glad that we are in agreement. Now, enjoy yourselves peacefully, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>All right, now that that has been taken care of... Neica? Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I-is this really okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I got to watch Teona's battle prowess firsthand, from right up close...and I didn't even have to buy a ticket or anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Easter...is my new favorite holiday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Her graceful, limber movements! The way her muscles tighten under her skin! She is nothing less than art in motion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Neica, please! C-calm yourself this instant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Obviously, you must've trained a lot—right, Teona?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>O-oh, w-well... Yes, I suppose I did. I had to train doubly hard so that I could surpass my elder brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Your brother...? Oh! He appeared in the Gladiator Collection, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hmhmhm. I am impressed and humbled by the depth of your knowledge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>My brother was tremendously strong, but strength was not all that he possessed; he also fought in a style that bewitched his opponents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>For when my brother swung his sword, everyone would prostrate themselves at his feet. When victory was his, smiles would break out all around him, on both sides of the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>He had everyone under his spell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I wish only to follow in his footsteps, by bringing joy to those around me and enchanting them with my talents on the battlefield. So I have trained and trained, giving every single session my all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>As such, I hope you know that your words just now meant an awful lot to me, Neica. I thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>T-Teona...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Um... Teona? Don't you ever get scared, when you have to stand in front of people like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmm... I suppose I have felt afraid at one time or another. I would hate to disappoint people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>When I feel that way, however, I remind myself of what I want to protect: the hopes and dreams of the people, and their smiles. Suddenly, I find myself filled to bursting with courage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wow... Teona, you're really amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hmhmhm. I appreciate that, Neica. But I hope you realize that you yourself are rather extraordinary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Earlier you called this egg "regular," but it is nothing of the sort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There is nothing "regular" about an egg so sweet that it can make grown men forget themselves enough to get into a fight over it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I-I guess you have a point, but...I really don't think I can do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>J-just go home already! I might have a thing for warriors from the Colosseum, but I haven't the slightest interest in real fights of any kind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Why're you being so stubborn, eh?! Don't hide your Neica Powers from the world! The whole country is missing out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Having you around gives the troops of our great nation a boost to morale! We're counting on you for that, you hear?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>C-counting on me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>We came out of that skirmish victorious, but I don't really feel like a winner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I thought it'd be an easy victory, 'cause of all the Neica Power going around, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Everybody was making a big deal out of it—Neica Power this, Neica Power that... But it seems like it's just a bunch of cowardly codswallop for that girl to protect herself with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>(Wh-what?! How can they say such terrible things?! They drag me out of my own home, only to treat me like this?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>(Haven't I done enough?! What more can they ask of me?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I did my best, even though I was scared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>There's no way I could have lived up to their expectations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmm... It seems that standing on center stage is too much for you, Neica.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ungh... Y-yes. It's just not me! I've never felt like it did any good, anyway...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You've been placed in a bit of a difficult situation, haven't you? Well, I believe that the final decision is yours and yours alone. It's up to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I will say, however, that there are many people who would be thrilled to see you show your face at the festival today. I hope that you will keep that in mind when you make your decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I wonder what kind of look the person playing Neica will go for this year?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Right?! The costumes are always so on point! I can't wait to watch her enchant the Imperial Easter Egg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hey... Doesn't the egg look kinda different this year, though? It's not as, like...sparkly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I guess so? Ooh! Maybe it's part of the show!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well... We had better get back to searching for that egg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Whatever you decide can wait until after the egg has been safely restored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>R-right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(If I run away from this just because I'm afraid of getting up there in front of everyone... They'll all be so disappointed. They'll be sad.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(B-but I... I still don't think I can do it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Where could that egg be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hey! Teona! Neica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What's the matter?! I...don't suppose you found the egg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Not yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>A couple of people have started noticing something off about the impostor egg up there, so things aren't looking very good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>So you're not having much luck either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We've also caught wind of some suspicious people wearing masks who are going around looking for the person who's playing Neica this year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You! You're the one who's going to enchant that egg this year, aren't yah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>People just like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Thank you, Lotiyah. I had surmised as much. So... What can we do for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>We can do this the easy way, or the hard way, but regardless, she's coming with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>So I don't get a choice?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You're going to use your powers to enchant the Imperial Easter Egg for us! Once it is complete, our noble ambitions will be realized at long last!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Wh-what on earth are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Don't worry, we'll deal with this lot!</td>
</tr>
