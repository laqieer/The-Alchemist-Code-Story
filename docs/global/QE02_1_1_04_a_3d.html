<td>Good night, Fiona. See you tomorrow...huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...Are you a thief?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I've just paid off our factory workers' late night salaries. You won't find much here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Very funny. And the hidden fortune you've built off the Sacred Stone Belphegor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Belphegor? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Behind your mask as a competent mayor, it seems you've been dabbling in the military industry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Honestly. I doubt the Sacred Stone enjoys being used as a tool of murder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hm. So, you want to rob the Sacred Stone. That's an act of suicide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Belphegor is the anchor to quell this turbulent land. If you take it away, it will lead to the destruction of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The anchor to quells this turbulent land?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You don't seem to know the power contained in the Sacred Stone. The power is so great, I cannot use it as a substitute for my own desires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If you still insist on pursuing it, then unravel the meaning of my words and find where the Stone is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I don't mind entrusting it to you, if you have the courage to confront the threat ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Sorry, but I didn't come here to partake in pleasant bargaining.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Give me the Sacred Stone if you want to see your daughter's face again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're going to kill me anyway, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If you kill me, the mysteries surrounding the Sacred Stone will be buried in darkness. Think carefully before pulling the trigger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No! Don't shoot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Fiona?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If you're going to shoot someone, shoot me! Papa needs to protect this country! He can't die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Fiona!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm so proud of you; you've grown into a fine young girl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I've no intention of telling you where the Sacred Stone is. You'll have to take my life and give that to your client as a substitute instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But...you must not lay your hands on my daughter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This girl will one day be the light that illuminates this country's future. Her existence will cause the hearts of others to blossom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Take my life. Come now, do it quick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmph. You two share a beautiful relationship. Honestly, you make me cry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Shut up! Hurry up and...huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Stop making me cry, you idiot...sniff... The love you have for her...it's too much, man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wh-what's wrong with you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Can you swear on your daughter's name that you're using the Sacred Stone to save this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Of course I can. As mayor, my job is to create a future that our children can live in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Fine. I'll solve the mystery of the Sacred Stone. You better not kick the bucket before then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Heh. Whether you want to take over this country or steal my daughter, do as you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That is, if you can unravel the mystery of the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hah. Don't forget those words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Pa-papa! He's leaving! Is that okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yeah. That man wants to save this worldâ€”just like your papa.</td>
