<td>Oh, that's strange. Your soul also exists in a distant world.</td>

<td>I am...huh? My memory... What's going on? Hey, who are you?</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>I am Ouroborosâ€”the observer of destiny who bonds this world with truth.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hm...I see. I sense an energy within you that's different from Alchemy. Are you a warrior from another world?</td>

<td>Yeah, I'm Vargas! Ah, that's it! I'm Vargas!</td>

<td>Yes.</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well, just watch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Very well. I will observe the energy of your soul!</td>
