<td>The wolf is coming. The wolf is coming. The wolf is coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No...! The house is on fire! This is a joke, isn't it? This has to be a dream!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Everyone, wake up! Take the women and children to the village mayor's house!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Mr. Soldier, please help! My mom has a fever and she can't move...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Burn everything! Leave no traces behind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We are a wolf pack. Our shapeless terror will demonstrate our value!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The wolf came, he saw, he killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh... When will I be free of this dream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Freed! It's been a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well well, General Neville the Ice Snake. What would you like with your humble librarian?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Come now. That's no way to speak to an old classmate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My apologies for the irony. So what did you want with me? I'm surprised you stopped by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, I'd love to reminisce about old times, however...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Has something troublesome occurred? It's always these things when it comes to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Don't say that. Neither Caesar nor Vlad cared to inquire about these occurrences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Furthermore, my subordinates lack any influence when it comes to the nobility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So you want me to wield my father's authority? I'm worried this will eventually be the death of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Resources from the border village of Envylia that were meant for the Stones has been halted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>For how long?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>These past few months.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Of course, it's just one of many facilities. The halt of supplies in and of itself won't cause too many problems. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Something sounds fishy. Are there any signs of one of the houses having made a move?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>There are no noticeable movements from within the Capital. At least nothing has occurred on the surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's troublesome. Wasn't that an orphanage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>They were receiving sufficient aid, and our demands were within a humanitarian range. If there is a problem, it must be some form of fraud...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Or perhaps the Holy Guard have caught wind of our research. Either way, we must hurry to confirm this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No need to rush things. Shouldn't we take a more measured approach?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Many of my subordinates were originally orphans. I want to avoid any problems spreading from there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Do you think it will result in war?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>At this rate, it may be inevitable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Very well. It might be worth being useful to our country from time to time. I'll prepare for an inspection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Much appreciated. Oh, also...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'll pass this on to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's a prototype for a Stone. After one use it will crumble, but it should help make your Alchemy stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Are you sure you want to hand such a precious thing to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I've determined that you'll need it. Let it be a reminder of how important this mission is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Of course. If you can avoid using it, there's no harm in that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Why does war always make people rush through life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Both time and history will eventually pass, we silently allow ourselves to drown in oceans of books.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh, this world truly is a stifling place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ah, welcome! You must be tired from your long journey. I've prepared a room!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>No, I am stationed outside the village. Thank you for your concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Is that so? I thought you were here for the Stone's ingredients...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Director.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>A-ah, apologies! However, if not for that then why on earth...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Like I said, I am here just to inspect. There is no need for you to cater to my requests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh, that being said, how are the children?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>All of them are fine, although a majority of them have suffered from the loss of their parents or siblings in the war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>However, thanks to His Majesty's generous support, they have been able to spend their days with smiles on their faces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Any effect from the blood collecting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>As per our instructions, we have been securing a small bottle's worth every month only from the children with high levels of Alchemia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Oh...last month, one of the elder children came down with a cold, so the amount we sent was less than usual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I see. Last month, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(According to Neville though, there's been a halt over the past few months. Well, well...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'll request for His Majesty's continued support, so please rest assured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Indeed! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Well then, I'll return to my station.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Ah. I'll take you to the gate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...Ah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Oops. Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yes, Mr. Soldier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Hey, Blanchett, you're not with the others?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The other children said they saw a rabbit in the forest, and they went running off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>They left the hospital without permission...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I'll stay in my room.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Very well. I'm sorry to have left the children in your care. Please rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Who was that child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Her? She recently came to this orphanage. A few months ago her village was burned down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Burned down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Apparently, they were attacked by bandits. The landlord looked into the matter, but could not make clear of what had occurred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>This applies to all the children of this orphanage...but it is tragic that they've all lost something at such a young age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>A halt of supplies over the past few months.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>A decline in supplies for last month.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>A few months ago, someone burned down a village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The landlord, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Well hello, handsome. Is this seat taken?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Neville told me about you. Apparently, you're a resourceful informant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Can you at least try to play along a little more?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I've taken care of this place myself, so there's no need for unnecessary measures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You don't really seem to understand how adults socialize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>So what did you want to ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I'm still in the preliminary stage of my investigation. I'd like to know everything I can about this village, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>To begin with, what kind of person is the landlord?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Oh, well you're a clever one. The administrator of the National Library appointed without having accomplished much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I thought you'd just be leeching onto your father's name, but it seems like you might actually make for stimulating conversation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>So do you have any information?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I have quite the story, actually. It's just a rumor but a highly credible one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>...So?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>The landlord here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Oh, good! There you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Director?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>The villagers said they saw a wolf in the woods. Apparently, someone has been attacked as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>The children have gone into the forest and haven't returned yet! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>First, calm down. Do you know where the children are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Most likely, they went to pick wild vegetables...there's a spot that the village hunter often teaches them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>First, let's go there and look. I'm sorry Vanekis, but we'll have to continue this conversation later...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Yes. When you return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Well then, Director. Can you please lead the way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Y-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Oh, found a mushroom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Hey! That's a poison mushroom, you know? The color is weird.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>True. But maybe it's okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>No, it's not! Look, let's eat the wild vegetables we were taught about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Really? But they're so bitter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>...Hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Oh! Blanc! Were you here too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>The sun is setting. The director is worried so how about we go home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Hey, Blanchett! You're new here! Don't act so bossy just because you're older than us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>No, I'm not trying to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Just a little bit longer! Remember what the teacher said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>This year, the taxes are really high, so we've hardly been able to store any wheat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>But we can come again tomorrow...huh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Blanc? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>...It's coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Huh? What's coming...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Ahhhh?! A wolf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Eeek?! N-no, don't come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Ah...aaaah! Ha...aahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Honestly! How annoying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Blanchett...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Oh, but I might as well extend my hospitality! Right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I'll chop you into small pieces!!! Come on! Who's inside your stomach?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Wh-what are you doing?! Hurry, we need to run...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>What's that?! You're in the way so back off! I'm completely annoyed by the stink of these beasts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Groooowwl!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Ahahaha! There's more! And more! I'll tear you all to pieces!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Blanchett!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>(The Philosopher's Stone is responding to her Alchemia?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>No, now isn't the time to think. Please stand back, Director. We'll take care of this.</td>
</tr>
