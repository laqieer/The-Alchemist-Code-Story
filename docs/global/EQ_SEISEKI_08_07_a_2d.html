<td>Agh!!! Ackkk!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Othima!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ug...Gfff! I-it appears that my magic is not very effective against you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>N-no matter what technique I use...you reduce its power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes. I am being used for my ability to resist your magic attacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ughh...! So...you were sent with the sole purpose of handling me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>B-but no matter how much I search for your weakness...you change your attack pattern every time you change that artificial arm of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Jeez. To be honest, I'm in a bit of a pickle here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Captain Othima, it is an honor to hear you think so highly of my abilities. Please, rest peacefully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>?! Aghh!!! Akk...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>!!! ...Hm?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well then...you now no longer have anyone to protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Please obediently hand over the Sacred Stone Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You are foolish to think I would hand it over to the likes of you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...Hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A-an iron fist...?! Wh-what are you planning on doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If you will not hand the Sacred Stone to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I will rip every single limb off of you until you tell me its whereabouts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I would be most appreciative if you would tell me before I have to remove all of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>S-such threats will not...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's not a threat. It's the truth. Once I'm done with all your limbs, I'll rip your upper body off of your lower body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Worst case scenario, as long as I leave your brain intact, I should be able to probe its depths for the answers I seek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>First of all, an arm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ugh...?! L-let me go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Of course...as soon as you tell me where the Sacred Stone is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>As I just told you, my sole purpose for being here is to find the Sacred Stone. It's not to take your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Uck...! Furious Blizzard!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Aghh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>A-alright!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...! Hm! Let go...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No...I still haven't learned where the Sacred Stone is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Is it not working on her?! Ack! Absolute Darkness!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Uck...! You're very persistent...wouldn't have expected any less from you, Captain Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I-I'm starting to lose confidence...seeing how little effect it has.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Y-you know...as a gentleman, I'd like to ask for a favor. Do you think you can let go of Her Majesty's arm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ack! Y-you little brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>My intention is not to make you sad, Captain Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I will save hurting her for until I've properly dealt with you first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Th-then...I guess that means I can't afford to let that happen...Mystic Fire!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It won't work. It's time to say goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ughh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>After all the stories I've heard about you, it was an honor to have been able to fight you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ugfff...! My...stical...Fire...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You don't give up until your last breath. Your fighting spirit is...admirable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>U-ugh... My last breath? Don't be silly. My flames have only started to burn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Is this...the Phoenix?! ...Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ugh...! D-did you see that? My final evolution of Mystical Fire. I call it "Phoenix's Dance"...or something like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Seriously...you had me worried about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>But...if you have enough time to be spewing nonsense then I guess you're okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>G-great timing! I'm so relieved to see you, Kagura. I was in a real fix here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Kagura...of the 5th Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Captain Othima, why don't you rest for a while? I'll take it from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>He-hey, wait...! The problem is that magic attacks don't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...! What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>She dropped to her knees! Is it working?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Th-this flame...! Does it mean that I've been inflicted with damage?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What I wield is Kagutsuchi. It's a little different than ordinary magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I see! Kagura's magic was born from Wadatsumi. They use a unique form of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I-it's surpassing the scope of her magic defense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It seems like I'm not a very compatible partner for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Ack...! Gauntlet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>This isn't your time to shine. Get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...Burning Heavens!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You've defused my attack...? Sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...! Burn Out!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Agh!!! It's true. It appears your attack techniques are quite effective against me. But...I cannot afford to lose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Even Kagutsuchi's power is reduced in half. I'm sorry, Your Majesty...would you mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Whoa! C-careful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>It seems like it'll be more effective if I overpower you...Axe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Such sad eyes. You've suffered from a painful past, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>But I won't sympathize with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Not only did I lose my family, but my entire country was destroyed. I also have had a painful past!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Ack...! I don't have time to be talking with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Flaming Kagutsuchi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Ug...ughh! I-it has no effect! I won't lose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I-I...I'm going to see the ideal word imagined by Sol come to fruition!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Venomous Lure!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...! You used something as silly as a pillar to seal my movement? Please don't get in my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>No...it's wonderful. Your power is astounding, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>The force behind your incredible magic defense comes from that eye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>In that case...if I were to seal your power, what would happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>M-my eye! The eye that Sol gave to me...my power to protect myself...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Sol... You're carrying out this individual's instructions, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>The way you push yourself so hard to fulfill his orders, without fearing for your own safety...I can almost respect that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>But...what you're doing is threatening the peace of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>N-no...! I...I just want to be by Sol's side when he creates his ideal world!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>It's unfortunate. When it comes down to it, the only thing that separates us is a difference in values for what we perceive justice to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>For your sake as well...I promise to end this cycle of tragedy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Ug...ughh...! Ughhh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Y-you can do it...! Kagura!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Got it! Kagutsuchi...Flying Star!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Ack...! Ackkk!!! Ee...eekkkkk!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Huh...?! What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Did you...kill her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>No... It's almost as if...I erased all her powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I need to go back...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>No way...?! Did she just escape my Flying Star?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>I was told that if I lost my power, I must return. Excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Ack...! H-hey, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Did she...disappear?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Does that mean you got rid of her?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Your Highness! Reinforcements have arrived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Greed Dike's invasion has also stagnated. It's the perfect time for a counterattack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>All right! I can see victory in sight! Othima, let's go all out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Victory...? Are you kidding me? I'm filled with a sense of defeat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I can't believe even my Flying Star didn't finish her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>There's no point in feeling down. Let's get back to the others, Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>...Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>The Veda Templars, huh? Jeez. Who would've thought someone of that caliber existed?</td>
