<td>Haaa... Haaa...agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ugh...! D-dang it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You have desecrated the oath we swore, Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Gerald! Stop it! That's enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Silence, Natalie. Those who follow me require their leader to have an iron will. I must finish this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I have not forgotten what you once said. "I want to be the sun that brings joy to the people in this world." Where is that sun now? How could it have sunk so low?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Heh heh... Y-you never change. Stubborn as e-ever...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I merely live by the oath we swore to uphold. This is the path we chose. For you to renounce it now... You are not the person you once were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I pity you, Vettel. We were once comrades who shared the same ambitions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ugh...! Grraah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You leave me no choice. Now that you have abandoned the Scarlet Flame, I must reject sentimentality for the youth we once shared and use my blade to sever the ties that bind us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Aghh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The setting...Scarlet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...Flame... Iron will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No, Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We swore to uphold this oath with our lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>All we wanted was a blissful world filled with laughter and joy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No way, this is too lame. Do we really have to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What do you mean, lame?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well, I mean...an oath? Really? We're not little kids anymore. It's embarrassing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What does age have to do with it? It's practically a tradition. Knights have been swearing oaths since—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Cool it, would you? It's exactly that kind of earnest enthusiasm that I'm saying is lame! Don't you think so, Vettel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Actually...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Seriously?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hahaha! Don't overthink it! It's just the three of us reaffirming the values we already share.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But we have to take it seriously. This is how we're going to cement our camaraderie and our unyielding will—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We are so not on the same page here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Enough! Are we doing this or not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Fine! Whatever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Let's get this over with before anyone sees us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Natalie, I'm really not liking your attitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Uh-oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Come on, Gerald. Now we're just waiting on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ugh. Natalie, we will discuss this later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oooh, sorry. I already have plans for later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Tch. Fine! Come on, let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We hereby swear to defend the setting Scarlet and hold in our hearts the Flames to manifest our iron will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Our blades we wield only to protect the happiness of the people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And I promise to always support these two rash, reckless idiots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We vow now and forevermore to be the defenders of the Scarlet Flame!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Here, we swear that our iron will shall stand indomitable in the face of hardship in order to ensure the joy and laughter of the people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I will never forget the beautiful scarlet sunset of that day as we declared those naive, honest words in our youthful folly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa... Do not break rank! Stay together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Natalie! Behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huh?! Wha—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>No! Huzzaaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Th-thanks, Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Stay frosty. Something is off here... These bandits are almost too well organized. What do you make of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I was thinking the same thing. I doubt these are our typical bandits. Did you see that therian's corpse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It looked like it was instantly mummified.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>So the target isn't the village, but the villagers themselves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Brother Gerald! The bandits have surrounded us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>How do we get out of this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>We'll charge a single point! I'll pave the way ahead! Everybody just stay behind me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>W-wait a second! There's no need to sacrifice yourself like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>There's no time to argue! The therian village could be under attack right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>We must break through at once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You know, I never thought I'd see such compassion from you, Gerald.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I'm just surprised you're willing to do so much to save therians.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>This has nothing to do with the therians. My priority is the mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>We need a lot more wins to make a name for ourselves as the Scarlet Legion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>"We must complete every mission without fail." I know. That's what we have to do in order to keep our promise with Vettel, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>This has nothing to do with him. Don't ever say that name again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>They're coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I'll deal with them! Everybody, head straight for the village! Go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Urgh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Why did he...? Gerald, did you do something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Brother Gerald! The bandits heading toward our right flank are down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>It's now or never! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Tch! After them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What luck. It seems that I've caught a few more mice than I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Look! Another bandit down! Over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>This is the sixth one! Is it the therians backing us up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Do these look like wounds from a therian to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You're right... These wounds cannot have been inflicted by just anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Could it have been the reinforcements we were promised?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>The reinforcements from the Holy Guard! Our mission is to defend the therian village until they arrive, remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Maybe they were able to get here earlier than anticipated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>If that were the case, we wouldn't have to speculate. They'd come straight to us for a status report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Well... I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>The Holy Guard is supposed to arrive with a platoon. There's no way we'd fail to notice the arrival of that many knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I see. I didn't realize you were so familiar with the organization of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Oh, just admit it. You were worried about Vettel, so you studied up on those Paladins, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Not now, Natalie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>H-hey... Cool it! Your hair is sparking again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>He turned his back on our oath, and ran off to join the Holy Guard, seeking power! I told you to forget about him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>And I'm just saying that's up to interpretation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>From my perspective, it wasn't personal. I think Vettel just figured he could do more for people, like he wanted, by joining the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>That's enough! He's not coming back, so it's a waste of time even thinking abou—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Zap-zap, crackle-crackle, buzz-buzz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah... I apologize for getting upset. We should get to the village as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Yeah. We should just concentrate on the mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Brother Gerald! The therian village is right up ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Let's go! There's no time to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>What a relief... It looks like everything is fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>No, listen. It's too quiet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Excuse me... Are you the "Scarlet Legion"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I am the chief of this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Oh! Our deepest apologies for being late. We were hired by the chief of Rubalk Village to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Oh, no need for formalities. After all... Well. I do appreciate that you have come all this way. You are welcome to rest here before you leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>A member of the Holy Guard has already arrived, and we believe we are in good hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>He single-handedly routed the bandits that were encroaching on our village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>So...the job here is done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>B-but wait! We came all this way—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Natalie, there's nothing we can do. May we at least have a word with this Holy Guard knight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>He is alone, correct? Perhaps we can be of some help until the rest of the platoon arrives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Um... I'm sure that won't be necessary. Actually, it was the knight's suggestion to let you return earlier than we expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I believe his exact words were, "There is no need to have unnecessary hands in the pot. The affairs of the Holy Guard should remain our own."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>And to be honest, if we must ask for help from humans, we feel more secure asking a more reliable entity, like the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Honestly, all of this could have been avoided if the chief of Rubalk Village hadn't gone ahead and contacted you without consulting with us. I apologize for the misunderstanding, but we would appreciate it if you took your leave as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>This isn't right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>...Always the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>What might you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>My father, who died fighting bandits for you therians' sake, was victim to mistreatment by you lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>A brother-in-arms of his that was there with him told me none of you said a single word of gratitude, right to the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Not even a prayer for the man who died protecting your people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Let's go, Natalie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>This wasn't a mission fit for us to begin with. There isn't a single blade wielded by the Scarlet Legion meant to protect this disrespectful lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Dang it! Dang it! Dang! Dang it! Dang it!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Hey. You're sparking worse than me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>How can you be so calm?! Everything we did was for nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Getting so worked up over the actions of therians is a waste of emotion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Ugh!!! That village chief! And that Paladin! What's their deal?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>A Paladin from the Holy Guard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>"Unnecessary hands in the pot"?! What kind of person can be so dismissive of people they haven't even met before?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>I can't believe Vettel could be part of an organization with people like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Brother Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Woah, uh... You seem pissed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>We found another dried up therian corpse. We just figured we ought to report it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Another corpse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Ugh! And we haven't even gotten to the bottom of this mystery! This is so frustrating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Let's check it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>I have a feeling that whatever the bandits are after and...the reason my father had to die...are related.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Well...we do have a bit of free time on our hands now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Then I can no longer be a mere spectator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>This world is on the verge of great reform. Interference at this time is most undesirable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>It would be wise to eradicate a future hindrance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>Are you the one in command of the bandits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Heh heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Heads up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Be grateful! It is an honor to lose your life to the same hands that will shape the world's future! Dark Bringer!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>What?! Everybody get back!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>Oh? A bold choice to stand your ground rather than to run. Bold, indeed...but wrong, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>...?! Aghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Gerald!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Urgh! This can't be! What are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>I...? Heh. I am the one that will lead this world into the future. You should consider yourself lucky to be cut down by my blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Urgh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Gerald, get out of there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Perish before my regal grandeur!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Huzzzaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>My, my...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Ugh! Ngh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>What a pleasant surprise. I didn't expect that your skill would be such that you would be able to halt my blade. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Wh-what is this power?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>This is the true power of a supreme ruler. I have the strength to be the messiah this world needs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Supreme ruler...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Heh heh... Those therians were quite fortunate to have the chance to be a part of the formation of my legacy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>That power... The therians?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>So the therians themselves were the target?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>I tire of this. The dead have no need for answers. Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>How...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>For this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>To drain the blood of therians? My father died...for this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Gerald...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>What of it? Heh, a shortsighted fool could never understand how this po—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Silence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Well, well. Very impressive. I never thought a simple mercenary would have such strength concealed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>We are no ordinary mercenaries! We are the Scarlet Legion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>A legion built on iron will that will someday bring light into this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Oh...? Iron will, you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>Whoa! Wh-what the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Where did that come from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>It seems my other prey has finally made its move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Prey?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>I sensed it every time I approached you. It has yet to show itself, but...it seems to object to our encounter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>Hey, wait! Where do you think you're going?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Where there is light, there is also shadow. It should be interesting to leave a challenge such as you on my path. I shall remember you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>A-again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa... He got away again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>You?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Vettel? Is that you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Oh... Hey. It's been a while. Never thought I'd meet you guys here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>That attack...was you? What is going on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>Nothing that concerns you. You should all leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>You've seen what he can do. This is beyond you all. Withdraw from this case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>You have no right...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>Wait! The Paladin from the Holy Guard... Was that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>Yeah. I don't need anybody that will weigh me down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>I asked the chief to drive you away, but I didn't think you guys would end up in battle here of all places.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>Why, you insolent...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>You're lying! Even that strange man was saying that you've been trying to keep us away from him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>You're just trying to protect us, aren't you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>No... I simply don't have time to deal with weaklings that would just get in my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>You're lying. You have to be lying! This isn't like you, Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>Just say it! You're trying to protect us from that man! Right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>Natalie. Stand back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>You must pay for your transgressions against our oath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>Gerald?! What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>Natalie, it's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>Vettel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240</td>
<td>Sometimes, this is the best way to make ourselves understood. Right, Gerald?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>241</td>
<td>...Exactly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>242</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa...agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>243</td>
<td>Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>244</td>
<td>Ugh...! D-dang it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>245</td>
<td>You have desecrated the oath we swore, Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>246</td>
<td>Gerald! Stop it! That's enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>247</td>
<td>Silence, Natalie. Those who follow me require their leader to have an iron will. I must finish this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>248</td>
<td>Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>249</td>
<td>I have not forgotten what you once said. "I want to be the sun that brings joy to the people in this world." Where is that sun now? How could it have sunk so low?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>250</td>
<td>Heh heh... Y-you never change. Stubborn...as ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>251</td>
<td>I merely live by the oath we swore to uphold. This is the path we chose. For you to renounce it now... You are not the person you once were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>252</td>
<td>I pity you, Vettel. We were once comrades who shared the same ambitions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>253</td>
<td>Gerald!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>254</td>
<td>Ugh...! Grraah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>255</td>
<td>You leave me no choice. Now that you have abandoned the Scarlet Flame, I must reject sentimentality for the youth we once shared and use my blade to sever the ties that bind us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>256</td>
<td>Aghh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>257</td>
<td>Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>258</td>
<td>What's the matter? Is that all you've got?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>259</td>
<td>Gerald, please stop! This isn't the time for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>260</td>
<td>What are you on about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>261</td>
<td>Vettel was defending the village alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>262</td>
<td>If he's here, then the village is vulnerable! What if the bandits attack?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>263</td>
<td>Now that their commander has fled, I doubt the bandits will return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>264</td>
<td>Besides, the Holy Guard should be arriving soon. Leave it to them.</td>
</tr>

<td>The Holy Guard are not coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>267</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>268</td>
<td>We received information that Gluttony Foss is making a move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>269</td>
<td>No... You mean Wratharis in danger of another invasion?! Is this going to be another Thousand Nights?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>270</td>
<td>We're not sure. The Holy Guard has been ordered to stand by on high alert. They can't leave their stations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>271</td>
<td>So they've just forsaken the therians?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>272</td>
<td>If that's the case...then what are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>273</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>274</td>
<td>Speak. There's no point in keeping your secrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>275</td>
<td>I just can't ignore people in need of help, even if the government has other priorities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>276</td>
<td>So you disobeyed orders and left your post?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>277</td>
<td>If it were just some bandits, the villagers could have held their own. However, these are no ordinary bandits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>278</td>
<td>I noticed that as well. Their organization is not typical of mere bandits. What exactly is happening here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>279</td>
<td>Their swordsmanship resembles that of soldiers from Wratharis...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>280</td>
<td>I haven't found anything definitive. That said...there is a rumor among the Paladins that someone is draining the blood of therians for Alchemia Particles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>281</td>
<td>Alchemia Particles?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>282</td>
<td>A substance said to be the source of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>283</td>
<td>That man was using...So that's what the source of his power was!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>284</td>
<td>I guess now we know why the bandits were targeting therians.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>285</td>
<td>We were commissioned to protect the therian village from bandits, but then we received orders to stay put...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>But it's just not in me to stand around and do nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>287</td>
<td>I never could have guessed you guys would be here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>288</td>
<td>So you disobeyed orders and slipped away. How irresponsible. You are aware of the punishment for insubordination, are you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>289</td>
<td>I bet you didn't expect that Gerald has been spending his time studying the Holy Guard because he was worried about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>290</td>
<td>I told you, that's not how it is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>291</td>
<td>It is possible that they are right... It makes sense logically that the big picture should matter more than individual concerns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>292</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>293</td>
<td>Unfortunately, on a personal level, I cannot handle the hypocrisy of claiming to be righteous while leaving vulnerable people to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>294</td>
<td>Even if they say I'm being naive... Even if preventing the threat of Alchemy should take precedence...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>295</td>
<td>I just can't seem to force myself to prioritize the greater good, because I want to fight for the happiness of the individuals around me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>296</td>
<td>Wait... Don't tell me... Did you quit the Holy Guard?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>297</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>298</td>
<td>...Foolhardy as ever, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>299</td>
<td>Actually, we fools prefer the term "stubborn."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>300</td>
<td>Heh... You never change. Always thinking about others. You have always been the smarter, more compassionate one between the two of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>301</td>
<td>Flattery will get you nowhere. Your entire legion of people, though...that's a whole different story. Gives your words a little more weight than they used to have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>302</td>
<td>Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>303</td>
<td>Listen up, everyone! From here on out, Vettel here is a member of the Scarlet Legion! Be gentle with him when teaching him the ropes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>304</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>305</td>
<td>Where else is a disgraced knight like you going to go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>306</td>
<td>Gerald, you're a saint! What do you think...Vettel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>307</td>
<td>Uh, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>308</td>
<td>Also, I would like for you to take my place as the leader.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>309</td>
<td>Wha...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>310</td>
<td>...?! But that's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>311</td>
<td>Listening to you has made it clear you're the better fit to lead the Scarlet Legion into the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>312</td>
<td>I am much more suited to just swinging my blade around, vanquishing our enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>313</td>
<td>W-wait a minute! You want Vettel to be our new leader?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>314</td>
<td>Exactly. Does anybody object?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>315</td>
<td>Yes!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>316</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>317</td>
<td>Heh... Hahaha!</td>
