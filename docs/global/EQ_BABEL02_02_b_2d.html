<td>You, elven swordsman... Thank you for saving our village!</td>

<td>O-oh, you are too kind! Thank you!</td>

<tr>
<td>Cleric</td>
<td>Hello, elven friends. I am the cleric posted in this village to preach the teachings of the Holy Order of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cleric</td>
<td>I am deeply grateful for your help in defending our village.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/saha.png" alt="Zahar" height="128"><br>Zahar</td>
<td>It was nothing. We simply happened to be passing through.</td>

<tr>
<td>Cleric</td>
<td>By the way... I noticed that the two of you not only possess Alchemia, but also make use of alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/saha.png" alt="Zahar" height="128"><br>Zahar</td>
<td>Yes. Is that a problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cleric</td>
<td>No, no. During these troubled days, we all must make use of whatever tools we have to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cleric</td>
<td>I was just wondering if you had heard of the knights of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leti.png" alt="Letitia" height="128"><br>Letitia</td>
<td>Of course. I do not believe there is anyone who has not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cleric</td>
<td>It seems that recently they have been having trouble finding new recruits with the requisite strength of body and heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cleric</td>
<td>I am sure they would welcome courageous travelers such as yourselves into their ranks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cleric</td>
<td>They accept both elven folk and therians these days. The only requirement is strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/saha.png" alt="Zahar" height="128"><br>Zahar</td>
<td>You want us...to become Paladins?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cleric</td>
<td>Exactly! There would be training, and a trial to pass, but...I am willing to put you two forward as candidates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cleric</td>
<td>As a Paladin, you would be granted the authority to use alchemy as you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/saha.png" alt="Zahar" height="128"><br>Zahar</td>
<td>Hm... A Paladin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leti.png" alt="Letitia" height="128"><br>Letitia</td>
<td>What do you think, Zahar? The headquarters of the Holy Order is in Northern Pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leti.png" alt="Letitia" height="128"><br>Letitia</td>
<td>It sits at the foot of the Tower of Babel. If we join the Holy Guard, we would be able to see the Tower from up close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/saha.png" alt="Zahar" height="128"><br>Zahar</td>
<td>That is true... I suppose that this would be a good opportunity for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leti.png" alt="Letitia" height="128"><br>Letitia</td>
<td>Heheh. It might be interesting to try being Paladins for a while. It would be something new, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/saha.png" alt="Zahar" height="128"><br>Zahar</td>
<td>Protect the order of the world as a Paladin? Hmmm. Cleric, if you truly mean to recommend us, we will accept the opportunity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cleric</td>
<td>It would be my honor. I shall write the letter of recommendation right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cleric</td>
<td>Hmhmhm... How lucky. If I am able to return to headquarters with such valuable recruits for the Holy Guard, perhaps they'll take me back...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/saha.png" alt="Zahar" height="128"><br>Zahar</td>
<td>This is a fantastic opportunity. I shall join the Holy Guard and gain the strength to change this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/saha.png" alt="Zahar" height="128"><br>Zahar</td>
<td>I cannot gain such strength as a simple nomad who wanders aimlessly.</td>
