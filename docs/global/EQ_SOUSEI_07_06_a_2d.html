<td>Simply...amazing...</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Let's leave this area. If they surround us, they'll cut us down easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Do you truly think you can escape?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Kubera!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You have done well to survive my elite Avaritia soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>However, I told you, did I not? The people of Avaritia strive to be the strongest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We spare no one who gets in the way of that ideal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You don't need parts from a dragon to defeat a Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What is needed is a spell to strip them of their sin, and gear with that spell carved into it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yna and I can prepare that. However—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You, too, have faced one of these beasts, have you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You have learned of how to cut down a Cursed Beast with your own hands and come to tell us how to do so. Is that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Nevertheless, what we seek is an unparalleled blade! Not just the Cursed Beast, but even the gods who lord above us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I will cut them down with these two hands. It is for this purpose that I desire the ultimate gear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Even gods?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The gods that decided the laws of this world. Their true form is as descendants of the dragons that have lived since ancient times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Master...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Dragon scales are nigh indestructible. A regular sword cannot scratch them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Which means, we should use the dragon. Gear made with the magil and hardness of its scales would possibly be enough to lop off a god's head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>While that may be true...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Skreeeee...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You really intend to take the life of this small creature?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If it is the path to strength! We will proceed without hesitation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Surrender, traveler.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The strange technique you use is indeed troublesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>However, no matter how you struggle, my blade is faster than yours at this distance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>(My wound has reopened.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Nimul, watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>B-Benika?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Benika! Why did you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>H-he's...your friend...right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm a failure, so I cause...a lot of problems for you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>And you two had to fight...because of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Which is why...it should be me who...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Why would you do something so stupid?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ehe...he...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'll use a healing spell! To be honest, my Spiritbonding-based spell doesn't work so well on the Fallen, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Aghh! Hurts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The bleeding isn't stopping. Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Grrr... Healing that's not purification... Damn it, if only I had learned a little magic from Ambrosia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Why do you look down on us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Now's not the time! Can't you see that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Is this sentimentality, protecting the weak and prioritizing healing? It is an unfamiliar principle to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Nevertheless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It vexes me that such a trivial matter should ruin my chance of meeting someone powerful and measuring my own strength against them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We Avaritia soldiers are born with a resistance to corruption because all those who could not resist it died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Therefore, to us, corruption is either meaningless, or some bond that forms flesh and blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If this girl is a Fallen—if she is struck with the same corruption as us—her wounds should be healed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ahh... Gaahhh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What is it?! She's in pain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That is the girl's weakness, being unable to control the corruption within herself. However, that is what is keeping her alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What follows is your own decision. You can take pity on her and kill her. Or you can force her to stay alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>In this region, all is forgiven of the strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>All...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Arghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Are you all right, Benika?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Y-you can't...come...out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>This miasma is...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Grrooooooarrrgghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Benika was born a Fallen. Chosen as a part of the sin of greed and sent to corrupt this realm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>She is Mammon's priestess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Ahhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Scrah...aaahhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>The corruption overflowing from its body is...turning into the Fallen? What is going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>It's just like what happened to Julia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Producing Fallen from nothing is the power of a Cursed Beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Benika. You were destined to succumb to sin from the moment you were born, you wretched weakling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Your corruption will not work on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>For we have no sin to be corrupted by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Through our long history of self-discipline, we left the sin of greed behind long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>It's laughable that you think you can deprive us of our rapture! There's no meaning to prosperity at the expense of others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What we seek is the pinnacle of strength! Where no one can defeat us, a place no one else can reach!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>We are bonded by blood and the hope that one amongst us can attain that ultimate position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>If sin dwells within the weakness of the heart, then we have no more use for sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You said you would leave this to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Benika is still fighting it. She's fighting the sin she was born with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Lord Kubera, if you are a man who values power above all else; a man who considers continuing to fight honorable...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Is wresting my sister away from me in the midst of her battle truly the correct action to take?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Heh. Well said. Then demonstrate to me how you will stop your sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>She will turn into an instrument of corruption—of Mammon—momentarily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Nimul, lend me your power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>But Yna... Since she's been a Fallen since birth, the power of purification would—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I know. I want you to ward away the surrounding corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I will handle Benika.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>All right. Leave the surrounding Fallen to me, Yna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Aaaarrrrrggghhh!</td>
</tr>
