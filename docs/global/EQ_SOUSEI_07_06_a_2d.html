<td>Let's leave this area. If they surround us, they'll cut us down easily.</td>

<td>Kubera</td>
<td>You have done well to survive my elite Avaritia soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>However, I told you, did I not? The people of Avaritia strive to be the strongest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>We spare no one who gets in the way of that ideal.</td>

<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>What is needed is a spell to strip them of their sin, and gear with that spell carved into it.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Yna and I can prepare that. However—!</td>

<td>Kubera</td>
<td>You, too, have faced one of these beasts, have you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>You have learned of how to cut down a Cursed Beast with your own hands and come to tell us how to do so. Is that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Nevertheless, what we seek is an unparalleled blade! Not just the Cursed Beast, but even the gods who lord above us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>I will cut them down with these two hands. It is for this purpose that I desire the ultimate gear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Even gods?</td>

<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>The gods that decided the laws of this world. Their true form is as descendants of the dragons that have lived since ancient times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Master...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Dragon scales are nigh indestructible. A regular sword cannot scratch them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roh Ku</td>
<td>Which means, we should use the dragon. Gear made with the magil and hardness of its scales would possibly be enough to lop off a god's head.</td>

<td>Surrender, traveler.</td>

<td>However, no matter how you struggle, my blade is faster than yours at this distance.</td>

<td>H-he's...your friend...right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>I'm a failure, so I cause...a lot of problems for you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>And you two had to fight...because of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>Which is why...it should be me who...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Why would you do something so stupid?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>Ehe...he...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Aghh! Hurts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>The bleeding isn't stopping. Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Grrr... Healing that's not purification... Damn it, if only I had learned a little magic from Ambrosia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Why do you look down on us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Now's not the time! Can't you see that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Is this sentimentality, protecting the weak and prioritizing healing? It is an unfamiliar principle to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Nevertheless...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>It vexes me that such a trivial matter should ruin my chance of meeting someone powerful and measuring my own strength against them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>We Avaritia soldiers are born with a resistance to corruption because all those who could not resist it died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Therefore, to us, corruption is either meaningless, or some bond that forms flesh and blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>If this girl is a Fallen—if she is struck with the same corruption as us—her wounds should be healed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>Ahh... Gaahhh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>What is it?! She's in pain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>That is the girl's weakness, being unable to control the corruption within herself. However, that is what is keeping her alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>What follows is your own decision. You can take pity on her and kill her. Or you can force her to stay alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>In this region, all is forgiven of the strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>All...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>Arghhh!</td>

<tr>

<td>Are you all right, Benika?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>Y-you can't...come...out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>Grrooooooarrrgghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Benika was born a Fallen. Chosen as a part of the sin of greed and sent to corrupt this realm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>She is Mammon's priestess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>Ahhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Luke</td>
<td>Scrah...aaahhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>The corruption overflowing from its body is...turning into the Fallen? What is going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>It's just like what happened to Julia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Producing Fallen from nothing is the power of a Cursed Beast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Benika. You were destined to succumb to sin from the moment you were born, you wretched weakling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Your corruption will not work on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>For we have no sin to be corrupted by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Through our long history of self-discipline, we left the sin of greed behind long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>It's laughable that you think you can deprive us of our rapture! There's no meaning to prosperity at the expense of others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>What we seek is the pinnacle of strength! Where no one can defeat us, a place no one else can reach!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>We are bonded by blood and the hope that one amongst us can attain that ultimate position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>If sin dwells within the weakness of the heart, then we have no more use for sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>You said you would leave this to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Benika is still fighting it. She's fighting the sin she was born with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Lord Kubera, if you are a man who values power above all else; a man who considers continuing to fight honorable...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Is wresting my sister away from me in the midst of her battle truly the correct action to take?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>Heh. Well said. Then demonstrate to me how you will stop your sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kubera</td>
<td>She will turn into an instrument of corruption—of Mammon—momentarily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>Nimul, lend me your power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>But Yna... Since she's been a Fallen since birth, the power of purification would—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>I know. I want you to ward away the surrounding corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yna</td>
<td>I will handle Benika.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>All right. Leave the surrounding Fallen to me, Yna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benika</td>
<td>Aaaarrrrrggghhh!</td>
