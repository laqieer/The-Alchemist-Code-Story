<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Now then... The investigation is done. All that's left is finishing the report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey! Cheryl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's been a while! What a surprise running into you here. Are you also working on something now? </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yes, and by you saying "also," I assume you're here with mercenary work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yup. Just finishing up guard duties. It seems you're travelling to many places because of all the requests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's right. It also means they're recognizing my talents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well, there are a lot of things going on for me as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>A lot of things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Really! Listen, Cheryl! Reagan did it again with...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...um, this'll be a long story. Actually, you and I have been so busy recently and we haven't been able to talk much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Since we're together now, why don't we have lunch together? I know of a good place with spicy food which I know you love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Sounds good! Oh... but I'm sorry. I still have to finish writing my report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm planning to take a break after work is done... And the report is part of that so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You're a workaholic... Don't be so hard on yourself and be a little flexible, won't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Flexible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh... Sorry. Maybe it's too sudden and work is important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>An inquisitor's work must be difficult, and you probably don't have much free time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No, it's not like that. Some people write up their reports after returning to headquarters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Although there are regulations stating that reports should be written after an investigation is complete, so I'm trying to follow the rules...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So, it's okay then. Then, what's the problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Actually...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I cannot agree to this! Why are they allowed to do things their way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Even if we are discussing the extermination of heretics, it was against protocol to raid the laboratory without an inquisitor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, technically it was against protocol. But because of that, the heretics were caught. We have to be a little flexibile with the rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That may be so... But there should be consequences!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Inquisitors must follow the rules. If they don't, then what is the purpose of having rules? It is their role to make people follow protocol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Cheryl... What you say makes sense and of course it's important to follow protocol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But if we follow every rule and regulation, we're bound to miss important details along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Cheryl. Do not forget where we place our stance on rule violations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I see. So that's what happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I know there's a point in what you and my superiors are saying. But I just can't accept it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>As I see it, if we follow the rules, we won't end up like them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(Like those who become so obsessed in their research that they forget about their own daughter...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Cheryl...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>â€¦If you break the rules, the offender as well as the people around will suffer the consequences... So it's my duty to follow the rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Sadness from losing someone important can't be repeated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Plus, as an inquisitor, I should be tough on myself as well. I have to take the lead on bringing down the heretics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I really admire how strict you are, Cheryl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But you sometimes have to just take a break.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>And so... Let's eat some... Aaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Nnngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hey, are you okay? I'm sorry about that... What's all this? Your clothes all torn up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>And that pale complexion. It's like something scared the soul out of you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ah, there you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You're wasting our time. Hurry, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>N...No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hey, what do you think you're doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>This little girl is injured... Let go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hm? Who the heck are you two? Get out of the way.</td>
</tr>
