<td>Wadatsumi Expedition - Departure Date<br>Holy Guard - Headquarters</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I remember something I need to do. You go on ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Saga... I haven't been here since the wind shrine. It's good to see you're doing well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You are captain of the honorable 4th Regiment. There is no need for you to be hiding like that. Do you have business with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What's going on? Wait...are you really at the center of the Holy Order?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Heheh. I told so, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Lord Commander, what did you talk about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I heard that a large-scale plan was underway, so I came to give my blessing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Your blessing? While dragging that many individuals behind you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It just means it's that important to a mission. For us of the council as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Am I to assume that you're aware of the plan as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Of course. However...I heard that your 4th Regiment has been removed this particular mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No matter how much you search, I cannot you tell about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Heh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Heheh... Well, that's just a front. if you want to know, then I call tell you. After all, we're friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Tsk! Don't toy with me like that...just tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Don't get up all of a sudden like that. This time, the biggest goal of their mission is to destroy the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The Spirit Stone Mikaboshi...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It is a secret treasure that lies dormant within Wadatsumi. Its power is said to be equivalent to that of a Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wadatsumi's...secret treat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's existence was thought to be that of something only told of in legends, however...the real artifact was found just the other day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>In some ways, you can call it the discovery of the millennium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If it were to fall into someone else's hands, it will be a threat of the likes never seen before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I understand. Currently, an equilibrium is maintained in this world due to the 7 Sacred Stones distributed throughout this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Speaking of the power balance, the appearance of this new power source into extremely delicate equilibrium can give birth to new conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Thus, at the end of our discussion, its destruction was ultimately decided upon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>How tragic...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>In other words ... the destination of this expedition is Wadatsumi? Why was excluded?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I know more than any knight when it comes to knowledge about Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You could call this fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I was planning on paying the 4th Regiment a visit, but I hadn't expected them to show up instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Enough with the intro. Get the main points.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The reason you were removed from the expedition was due to my instructions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>As the entire Holy Guard would be heading out, the Lord Commander proposed that he would take charge of the office.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You took us off?! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>All of it is was for emergency insurance... I had no idea you would be selected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Insurance...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Didn't you say the same thing earlier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Should, the Mikaboshi fall into the hands of another...there will be no larger threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Those eyes...can you turn them towards a relative.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>A relative? No way ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>This matter may bring about a large effect on the outside world that will last for future generations. It must be turned towards the eyes of all people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Among other things, under the pretext of absolute justice, that man carries an abnormal obsession for the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You saw me impatiently attempting to go about matters, and, worried about this, you made an appearance at my door, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No...! Are you referring to the Lord Commander Zain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Exactly. That man is attempting to do all he can to obtain that absolute power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>However...when it comes to Zain, each captain is too loyal to him. They will not suspect him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>He proposed that, in case of an emergency, one captain should be left behind in this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You scum! Are you trying to make me distrust the Lord Commander by sowing baseless doubts within me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Baseless?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I cannot believe those words. Good bye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hehe.</td>
