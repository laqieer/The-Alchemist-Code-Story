<td>Come on, drink up. Once this antidote starts working, you'll be back to normal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Numa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, I'm cured! Thank the gods!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I only expected a pair of cute Ratty ears, not a total Rattening! I thought I was going to be stuck that way forever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm glad you are all right. Might I ask where you came by this potion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>There were a bunch lying in a box over thataway. It said they were just Halloween novelties, so I figured I'd try a little drop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Sure, I grew some Ratty ears, but they disappeared after a second, so I reckoned it was safe to drink the whole thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The effects do differ depending on dosage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What kind of fool drinks roadside potions in the first place?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Rosa? I thought you said you had disposed of those potions safely?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I did, after a fashion... Look, do I look like I know how to dispose of garbage? Someone else always dealt with that for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Good grief... All right, you come with me. We'll make sure all the new Ratties around town get the antidote.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, I just remembered! I saw the orphanage director taking a bunch of bottles back with him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A bunch...? Say, isn't that kinda really bad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Indeed. We must stop it before it gets worse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Unbelievable! Why would that girl even make such a potion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Even so, I'm a little jealous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Of those who have been turned into Ratties?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That isn't what I meant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Certainly, self-restraint is not one of Rosa's strong points.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But she is positively overflowing with ideas for ways to surprise and delight other people, which I find admirable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I simply don't have her creative spark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Julia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But look at me, feeling sorry for myself when other people need my help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Say, Julia? Once we've sorted this out, how about we think of something together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>There's got to be a pleasant surprise out there that fits you perfectly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What's more, we shall help you find it! For the Successor of the Sun, no prank is impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I don't understand. Why would the two of you go so far for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ah... Well, I should apologize on that score. My passion can burn a little hot at times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>My feelings, however, are sincere. I truly do wish for you to join the rest of us in enjoying this festival. As such...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I understand what you're asking. However...I don't have any right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What are you on about? Everyone's got the right to a happy Halloween.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Your thoughts are on the person you served, are they not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>How do you know about her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>"If only I could share these joys with the one I served. They are rather wasted on me." Your words, I believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Of course, I would not presume to know your past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I do, however, wish to ask: would this individual want you to spend Halloween in sadness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Of course not. She was always kind towards me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Then what holds you back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The issue is not what she would want, but what I can allow myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I was charged with protecting her. That was all I needed to do, all I COULD doâ€”but in the end, I failed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>When I laid down my life in her defense, I left her to walk her thorny road alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You...died for her...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>My duty was to remain by her side for as long as she needed me. I...could not fulfil that duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>A failure such as myself has no right to enjoy these festivities. For me even to be here is wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>This must be why ideas for pleasant surprises still elude me. I cannot bring any joy to others if there is none in my own heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That's not true at all! It can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You gave your life to save this person! How do you think they'd feel to know you were torturing yourself over it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Blanchett...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I kind of know what you mean when you say you feel out of place here. I felt the same way, once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>All I could think about was getting revenge. In my mind, a moment spent enjoying myself was a moment wasted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Then someone told me something: "Revenge is only a small part of who you are."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>"Even if your revenge ends, your life will continue. That's why you should start thinking about what happens when it's all over."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>And that goes for you too. No matter how important your duty was to you, it's only one part of you. You're bigger than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Only one...part of me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>And you know, you did say you liked my cutouts. It made me really happy to hear that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You even said my scissors were like their own kind of magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Whoever this person was, she must have been very kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm sure that you hurting yourself like this is the last thing she'd want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Your love for her alone would convince me of her good character. I cannot believe she would want you to suffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ramses...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Perhaps this is merely more unwelcome advice, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I cannot accept that someone who worked so hard to ready this carnival for others is not entitled to enjoy it themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>This Halloween belongs to the Successor of the Sun, and I decree that it shall bring happiness to all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Happiness...to all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You have always served me well. I only want you to be happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Lady Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It's only natural that I should wish for my friend's happiness, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I never meant to tie myself in knots like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>In my final moments, I was so certain that was the end. Of everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>But I...all of us, rather, have been given time that we never expected. We mustn't waste it being shackled to old parts of ourselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Your duty is but one small part of you, Julia. There is much more that even you are yet to discover.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>There must be, for are we not here with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I suppose you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>(I'm still not certain I'm ready to think about my own happiness yet, but if my duty is really only one small part of myself...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>(Then I want to learn what the other parts are, and try to find one I can hold dear.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>This must be the orphanage. It's rather in a state, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Look! The children!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Waaaaah! Help us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What's wrong? What is happening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>The director drank a load of weird potions, and he... He...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You're kidding me! He turned into that?! It's ginormous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Numa! Numa! Nuuumaaa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>All those potions must have destabilized his body. The Ratties from before don't even compare to this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Stay behind us, little ones! Fear not, for we shall protect you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Nu...numumuuu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Watch out! It's coming for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Nu... Nu... Numyuaaa!</td>
</tr>
