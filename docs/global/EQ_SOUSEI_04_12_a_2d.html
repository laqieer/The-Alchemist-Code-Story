<td>So you've finally made it here, Pursuers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I hope you do not expect that this battle will be like those that you've faced before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Beelzebub is the Cursed Beast that rules over Gluttony. Inside his body, he breathes in all of the life that has fallen into sin even now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This is why the ancestors of the Sephira worked with Nidhogg to seal Beelzebub away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>From the very beginning, none of you could ever have the means to defeat Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast of Gluttony consumes all, and from that spawns more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>A never-ending cycle of sin. In addition...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>At present, three cores lie inside Beelzebub's body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No matter how much you study or sharpen your skills, it is already much too late to accomplish anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It all ends here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>With the true awakening of this Cursed Beast, the world shall descend into sin once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The barrier between corruption and purification will vanish, and this land will be unified again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What's this shaking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ahhh! What's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What's happened?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Sephiron... Mother of All... The Tree of Life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What happened to Sephiron! Tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Sephiron... The Tree of Life has been...devoured by the Cursed Beast? It...can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This is the end! We've lost everything! Our salvation is gone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No! Sephiron is the one symbol of hope to the people of Sephira...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>For them to lose that hope after suffering through all of this... This is beyond their capacity to endure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But not only that... Corruption is spreading from their sephirah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Aaaahh.... Aaah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No, no, no, no, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Everyone, calm down! We still have the protection of Sephiron! We can fight with the aid of the Godwolf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No... No... Aaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's over... It's over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No... They aren't listening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>At this rate, they will become Sinners... What should we do, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Urgh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Eulalia...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>"In the beginning, there was sin; the Tree of Life, our great mother, our light came to purify it..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That prayer... The prayer to succeed the Vessel of Purification...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>"Crowns set aside and knowledge gained, to be distributed to the kingdoms..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That light... Oh, this is the warmth of Sephiron!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>My anxiety... My fears! They're gone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Eulalia has taken their sin. But that would mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Is everyone...okay...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I have become the Priestess of Sephiron. It is my duty as the acting Vessel of Purification...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Compared to being sealed away inside of a Cursed Beast, this is fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Forget me! Now's your chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Understood! Waginau, I'm counting on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I've got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Warriors, remember our mission! This crumbling world needs us now, more than ever. This is where we make our last stand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The great tree no longer stands tall before us, but the compassion of its priestess is still here with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>So we warriors of Sephira must rise to the occasion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Lord Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Apologies... We are ready to return to the battlefield!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Good! Let's combine our power, and continue down the road our chief Nimul has carved for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Onward march!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaaahhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>If we encounter any Sinners, we will take care of them! Nimul and the others will head toward the source of this allâ€”the Cursed Beasts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hmph... This is definitely the role I'm most suited for...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Let's march, fellow warriors! Now is the time to demonstrate our hard-won mastery of Spiritbonding!</td>
