<td>Huzzzaaahhhh!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Monzein...who would've thought he was such a warrior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>His demonic way of fighting...if possible, I would've liked to have had him on our side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ugh...! What are you saying? Such a wild way of fighting wouldn't last for very long...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Lightning Axe!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What...?! He still possesses that much power?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I still can't seem to see an end in sight. At this rate, do you not think we'll end up with more crushed versions of our boastful prototypes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>N-no...I would hardly think so...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Heheh... Now then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>King of Envylia...it is about time you handed over Leviathan to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huff...huff...! Argh! What speed. It's like I can't even see her movement!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>No...is it really a matter of speed? Even I can't discern it with my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Now isn't the time for unnecessary thoughts! We don't have much time...huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Huh...?! B-Bud...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry! My arm just started moving on its...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh...have the two of you started to play together? It's rude of you to leave a lady on her own. I thought you were gentlemen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Argh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ack! Basheeny, forget about me! Just get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Don't be stupid! Of course I can't do that! Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Then kill me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Heheh. I guess your boastful Phantom Arts aren't very useful if you're being pulled down by your friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>All right then, shall we end it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Bud, behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Agh! M-my body...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Basheeny! Bud!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Argh! Don't get in my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>All right then. Let's start with you! Now let me hear your final cries of sheer agony!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Those are the men who will inherit my code of chivalry. I will not allow you to harm them!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hey, what is this?! Stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hyaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Why doesn't it work?! Stop! I said stop! Stoooop!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ugh...?! M-Monzein...! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hmph. A knight who is truly prepared is a knight who cannot be decieved!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Wh-what is this...?! Ack... Let go of me!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Agh...!!! Ackkk...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Y-yes...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>My fingers are free!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ugff...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Captain?! Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ugh...ghh. I still have nearly half of my strength left!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>B-but it seems like my time...is almost over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Sorry, but once you meet up with Yauras and the others...I'll have to leave the rest to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...! Captain...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'll...get started on my last task. I can't afford to finish emptyhanded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Wait...are you talking about Orion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You want me to give you Leviathan?! You idiot! I would never comply with such a demand...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>King of Envylia...think carefully before you answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Once we eliminate that lot...our swords will be pointed at the people of this country. Do you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>If you offer up your Sacred Stone, you'll be able to avoid meaningless casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>First you attempt to control me and now you're threatening me? You don't seem to really understand Leviathan, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The jealousy that rests within Leviathan...it can only be inherited by another if I will it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>In other words...even if you mentally manipulate me or attempt to threaten me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Without my will, none of it matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>If I were to release it, it would lose its power more and more...and eventually be nothing more than a pebble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>In other words...unless you truly want to give it away, I won't be able to possess it for my own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Yes. And, as long as I'm alive...I will never allow that to happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I see. I'm glad we were able to have this talk. It saves me both time and effort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>This is what I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Aghh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...! What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Your Majesty!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Ug...ggh...! Y-you scum!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>My goal is to destroy the balance of power in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I had wished to obtain the Sacred Stone for myself, but even if it is to become as useless as a pebble...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>As long as that equilibrium is broken, that's all that matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Y-Your Majesty! My king!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Bu...Bud...Ta...take Leviathan to the prince. As long as the Sacred Stone is...safe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Your Majesty!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I see... What you say is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>As if to pursue your death, Your Majesty, the Alchemy energy is disappearing from Leviathan. Heheh. How interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Tsk...! Interesting?! Doesn't human life mean anything to you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Human life? It's the cornerstone of what moves this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>The cornerstone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Those who are chosen by fate move this world. All others serve as cornerstones for such individuals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>That is how this world's history has been spun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Don't worry. I'll have your life serve as the foundation for my rule. Get rid of him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Even if history displays me that way...even if that is the reality that I cannot escape...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>At the very least...my code of chivalry will not forgive you!!! Huzzzaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>...! His power has increased again?! He might very well come charging in to our army! His overconfidence is getting the better of him. Attack!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Y-you gotta be kidding me. After just how much you've made fun of me...do you think I'd let you get away with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...You!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>If I restrain you from this distance, you won't be able to lay a finger on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I'll have to at least have Orion be in my debt or there's no telling what Sol might say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Ack! I won't let you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...?! That power! Don't tell me... Did you use that power?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Are you planning on engaging in single-handed battle with Orion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You're an idiot. You're planning on abiding by your code of chivalry until the very end, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>C-Captain Yauras...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>...! Captain Yauras...of the 1st Regiment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>The main troops have entered the vicinity already. They are intercepting the Scarlet Flame Guard. It'll be okay now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Hmph. According to Sieba, you're confident when it comes to agility, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>In that case, how about it? What does it feel like to be attacked from behind? Does it send shivers down your spine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Captain Yauras, behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Maybe it feels like the sensation you're experiencing right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Huh?! Behind me...?! Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>The damage that she received from Captain Monzein...it's still there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Monzein may have gone easy on you because you're a woman, but I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I will not let you interfere with these knights who are putting their lives on the line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...! Yauras...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Monzein! Don't worry...leave the rest to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I will witness the end of your walk down the path of chivalry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>And...taking on your resolve...I will become even stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Ugh! Arrghhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Slender Twin-Blade!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Aghh!!! Ackk!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Heh... I'll leave the rest to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Ugh...ghh! J-just a little more...! Hold on just a little more...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Huzzzzaaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>What?! He doesn't stop! No...in fact, he's even faster than before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>What a fighting spirit he has. Heheh. It makes my blood boil even hotter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Your Highness...what are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I want to dedicate a flower in celebration of the first step of our assault.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Orion...! Out of the way!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Heheh. The Great Thunder Axe...will you be able to take the head of the Lion Monarch?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Of course! Prepare yourself, you King of Beasts!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>He flew?! No...! Emperor Orion!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Hmph...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Ugh...?! Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Impressive, Monzein...taking on such a massive army...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>You are a glorious warrior! To be honest...I regret that I will have to end you, however...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Ugh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>As one who aims to rule... I cannot allow myself to stop moving forward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Unfortunately...it is too dangerous to allow you to remain alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Scatter into the wind, you brave and just knight! Let the blade of the Lion Monarch erase your existence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Captain Monzein!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>...Ugff...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>...Ukkk...! Uggkkkk...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>...! He is pushing Orion's sword back...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>It can't be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>...Aghhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>He made Orion's blade ricochet! He can still win this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Emperor Orion!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>I am Captain Monzein of the Holy Guard's 2nd Regiment!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>In the name of justice, I will take your life, Lion Monarch Orion!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Ac...ack!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>...Agh...?! Ugh...ghhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>What...?! Leviathan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Ta...take it, Basheeny!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>?! Ouch! Captain M-Monzein...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Wh-why...have you stopped your attack?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>...! No, it can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Rather than saving his own life...he chose to save that rock instead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>He must know that Leviathan has lost its effect. What is this supposed to mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>I-it means that thing you hold is far more important than your existence...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Uck...uckkk... Take the Sacred Stone...and use its true power wisely...ugfff!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>It can't be! The effects have already...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Th...the true power...of the Sacred Stone...is not the Alchemy energy...encapsulated within it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>The hearts of those...who gather...the Sacred Stones...will be passed on...to the next generation...giving meaning...to the will of the people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>The will of the people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>The true power...of the Sacred Stone...is its force...to connect the souls...of all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Whe...whether it were to be transformed into a pebble...that effect...will not...vanish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Ugh...ghh...! S-someone like you...who can only see the power...that lies before their eyes...will never understand this...until the day...you die...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Your Majesty, don't allow yourself to indulge in such silly dialogue...finish him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>...Enough!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Your...Your Majesty?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>This man was able to corner me to this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>I will not permit any other to lay a hand on him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Besides...there is no longer any need to finish him off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>D-does that mean...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>............</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>C...Captain Monzein!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>We're heading out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Huh? Wh-what are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Waginau...you understand, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>The line that that man drew...no matter how many troops we had, we could not cross it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Besides...the immortal soldiers that Vier manipulated have been destroyed. What can we do now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Not to worry. Whether we gain control here or not doesn't change the final outcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Captain Yauras! In honor of this man I will withdraw from this place as promised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>However, next time things will not be so easy. If you wish to stand in my way, I will not hold back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>Right back at you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Hmph. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>Tsk! Are we just going to let him go free?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Both the Scarlet Flame Guard and the Blue Flame Guard have suffered more casualties than expected...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Even adding our reinforcements, it's likely to assume our damage will only increase further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Seeing the current state of this city as well...it would be best to focus on rebuilding it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Tsk! Arghh!!! This is...! This is so unfair!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Ugh...ghh! Captain Monzein! Bwahaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>...Basheeny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Why? Why?! Why did it have to be like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>This is all wrong! Why does Captain Monzein have to die...and I get to keep living?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Basheeny...calm down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>I-I can't calm down!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Captain Monzein was supposed to hate me! But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Why did he continue to protect me?! This is all wrong! I was the one who was supposed to die!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Ughh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>Pull yourself together. Crying isn't going to fix anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>If you have time to do that, then remember in your heart what he meant to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>He entrusted the future in your hands. You are now obliged to witness his end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Look carefully...witness the final moment of this brave knight who continued to maintain his honor until the very end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>Waa...waahhh! Ca...Captain Monzein...!!! Waaaahhhhh!!!</td>
