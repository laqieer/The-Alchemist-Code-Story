<td>All set, Paladin! We've finished our preparations and we're ready to assault the tower!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>We'll distract the homunculus. You take care of the guards and the tower itself!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Alright, leave it to us. Wait, do you smell that? It smells so good... Aw, man. I didn't realize the time...</td>

<td>No worries, I've got you covered! Here's meat on a stick, pickled plums, and the ever popular Colosseum Apple Pie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I can guarantee that these are the best of the best! I've sampled them all myself. Go on, eat up!</td>

<td>Lucky... I wish I could have some. It reminds me of Winry's apple pie.</td>

<td>Ooh, food talk! I want to know more about foods from your worlds! Oh, and about the diet of the Holy Order as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>I'm really looking forward to trying lots of different delicious foods with you, Teona!</td>
