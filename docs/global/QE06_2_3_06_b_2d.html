<td>…! I see... You are also a mixedblood… You've attained power surpassing “despair."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>However…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's no match for the power of the king. Yours is an incomplete awakening--you can't control your power...let alone--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>…defeat me without your horns!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You are powerless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...If you blame anyone, blame yourself and your own stupidity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Still, I should thank you. Thanks to you and the others, I was able to attain this body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This body has made me king and with the power it grants...Wadatsumi will belong to the demons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…Huzzaaaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>…Worthless insect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…Cheeky, aren't we--brushing me aside and calling yourself king of Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That is the reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>…I received a report of a disturbance at Koga's place… What on earth is going on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…You don't have to answer. One glance tells me all I need to know. Time to lay down the law.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You think you can stop me--a puny human?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Koga… Kaede…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Chief of humans, you shall meet a similar fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>…Heed my words, demon. Is there no turning back from the brink?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's too late for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>…You really intend to destroy the future that Koga and Kaede envisioned?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Without hesitation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That was always my intention. Wadatsumi is mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…So there's no turning back…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What need is there to go backwards… This will be your resting place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…You're forgetting one thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Slumbering Phoenix, heed my call. In the name of the Aquila Rubrum royal family, I beseech thee--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Imbibe my royal crimson blood, beat your wings and reign divine fire unto the earth--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...Kagutsuchi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>…My blood has resurrected the phoenix... If you hadn't broken the peace…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>We would have never had to fight again...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>The arcane power--Kagutsuchi…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>…Time to reconsider. We can still turn back. We don't need to break our truce.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Now that I have this body, even Kagutsuchi is no match for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Your fate is sealed. Fade into oblivion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>…You're wrong. You misjudge mankind's power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Koga's vision of the future fortified by Kaede's willpower--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That is what I shall inherit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>…What is…this power!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The capacity for people to care for one another is limitless. Even after countless trials and tribulations--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That capacity remains infinite…That is the power of human emotion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>…May you burn to ash. These are the true wings of the phoenix...The power of our combined wills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>…The love I have for Koga and Kaede… And for this great land of Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>This is the pinnacle of it all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Kagutsuchi-Kiraboshi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Gr…urrrrhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>…Urf…How could a such an insignificant human--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>…I didn't want it to come to this... However, doing nothing would have cost more lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>…If you must hate me, then hate me… I will carry that burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>…Do not think you can be done with me so easily! I will destroy all humans...and…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I will make Wadatsumi the kingdom of demons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...Farewell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Your existence cannot be erased. Therefore, it must be sealed tightly away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It is my hope…that you remain sealed away from this earth for all time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...I prayed that this day would never come…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>…Koga, Kaede…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Forgive me… Forgive me…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>…What is this…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>How did they manage to hide their children in a place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>In the wake of that event, the balance between humans and demons collapsed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The demons' exploded with resentment after losing the Discarnate Power and Tamba.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>As for the humans, they could no longer produce food capable of satisfying the demons without a visionary chef.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Above all, they lost Koga and Kaede. They turned all their resentment...on demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>…And thus</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The reconciliation was broken--taking with it a fleeting moment of peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>…That's awful! How could it be…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power! That's who's to blame... Wait a minute! No…there was someone else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>All is for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>That's right! It wasn't just the Discarnate Power. All this time, I thought that if we defeated the demons, our problems would be solved, but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>…Who is that man!? Does it mean that the demons aren't our only enemies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Not only did he lead the Demon Hunters, but you're saying he's connected to the Discarnate Power and the demons? I don't believe it. And yet…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>It's the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>This is…evil. It's as if everything that happened was this person's doing…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yes…it is evil. The heart of man can be just as "demonic" as a demon's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Then...we shouldn't only be fighting demons...!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>…That's how it seems for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Not all the truth has been revealed yet. Until we meet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Wait... Hey! WAIT!</td>
