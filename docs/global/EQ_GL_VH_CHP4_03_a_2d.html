<td>002</td>
<td>The yawning cavern seemed to swallow any semblance of sunlight fed into its maws.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Blair pulls out a small device, which begins to blink and buzz softly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hmm... Alchemia particle density appears normal and stable here. Nothing out of the ordinary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Shall we press on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This reminds me of when we first found Professor Minerva in the ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>One thing led to another, and all of a sudden thinking machines were involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Sure feels like an age ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yeah. Atropos was held in a vast underground facility just outside of a township near Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It was one of Professor Minerva's colleagues who tipped us off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I don't think any of us knew we'd be going down a rabbit hole...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I think I can imagine. I remember Roxanne saying that place was just packed with Constructs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You probably would've liked that, yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>A-Ahem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Let's head down that path. See if we can get any better readings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(Hmm... Nope. Can't feel a thing.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Blair sets down her device and begins planting a few more in its vicinity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Soren, I've never actually asked, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>How does it feel to experience those visions you keep having?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It can't be pleasant if it's of something you don't remember, can it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yeah, guess you could say it was pretty disturbing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Apart from what he did with the Constructs and Atropos and wanting a world free of bloodshed, I don't know much else about my past self.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>And now we've got this "Lachesis". I don't even know what she has to do with all this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, if you happen to get another vision here, my devices will be able to pick up fluctuations in Alchemia density per Professor Minerva's hypothesis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>From there, we can probably pinpoint a rough location of its source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I don't know how you figure things out so quickly. It's amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...It's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If only I turned up more about Lachesis. Emrys and I couldn't find anything we didn't already know about the Elylon Teg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>And if there are mentions of Lachesis, it was probably never by name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Surely something so important should have warranted a study, but Emrys did say his clan was quite reclusive...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What bothers me is whether she was a Construct at all. She definitely didn't sound like one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What if I'd made some other sentient entity using more than just machines? Is that even possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>If she's also powered by Alchemia, then Goetia might go down the same route as Zheng Yi once did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Orphans recruited under the banner of a twisted cause, made to sacrifice themselves in the name of a terrible ideal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Shion's report did make mention of that, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Given the relative age of the two assailants at Roxanne's manor, not to mention the leader Emrys ran into...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's not a stretch to conclude they may have been orphans, or even indoctrinated from birth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And if most of them suffer from poverty or sickness...it's even easier to keep them on a metaphorical leash.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What if they were just like Eira? That might explain the dread aura from that girl called Red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>This just gets worse and worse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Suddenly, a low rumble rocks the cavern. The devices go haywire, frantically beeping and flashing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I didn't detect any seismic movements before...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This frequency is definitely not coming from the earth itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Blair, look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>*growl*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>They must have been drawn by the sound!</td>
</tr>
