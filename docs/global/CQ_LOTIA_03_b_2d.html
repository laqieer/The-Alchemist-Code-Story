<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>C-curse you... If I wasn't injured... It's all this mongrel's damn fault!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My reputation as a gladiator is ruined thanks to this bloody devil. I'm gonna have to withdraw from the match in order to recover.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I thought these mutts were here to bring us glory, make us look good. If they can't even do that, then they should at least make themselves useful as hide and meat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Grrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No! Grraw!</td>

<td>Watch out!</td>

<td>If you cannot acknowledge your opponent as your equal, then you are unworthy of fighting in the Colosseum. You have nothing of worth to offer our audience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Matches aren't meant to be fought alone. A good match, an exciting one, is one fought by two warriors who hold mutual respect for one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It was my brother who taught me that.</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I...!</td>

<td>Equals...</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(I didn't think I'd ever find myself liking a gladiator, regardless of who they were. They've done nothing but hurt my family...my darlings. No gladiator has ever shown them so much as an ounce of kindness.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(Still, I can't help but wonder...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Have I really been fair? Have I truly been viewing humans and beasts as equals? Perhaps not...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Gladiators these days don't show any respect to the beasts and turn their noses up at us trainers. They think everybody else is beneath them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(But I don't think I could ever befriend a gladiator. Not after this...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Listen to me, Lotiyah. You must treat those around you equally and with kindness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>So long as you do, then surely...you will be able to understand one another.</td>

<td>Lotiyah!</td>

<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>L-Lotiyah... Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Regardless of one's reasons, no battle should be fought without mutual respect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That is how I train my beasts! As their trainer...and as their family, that is how I raise them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Even if you are their opponent...it is no different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Zeno told me once that to you trainers, these beasts you care for and discipline are...family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>He also said that...it doesn't matter who you fight. Everyone is important to someone, so you should respect all those you go up against. For that is the duty of a gladiator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I admired your brother so much. He's the reason I became a gladiator in the first place, you know. I guess I forgot that somewhere along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Grrw...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I'm gonna make my peace with him, and with you and yours, in the Colosseum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Fowow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It seems that he has some sense of honor after all. I, for one, am looking forward to the next match.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>U-um... Thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm still not sure why you helped me, though... No one's ever lifted a finger to do anything for my darlings before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Why, I thought that would be obvious. What kind of friend would I be if I didn't help you when you needed it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I see... So that's the kind of person you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'm sorry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(Teona treats those around her equally...and with kindness.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(It doesn't matter that she's a gladiator. I know I can definitely be friends with someone like her. There's no need for me to hold back any longer!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(Maybe I can even learn how to be more like her...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>By the way, did you know that a new cake shop opened up around here recently?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What? Really?! I had no idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Heheh. I only heard about it a short while ago myself. I still have to find out the exact location, but when I do, why don't we go together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I'd love to! Ohh, I've always wanted to do that! Sharing cake with a friend...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You don't know how happy I am to hear that. It's been my dream to go on a cake date with a friend for so long. Heheh!</td>
