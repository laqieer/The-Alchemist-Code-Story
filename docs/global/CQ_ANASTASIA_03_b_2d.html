<td>Scatter, you vermin!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Strange. There are too few...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Lady Anastasia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are there reinforcements?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Indeed! The rear troops are under attack and require assistance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'll head there immediately. I can't afford for us to lose any more troops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The amount of enemy troops here... I guess these aren't reinforcements, but the main army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'll scatter all of you! Hyaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Watch out! Behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Aghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Idiot! Why did you defend me?! I told you, didn't I? Getting hurt is part of my job!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm...sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Fung Liu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Look what you've done. I'll avenge my comrade's death by spilling your blood across the battlefield!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>U-um... Sorry to bother you when you're getting worked up, but...I'm all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What? Bu-but that wound...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, of course...it would be fatal in most cases, but...I'm a zombie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh? Anyway, tell me about it after I take out all the enemies around here. You better not die before that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see. So you're moving even though you're already dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm sorry I didn't explain it better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'd like to say that's impossible, but having seen the way that you are...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Long ago, I was also created to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But...with all the time that's passed, I've learned many different things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Things such as small moments of happiness and friends that will stand by your side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I don't enjoy hurting others, but I've decided to fight for the things that are important to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ultimately, it works to my own benefit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Fighting in order to protect something allows me to unleash the most strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That's foolish. It's all pointless if it causes you to die like you just did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Don't worry. After all, I can't die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's not very funny. ...Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I...wasn't trying to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Of course. My apologies. You may be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I feel like my means and purposes seem to have reversed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I should be fighting in order to protect something, not for the sake of fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes. It was like seeing my younger self in you...and I felt like I had to do something about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Thank you for making me realize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Right. Let me repay you. Recently, I've started doing engravings. I'll make an accessory that will suit you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I would...love that. In return, I'll knit you something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It'll take a bit of time, so...please don't die until then. Promise me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Right back at you. Heheh. It's a promise.</td>
