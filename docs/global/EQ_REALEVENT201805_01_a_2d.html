</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>Good question. The stage events and merchandise are all set to go. Should we review the course of events for the quest?</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>

<td>Oh, I know! Why don't we work that into the quest, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>It might not get a big laugh, but I can just see it now! The curtain rises, and Artist says, "I brought treats!" Thus, the enemy is charmed! I like it!</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>It's fine! Don't worry about it! It'll be great! It's just another one of those quests where you're encouraged to protect Artist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>

<td>Well, that's the whole plot device of this quest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>If you defeat Artist, then Designer will be upset and say something like, "How could you?!" and probably get a massive power up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>Yeah, and if Artist is all right, she'll just come back as if nothing happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>But Designer will just show up again. That's what happened in the last one! That's boring. Can't we have something more, well, sensational?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>Sensational? If we think about it like a content creator would, then... How about, "Vampire and Zombie"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>Okay. So what you're saying is that we'll come out at the same time. Something like... "The Vampire can't be defeated while the Zombie is protecting it."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Those would be our PR ambassadors? They don't seem fitting with TAC.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>A vampire, a zombie, and Designer? That's a bit of a heavy responsibility, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>Then, when you defeat the three of them, that's when Producer will appear, right? Some smaller enemies were supposed to pop up alongside him, but maybe we could change that, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Maybe a random TAC celebrity could appear. They're all really busy, so you never know who's going to show up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Don't forget about Director Ratty! He could give me a buff that makes me super strong, or something cool like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>I guess he could cast a buff that can't be dispelled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Yeah, like a final boss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>So, if they can defeat Director Ratty before the balance adjustment is complete, I'll be weakened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>It would be cool if my business cards contained Mementos and Vision Abilities so people with my cards could use them in battles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>You two could cheer on the player and get them all fired up when they use the Vision Abilities!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>All right. Got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>All right, I'm counting on you! If they can defeat me in the quest, they'll get a very exciting reward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>You can get a Lion Set and Enchantment Coins, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>Players will still be able to collect coins for the Enchanted Jobs for a while, too! I'm really excited about it, myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Right! I wouldn't let them make the rewards smaller than they were in the last one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>(Is it okay to give out so much? I'll have to check.)</td>
</tr>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>Anyway, I guess that's about it for this quest, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Um... Well, since we're going to Kobe and all... You know what they say! When in Rome, do as the Romans do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>When in Rome...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Wh-what do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Let's go Kansai style!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>That's a great idea! Atmosphere is important, after all. We should change how we talk, and our outfits and stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>I'll have to check the script, but I bet the costumes will be good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>Something like this, maybe? Don't I look elegant?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Looks great! We should start looking for something to wear, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>Hm... The size is right, but aren't they a bit too much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>Not at all! You look all wild and cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>If you say so... Wait, Producer hasn't come back yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>So this is... I don't think I'm allowed to say their name...but doesn't it look like a certain someone's clothes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
<td>Whoa! That's even flashier than I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>You can tell whose it is just by looking at it! All that red and white... It's really impressive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>Heh, even if it's just a rehash of the last live event's outfit, it still feels brand new!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ij.png" alt="TAC Producer" height="128"><br>TAC Producer</td>
<td>We're gonna make sure that this second TAC Live Event has a unique sense of drama, and an interesting strategy worthy of our audience!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_ishi.png" alt="TAC Artist" height="128"><br>TAC Artist</td>
<td>Okay. If they need anything from us, let us know! We'll do our best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/alc_fuji.png" alt="TAC Designer" height="128"><br>TAC Designer</td>
